Jesus called a little child to him and stood him among them.
Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."

partnershipriful things will come upon the world because of the things that drive people to sin! Such things must come. But what a partnershiprfulness for those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into eternal fire in hell with two hands and two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
Beware of despising one of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that is lost?
I believe I will tell you the truth. If he finds that sheep, he will be more glad about it than about the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
It is the same with your Father in heaven. He does not want to lose even one of these little ones. When one of them sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. The Scripture says, "On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed" (Deuteronomy 19:15).
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Do not treat him as a brother. Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." - The Merciless Servant
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother if he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When the king began to do that, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to pay off his debts.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me some time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him and let him go.
But that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant fell to his knees. 'Give me some time,' he begged. 'I will pay you back.'
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very worried about it. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the master called the first servant. He said to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant, as I showed mercy to you?
He handed him over to the slaves, furious. He will be punished until he pays off all his debts.
This is how your heavenly Father will treat you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator made them 'male and female' from the beginning?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a woman a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone is able to accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who have been given the ability to live without marriage can accept it.
"Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Others have been made that way by other people. And some have chosen this path for themselves to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Bring the children to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus laid his hands on them, and then departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man approached Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
The man asked, "Which ones?" Jesus answered, "You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all these commandments. What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you, it is harder for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished. And they said, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left all and followed you. Therefore, what will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, when all things are renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and you also who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also have eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, 'Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you a just wage.'
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock, he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, 'Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?'
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones hired and then go to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received his usual day's wage.
When the first ones hired came, they expected to get more wages. But each of them also received his usual day's wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the employer.
They said, "These people who were recently hired only worked for one hour, and you paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and were exposed to the sun all day."
The landowner answered one of them, "Friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the people I recently hired the same pay I gave you.
Isn't it my right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel resentful because I've been generous to others?
"Therefore the last shall be first, and the first last." Jesus speaks again about His upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. As he traveled, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem," "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and on the third day he will rise again!" A mother asks Jesus to grant her understanding.
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus with her sons. Falling at his feet, she asked him for a favor.
Jesus asked, "What do you want?" She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like this. Instead, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And anyone who wants to be first must be a slave to you.
"Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, saying, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd demanded that they stop. He ordered them to be quiet. But the two men cried out even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
They answered: "Sir, we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
And when they were come nigh to Jerusalem, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus his disciples,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied up, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away.
This happened to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet. The text says,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you; He is righteous and saved, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large crowd spread out and threw their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. And the people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple of the Lord and began to drive out all who bought and sold there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you make it a 'den of thieves.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind and lame people came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did, and they also saw the children in the temple court shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
They asked him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" Jesus replied, "Yes, have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. And He spent the night there. A fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done. Whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." This challenges Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'of men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
They answered him, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." - The Story of the Two Sons
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
The son replied, "I will not," but then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. He answered, 'I will, sir.' But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted? They said, "The first." Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw this. Yet, you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man had a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He surrounded it with a wall. He dug a winepress in it, and also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he traveled abroad on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, and commanded them to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated the servants in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do with those tenants?
They answered, "He will destroy those wicked men, and will rent the vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
This is what I am telling you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and the stone on which they fall will crush them.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Dinner Party Story at the Wedding
Jesus told them more parables. He said,
This is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fat calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But the people didn't care. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest seized his servants. They treated them cruelly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The dinner is ready, but the guests are not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
The servants went out into the streets. They gathered everyone they could find, good and bad. Within moments, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He found a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said to her, "My friend, how did you enter here without wearing a wedding dress?" The man had nothing to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made plans to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't let others tell you what to do or say. You don't care about their status or importance."
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. Bring him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They answered, "Caesar." Then he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished. They left him and went away. The dead do not marry.
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe in the resurrection of the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.'"
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. It repeated until it reached the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, whose wife will you be? All seven of them were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the dead who rise? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The Great Commandment
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been unable to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
He said to him, "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." - Who is the son of Mary?
The Pharisees gathered together. And Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit himself speaks through David." David himself said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
So if David calls him "Lord," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
Therefore, you must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not willing to lift a single finger to move them.
All they do is for others to see. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes of their coats very long.
They love to sit in places of honor at feasts. They also love to take the first seats in the synagogues.
They like to be addressed as "Rabbi" when greeted in the markets.
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The greatest among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
(No
What a misfortune for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel everywhere to gain one person to your faith. Then you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
What a misfortune for you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the temple that worships gold?
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.'
O ye blind men! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Everyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And everyone who swears in the temple of God, swears by God and by Him who dwells in Him.
And everyone who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
What a misfortune for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You tithe mint and dill and cumin, and all the herbs, and have neglected justice and mercy and faith. These you should have done, without neglecting the others.
O you blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
What a misfortune for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, and then the outside will also be clean.
What a misfortune for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
It's the same with you. You seem fine on the outside, like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of what's wrong. You're pretending to be something you're not.
What misfortune you have brought upon yourselves, you hypocritical Pharisees and teachers of the law! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
She says, 'If we had lived in the times of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets.'
You bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of a people who killed the prophets.
Will you then make up for the deficiency in those who came before you?
O nest of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to the fire?
Therefore, I will send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them and crucify others and scourge them in your synagogues and chase them from town to town.
Therefore you shall pay the price for the blood of all the righteous that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples followed him and pointed out the temple buildings.
Jesus asked, "Do you see all these things?" "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be careful! Beware of being deceived.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about wars in the future. Do not be disturbed. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
At that time, many will fall away from their faith. They will hate each other and hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For the abundance of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). You will see it one day standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their home to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
How terrible those days will be for pregnant women! How terrible they will be for nursing mothers!
Pray you don't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than anything since the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If the days were not shortened, no one would be saved. But for the sake of God's chosen people, they will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders, and they will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations on earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. They will gather the chosen ones from the four directions. They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches soften and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It is at the door.
What I am about to tell you is true. People living at that time will not die until all these things happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour."
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They had no idea what would happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Six women are grinding at a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
So be on your guard; you do not know the day on which your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew when the thief would come at night. Then he would make sure to watch. He wouldn't allow his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
A master is supposed to put one of his servants over the rest in his house. The servant's task is to feed them on time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this task.
It would be good for the servant if his master found him doing his work upon his return.
I am about to tell you the truth. The master will make that servant responsible for all that he owns.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master is a long time in coming.'
It is assumed that he starts beating other servants. It is assumed that he eats and drinks with those who drink excessively.
The master of that servant will return on a day when the servant does not expect him. And he will return at an hour when the servant does not know.
Then Mr. will tear it to pieces. He will send it to the place where the litigants go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. And five were wise.
The fools took their lamps but brought no olive oil with them.
The wise men carried the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So, all the bridesmaids felt tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the bridesmaids woke up and took their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out.'
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The bridesmaids, who were ready, entered with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut.
Later, the other bridesmaids also came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I'm telling you is true. I don't know you."
Stay awake. You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The Parable of the Three Servants
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a king, which went to travel into a far country, and called his servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
The man gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. Then he gave $2,000 to the third. He gave each servant the amount he knew they could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went and invested his money. He made an additional ten thousand dollars.
The man with four thousand dollars got an additional four thousand dollars.
But the man who received the two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who was entrusted with ten thousand dollars came with the other ten thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with ten thousand dollars. Look, I have made another ten thousand dollars."
His lord answered and said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Come and enjoy the joy of your lord!"
The man who had four thousand dinars also came and said, "Master, you entrusted me with four thousand dinars, and here I have made four thousand dinars more."
His lord answered and said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Come and enjoy the joy of your lord!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand dollars came. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
That's why I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2,000 in the ground. Look, this is what's yours.
The master replied, "You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have gotten it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take the thousand from him and give it to the one who has ten thousand."
To those who have more will be given, and they will have in abundance. But as for those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken from them.
"Throw this vile servant out. Out there in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth." The sheep and the camels.
The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world."
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me into your home.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? And when did we see you in need of clothes and clothe you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The King will answer and say to them, “Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me.”
Then he will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.”
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me into your home. I needed clothes. But you gave me none of yours. I was sick and in prison. But you did not care for me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? And when did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick or in prison and come to You?'
He will reply, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Anything you have not done for one of these little ones, you have not done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous will receive eternal life.
The plot to kill Jesus.
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
The chief priests met with the elders of the people. They gathered in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They plotted to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up a riot." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they were angry. "What a waste!" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
There will always be poor people in the world. But I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare myself for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be spoken of in remembrance of him." Judas agreed to hand Jesus over.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said to them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He told them, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The pupils were very sad. Each of them began to say to him, "I am not myself, Lord, am I?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "Is it I, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for the forgiveness of sins for many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night you are all going to fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Everyone might leave because of you. But I never will."
Jesus answered, "Verily I say unto thee, Before the cock crow this day, thou shalt deny me thrice."
Peter said, "I may die with you, but I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to be sorrowful and very distressed.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me. Yet, not what I will, but what you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Be careful and pray. This way you won't fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again, and a third time he prayed with the same words.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Rise up! Let us go! Here is the one who delivers me to them!" The arrest of Jesus.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, agreed with them on a sign. "Whomever I kiss," he said, "that is the man. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward. They seized Jesus and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword. He drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how do the written prophecies come true then? They say it has to happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I a bandit chief to fight you with swords and clubs?" He wondered, "Did you have to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I have been sitting in the temple courtyard every day teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was brought before the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
He did not go far, he followed Jesus. He went straight to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said, "Yes. Just as you said." Then he added, "But let me tell you all. In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have all heard his evil words."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They punched him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But before them all, Peter said that wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't him. He swore, "I don't know that man!"
A little later, those who stood by came up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; even your speech gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake, I released an innocent man." They replied, "What do we care? That's your problem."
Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, "It is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the murder of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah, which he spake, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value."
"They paid the potter the thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9)
Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a famous prisoner called Barabbas.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate learned that the leaders were jealous. He realized that this was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that man, for I have suffered much in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
The governor asked, "Which one do you want me to release?" They answered, "Barabbas."
Pilate asked, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify Him!"
"Why? What is his crime?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Seeing that he was making no progress, Pilate instead began to appeal to the crowd. He took water and washed his hands before them, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. You are responsible!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium, and all the other soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him on the cross. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there and guarded him.
And they put on his head his accusation written: "This is Jesus the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by Jesus mocked him and shook their heads.
And they said, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
The chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders also mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now if he wants him, for he said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying: "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus cry out, and said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks split.
The graves were opened. And many of the sleeping rose, who had repented of their sins.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified. They cried out, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
It was not very far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to provide for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. There was also Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
In the evening, a rich man from Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. So Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Sir, we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
Therefore give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, in case his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead.' That last deception will be worse than the first.
Pilate answered, "Take soldiers with you. Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rose from the dead.
Now when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other went to examine the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
The women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were walking, some guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll bribe him. That will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders to Jesus for his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. Yet some still had their doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am with you always."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, saying: "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a road for our God."
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people from the region of Judea and also all the people from Jerusalem were going out to him. And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John the Baptist baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice called out to him from heaven, "You are my beloved Son, and I am pleased with you."
Immediately, the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
Jesus spent forty days in the desert, where he was tempted by the devil. Wild beasts did not harm him, and angels attended to his needs. He chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled," "the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me." "I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further ahead. There he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending their nets.
And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. And he cast out a spirit, an unclean spirit, from a man.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were astonished at his teaching. He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
At that moment, a man in their assembly, who was possessed by an evil spirit, shouted out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One, the Holy One of God!"
Jesus said sternly, "Be quiet!" "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands evil spirits and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately, they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt before him and pleaded, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." "Be 'clean'!"
Immediately, the disease left him. He was healed.
Jesus rebuked him immediately. He sternly warned the man.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this. Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely; and news of him spread abroad throughout the whole region. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but stayed outside in secluded places. And people fro
Jesus healing a man who cannot walk
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room. There wasn't even room outside the door. Jesus was teaching the word to them.
Four of the arrivals were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
"Why is this man speaking this way? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins!"
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were discussing among themselves what they would do. He said to
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
He said to her, "I say to you, rise, take up your mat, and go home."
The man rose and took up his mat. Then he walked away, while all were watching him. They were all astounded, and they glorified God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
Once again, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
Some of the Pharisees, who were teachers of the law, were sitting there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors, and they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but yours do not. Why?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as he is with them.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not patch a new piece of cloth onto an old garment. If they do, the new piece will tear away from the old one. This will make the tear worse.

On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. And the disciples began to pluck the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this work on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He answered, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
It was at the time when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
One Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered hand. He said to him, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what should be done on the Sabbath? Does it command good or evil? Does it save life or destroy it?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around in anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hardened. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Then the Pharisees went and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, wanting to kill him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. Large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Jesus ordered his disciples, because of the crowd, to prepare a small boat for him. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick were jostling to touch him.
When the people who had evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"

Jesus appointed twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were Jacob son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus called them Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. There were also Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them also. It was he who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. A crowd gathered again. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. So they went to take charge. They said, "He's lost his mind."
Some of the scribes were there, who had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons."
Jesus called his disciples and told them stories. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it will not stand.
If the family breaks up, it won't last.
