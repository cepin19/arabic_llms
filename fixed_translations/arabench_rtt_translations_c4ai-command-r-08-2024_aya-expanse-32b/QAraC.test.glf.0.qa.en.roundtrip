And I won't interfere. I'll take what's mine, and you also have the right to take before me.

And I found a big surprise.
The feast is no one's right.
Say it to yourself.
This holiday won't come around again in our lifetime.
Don't be a stranger, okay! Saleh.
Seize the opportunity from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it that way.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone benefits.
This is the rule!
Even those who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
Phase One of the Third Millennium International Beaches Infrastructure
You fool!
This is the place where we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You have no right to exploit her.
When his car wouldn't start
Who used to drive him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
What would give you the money to refuel your car four or five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't act stupid and be stubborn.
Take advantage
See Uncle Khamees
And now, as they say, he's called a millionaire.
A third of the project
The other third is a commission.
Who plays in a popular band,
They say there was a national celebration.
And I bought a hundred lanterns.
Do you know what they did?
I added the zero.
No use, oh Auntie!
No, God guides him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
This is an opportunity.
Let good triumph.
And if God wills, good will prevail.
This is normal.
Keep it between us.
Don't tell anyone about this matter.
Do we need to be afraid?
Just my friends
Headache.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
Good morning for two hours.
He began to be convinced.
We'll meet him in a bit.
And we need to convince him.
It is he who provides us with benefits.
Really, let him change his mind at the meeting.
Oh Brother Ali, Oh Brother Osman.
I don't know.
Today is my first day back at work.
"Upon me let reliance be placed."
How come you don't understand!
Sure. But are you sure I'll see some?
I want to ask you.
If you're hungry and walking down the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a human who eats a lot.
Don't be afraid.
The plate is large.
We're still working on the draft for the meeting.
If you're not okay,
If you have any inquiries
What exactly do I want to know?
It's permissible.
May God guide you, Saleh!
This is reasonable because you're a boss for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We'll join our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
No one should suspect what we're doing.
Let's put our share in a separate article!
My money was stolen.
By the project officials.
It's not possible.
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
You just seem afraid of something.
This is their right.
First of all,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said it!
Let's say it's her friend's car.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear this talk from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
God bless you.
He has the money now.
Now he will take me with him.
Are we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we taking anything?
In the end, we get nothing!
He wants to eat it all by himself, the glutton.
Don't shake your head!
You are not your brother.
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked with him all night.
I told him that, whatever the case, they are your relatives.
He agreed in the end.
This is what's supposed to happen.
God willing, only good will happen.
This is the third international millennium beach.
Our infrastructure, specifically, needs improvement.
Then they start the second phase.
And it continues with him.
May Allah reward you with good.
Good that you made him agree.
You're no different from them.
Okay, never mind.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said even after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to determine the project budget.
They need to follow up, it's their money.
We placed it and are certain.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my partner from the man involved with me.
Do you mean that it is he?
We are responsible for doors, windows, and all aspects of finishes.
Fine, fine.
How much do you want to finish?
How much will it cost?
This is how we take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And we'll determine the amount we'll receive.
Some people wait and want each other.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decided to take half a million,
This week, everyone is thinking well.
They sell it for a fixed amount.
By next week, they will decide and determine how much they want.
Mind your own business.
Then, it's up to you.
Ignore him.
Hello friend, what's up? What's going on?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Whoa! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Salih, your brother's name is Sultan!
This is our neighbors' driver.
Sometimes we drive our car when it doesn't work.
Write.
Abdullah's slave
No, no, there are still three more people.
What else can I do, I'm tired of him.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and be done."
No, no, that's going to cost an arm and a leg.
How much should I give him?
Poor thing, does he have kids?
Yes, he has it. It's twenty-five thousand and four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much are you giving them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, as we were just talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, this is the last one! Ah, my son!
No, my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's up?
Why are you angry?
But from the first phase, the infrastructure in particular.
What is used?
Add three thousand.
Buy me a glittery sequined watch from Thailand.
Did you supply her?
Yes, Mom.
Mom, I added her, I just wanted to confirm the name.
My love, Mama
Eid al-Adha
The budget really needs to be set; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone must specify the amount they want.
I have
Is a million enough!
Very much, my dear.
Guys, guys, wait, there's a commotion, give us a chance.
The committee is in session now to adopt the project budget; financial matters should not be discussed now, that's all.
My father is tall.
We told you not to embarrass us, we're in the ministry's courtyard.
Yay, we're screaming, don't draw attention to us.
If someone comes and asks, "What are all of you doing here?"
We tell him that the electricity is out or broken.
Don't make a scene in the ministry's courtyard.
%pw Silent %pw Silent
Thread it! Do you hear me?
How much have you spent so far?
Without counting my brother
Totally, 50 million %pw
Fifty million only for the first phase.
How much is it now?
What, Saleh?
Sharing is giving, man!
In any case, bon appétit.
Hurry up, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The most important thing is that we don't want any discussions, we just want them to agree on the budget.
Start execution with Ajra.
And provides services to a large sector of the community.
God bless you, this is the Third Millennium Beaches International Project.
This is the first stage.
Infrastructure
For future generations
Certainly, on behalf of our team, I would like to greet and congratulate you on the inauguration of the project, which will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
What we got used to - a year and a half.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
The oil blessing keeps good on us.
Second, third, and tenth stage.

Welcome aboard the flight.
Why are you gathering us here? When will the cars arrive to pick us up?
What? Where are they taking us?
Alhamdulillah, I've grown up and become a sheep.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, she's a good girl.
But I don't see anything.
Nothing but the sea.
Why did they isolate you?
Iman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
She wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
What is that land?
I saw a farm in the desert and said, "This must be your father's."
Moreover, why are you asking about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Those who work hard and invest in land, real estate, businesses, and make an effort.
Free from headaches.
I'm disappointed in you, Iman!
And so, my sister.
Why don't you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
Nothing is better than honesty.
"Because of the money."
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting her brothers in court.
Nine years, ten years, or more.
No, thanks.
The brothers of Umm Sulayman are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that
Do you want to build a mosque before you die?
You don't know.
I don't say that I am your brother like her brothers, God willing, no.
How many years have passed since my father's death?
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Is the check paid every three months?
Oh, Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
What's on her is...
If it were someone else, they wouldn't see his sisters as real.
I got it.
Where from?
It's like my money.
See what, Munira
See him.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I was brave and asked about my father's land, which is in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than this.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What can I say, oh Munira!
I won't stop fighting for my rights.
I'll take my rights.
It's best to invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
There's no mercy among people these days.
Don't think your brothers are better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't get anything out of it.
Why do they do that?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear, be nice to them.
Treat them kindly.
And you get bored of them.
Why do courts take so long?
We are all four hundred thousand.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I doubt, oh! my dear, that an order will be issued.
Look at my brothers.
I swear to God, I don't want all this.
What should I do, oh God!
I can only say that God is sufficient for us, and He is the best manager of our affairs.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of our affairs.
Didn't you have a court session last week?
As usual, oh dear!
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've gone through this topic many times.
My love, they will invest millions, and you will just watch.
And as I told you, you get bored of courts.
And I won't take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'm satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
The men want you!
She has a little bit.
Just a few questions about her class and
I just want to know something and then leave.
If ever you find
"I'll take you and show you."
He'll find his way.
I signed the waiver.
One hundred and fifty is enough, and more, her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why are you asking now?
But he is greedy.
It's not my right.
This is my father's inheritance, and he will decide how much I should take. I'll take it or leave it.
It's neither my responsibility nor his. It's up to us to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
This money is what's keeping us like this.
Opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, oh Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they take.
Even the company,
You have the right to go and ask about everything.
And I won't leave them alone.
How are you going to respond to them?
Mind your own business.
And what's it to you, I have a right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him a power of attorney.
Have him check everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He's scaring us.
Falcon, enough.
My brother Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Walk, now.
Excuse me, walk.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he went and sued us,
He said that she had defeated him.
Let him do what he wants!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to inspect everything.
If he saw the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If you examine the budget,
Twelve times eight
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is as much as we owe her.
Exclusion of lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, we are not afraid.
If not, that's what we have, and if he agrees, welcome.
Let them go and face it.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
Then you have someone to rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what was supposed to happen from the beginning.
Yes, father.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
Oh, Brother Rashid, it should have happened before.
As you wish, my lord.
File by file
When she knew her true heritage,
Villas and lands you didn't know about them.
They came out seven.
They came out sixteen.
She didn't know.
Fakira was shocked.
There is no more justice.
Don't leave them alone.
Oh my son, God guide you, I don't want to hear about courts.
The more anxious you become,
The little judge
For half a minute
Then he says his usual sentence.
For the seventh, the fourth, two thousand, I don't know how much.
They will be very happy, my son.
You should never get out of bed, Mom!
May God heal you.
No, no, please come in.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we locked the door and threw him out of the company.
One of my schoolmates sends.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
God willing, it will happen.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts only produce reports.
Delays and battles, useless lawyers.
Years pass.
And the years pass by.
And we won't give you a real.
God bless Umm Salama's mother.
You advised me the day before she died.
Never go to court.
He said that our courts
She died without taking anything from her inheritance.
She died and the judge still hasn't resolved her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello, Abdullah.
My brother Abdullah
Years passed.
This is my brother Saad.
Accepted into the mercy of God.
The most important thing
Brotherhood
My brother Rashid
You are my brother.
Don't let money problems
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Excuse me.
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
It's true.
They don't want me to take my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that Saad's wife, my brother-in-law's wife, had given birth to a beautiful baby girl.
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We're trying one last time.
Send them your friend, Abdullah.
They neither respected him nor even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdurrahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
Surely Nasser said.
Don't be afraid.
Intimidating them with the law
Did you forget the words of the poor woman, Umm Salmin, about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Umm Sulaym do not fear the courts.
But my brothers
He might be afraid of rumors.
They might be embarrassed to go to court.
We'll wait and see what happens after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit.
May God help you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
How do you say, "Oh my, my child"?
It is he who speaks the truth.
Go away, %pw go
Going to court tomorrow morning.
Why do I have to postpone until the day after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What happens if I wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid.
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Scare them with the law.
Now, he's begging me to postpone his court appearance.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Either you asked me what this is, or this is it.
May God bless you all.
Small Courts Building
"May God bless you"
And all of you
May God protect you.
What did I say?
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until after tomorrow.
To obtain this sample of the courthouse building
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through this door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
Put all your things over there.
Phone and anything metal so it doesn't make a beep beep beep beep beep sound.
Register the case, they will ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight elevator go.
Look for the offices.
Look at the judge, if you need a specific judge, for example.
Also, these.
Are you going to sue us?
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your revenge.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
I'm having dinner at my sister's house tonight.
Where, has the ministry approved his project?
My sister said he was very, very happy, he couldn't believe it.
He said, "If they agree on the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house."
Alhamdulillah, luck always comes in pairs.
Oh, happiness to you, Father of Waleed!
Lucky he is.
My sister said he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Ah! Manal
What is known as business, but good men helped him.
Okay, tell your father.
God willing, you liked the food.
Thank you, Abu Waleed.
Thank you, Abu Waleed, may God bless you.
May God fill your life with abundance.
"This food is very delicious, Um Waleed."
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me just rent an office, and they'll do everything else.
Please, my uncle.
Oh my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We need a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you'd give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Abu Waleed.
Excuse me.
A thousand congratulations, Abu Waleed!
You deserve it.
Look, frankly, you don't have experience in trade and business.
Wow! There's a story behind this project.
"How are you?"
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
What I know about it now
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, which our ministry is looking for. Submit the request to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
What understands
What is a contractor?
The Japanese are awesome.
When you open it, the computer says: Computer, computer, computer, computer.
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, press kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid a little.
Insurance amount
Above all, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place my first order.
What do you want?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Would you like to drink tea?
"O Walid, tell me, what have you done!"
You don't know Bou Fahd, he might come, and he might not.
He will suddenly appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
"Come on, let's go"
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Abu Fahd's signature.
Ha! What should I do?
May God help you.
The minutes are five to two, Abu Waleed.
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
May God help you, come tomorrow.
I said that you know the manager from a long time ago and he is your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He's a useless manager.
A weird manager, doesn't do anything.
It's a shame they act wise in places that don't deserve respect.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they amount to anything? Never!
They wouldn't move a chair without Bu Fahad's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's problems are hanging.
It seems he's going to them today.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
The factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing, it won't happen.
And if they ask about you
It's not only you who's waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please sit down.
Walk slowly.
I'll talk to you when he comes.
If something happens, you'll call, don't scare them.
Goodbye
Sorry, I scared you. This is my wife.
Wow! They've approved my two-month-old request.
I just need his signature, what's this?
Oh my son, this is the registration period. My daughter will lose her university scholarship if her papers are not organized.
My problem with the factory is the duration, the duration.
Just wait.
All your papers are going to fall.
He's drinking his coffee. When he's done, you can come and see him.
Please, I'm asking all of you to be quiet.
Yes, my father.
Goodbye
Wait, wait ah! Oh people
Wait, where are you going, wait.
Did you know what happened first?
What's happening?
He has an urgent trip.
We have a private exit.
I'm tired of this job.
Our wish was cut off, brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What can we do? We wait for Abu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, Papa
He can't be blamed.
Everything is breaking down.
Japan's factory
I informed him that the deadline had passed.
And your aunt is another story.
Poor thing, she gave him money.
Everyone around him causes him problems.
Oh my god, I'm so worried about my father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who will you call?
Yes, who's calling?
Bu Waleed
He talks about the factory and your wife's sister's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Oh father, until when will you make me wait?
They always say,
And we're waiting for Abu Fahd.
Oh boy, I'm tired and have worked hard!
But all my friends are going to university next week.
What do you want?
The phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Okay, who are you talking to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You were very patient with us.
May God help you.
Bu Waleed is in a pitiful state.
He shivers like a leaf from the fever.
This is because there's still a little time left.
There are five days left.
He spends all his money.
God protect us.
Oh, how sweet! He pulls me, he pulls me, he pulls me.
I wish I could improve. I feel...
I have a strange fever.
The top is shaking.
The second text is completely static.
Half of my body isn't working due to the fever.
This is a discount.
Don't be afraid.
Things will be fine.
My sister helps.
You're waiting until we pay her back.
May God reward her well.
We're worried about your sister now.
Oh God, help me.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what he's doing.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
It drags me, it's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth is being wasted.
Don't pull us.
Inside the brain, in the brain.
# How can you speak?
Give me, let's see who's calling.
Bu Waleed
I'm calling you because I feel you.
Get ready to wait.
Goodbye
I have been a committed person all my life.
You were a role model.
Don't think I don't know about you leaving work early every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What's wrong with your phone?
Instead of deducting from you.
I'll put you on the stock committee.
Are you going to the store with them today?
You leave work during working hours?
If I do
Then don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him looking puzzled, holding his phone waiting for their call?
I'm afraid they'll fire him.
This is my phone, Abu Waleed!
He is poor.
Let him go, God help him.
Ah! The smell of Walid.
Yes, hello
Get well soon, Abu Waleed! I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Finish your paper.
Don't be afraid.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What's up with you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
This office is the third one on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Don't you want to?
House by house
Walk ahead.
Guys, this man is crazy!
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you
He took the papers and returned them.
My knees are starting to give way.
Shuttling back and forth between all these ministries
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back like potato chips for kids.
Then, God willing, I learned how to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They always pass me when I ride this motorcycle, oh my god!
This is our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager arrived.
We should celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
I mean, are you quitting your job?
I testify that you are a true citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother, see you later.
We are all at your service.
Don't you want us to extend it for you by one year?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You've already given me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children are employed now.
The one before him, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz,
My father wants to rest.
And you're just a delivery driver.
With a street vendor
Do you believe that
I haven't eaten ham in four years.
Her taste is sweet.
I smell it now.
We'll do everything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the papers?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers are delayed.
I'm boring.
Complete
Get in touch with me.
Oh my son, Khalid
From now on,
"Insha'Allah I'll rest, %pw yay" Note:
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, my boy.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he couldn't get out of work.
What are you doing?
I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He goes back to work every day.
I'm sure he feels bored.
This is good for him.
Do you let him rest?
Good grief, he's happy that he's getting home early.
He knocked and said, "Khaled."
I told him to complete his papers.
I fear God.
Everyone should rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the divorce.
Oh, Mom, it won't break.
I am not sorry, O street vendor, Oh! my daughter,
But I say from the day he left the job and left.
And Khalid gave him tasks to do.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those Lost at Sea (Singing)
Good morning, father.
Hello, my daughter
Daddy, please.
But they called me and said the manager is angry.
Bring your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the kids be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Poor thing.
I'm waiting for you, with the bride's veil in front of me.
We'll eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, dear father.
May God help you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I have left, oh! my daughter, I have left.
O God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
God willing.
It's good that you found the house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children fend for themselves.
What are you doing, Umm Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, rest.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
And the innocent one eats it.
Poor thing, you look so tired.
And from the taxis
He is naive.
The branch in the market is closed.
And they want to know her identity.
I didn't even take her car.
And he gave him the papers.
Alhamdulillah, I'm better now.
Believe in yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch was very delicious.
I was moving from ministry to ministry.
I run from ministry to ministry.

See you later, goodbye.
Sorry now, ah! ah! Father Shahin
They called me and said it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
So, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
What's the point, especially tomorrow, I can't.
He loves you.
Although he is annoyed and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is tired and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to circling the streets under the hot sun.
Make him give you the papers.
Go now and finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until noon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want to delay the construction of my building?
Since you have an appointment and a committee tomorrow.
Your papers need to be finished tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he needs to be present.
What's wrong with you, sir?
Holding back his tears
I indeed didn't lie to my parents.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they'll come this weekend.
Why didn't you tell him?
Oh dad, don't go!
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with these girls.
You cheated him.
Enough, that's enough.
I'm going to apologize.
I'm making it for you.
Thank you
Oh, my boy, Khaled.
He is wrong.
I'm selfish too.
When he found out the committee wasn't coming.
We are blessed by you.
And from now on, my boy!
We'll do our personal things by ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
He deserves the world.
I don't want to upset you.
What's wrong?
As I told you,
After you finish the paper.
I was going to do it myself.
And he asked me to come quickly.
I also have a meeting.
With the happiness of the minister
From my eyes.
Meet important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with him.
Don't be afraid and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Abu Saeed?
Please, Daddy,
The envelope is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Pass by my place, I'll send her with the tea boy.
My dear father
Do you mean that he didn't sign?
He might have forgotten.
Because the committee meets in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My father has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week off and goes to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes out early in the morning.
He enjoys himself there immensely.
And imagine what
They say he's a good cook.
And we go to him.
Goodbye
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him, uncle?
God guides you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, nothing's wrong.
Your papers are scattered.
He is on the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers
I'm thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
My father confuses them.
Thank you, sister.
You're right.
No, no, no, I told him.
Honest, my sister.
Excuse me, sister.
They call it my league and cup.
He reported from the match referee.
He started talking nonsense.
And they named it with a playful name, which is the cessation of corruption.
People began to incite him.
He fed him some nonsense to say on television and radio.
And then
They put him in prison.
Believe it or not, sister,
These days, everyone only thinks about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never ever start.
Let him speak, and repeat his famous phrase: "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your presence.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, mom.
Listen to me, my son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Present, Mother.
I will never call.
Radio or TV, and I won't call to kill.
Your sister, Aisha, was
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
Have mercy on us, O Lord.
As I said.
Hero clown
Because I don't want to upset you.
Your uncle, Abu Manira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said, "Case closed."
Cancelled
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he'll drag you to court to divorce his daughter.
Okay, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I won't.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I'm telling you, just lower your voice.
The manager told me that
You shouldn't work here.
Because you can talk about management.
And let's not get hurt.
How will the manager justify this decision?
He has a million excuses to say.
Where am I going!
Are you kidding? Resign.
What did I tell you before?
Hello, Ay!
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, because of public interest.
It is necessary to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, say it just once: "Stop corruption."
Sweet
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work.
This is a disaster.
Until this case is solved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they'd fire him.
And Mona is standing here and heard me say this.
Yes, my boy, you did.
I heard them with my own ears say these words.
Go ahead, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he quit the job.
Just because we're relatives,
Do you hear that sound?
Calm down.
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
May God guide you to the right path.
I came to drink coffee.
I know you.
I feel bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to God, I'll take you to court by force to get his daughter divorced.
Even if I leave
Why do you want to get yourself into trouble?
Just be careful.
Even if someone asks you
Ignore him.
Is he a corruption fighter?
Hey guys, what's up?
Zain seems to be eating well these days.
We want to hear it, even just once, please let us hear it.
No, it's fine.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mom, you didn't understand.
I asked him on a radio show about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in front of people.
I suggested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
Go far away.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be angry and won't talk to you at all, you hear?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've gotten rid of this habit, praise be to God.
You have a strong sense of responsibility.
Ideal employee
But unfortunately,
And I tried
Peace be upon you
You came, but you didn't need to.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shehan, what's wrong with you?
What you know
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh and his corruption?
Are you Saleh, known as "the Stopper of Corruption"?
Stop corruption.
Ah, the job.
There are no open positions, you know.
You did a great job.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I went everywhere, Manira.
Even one of them told me that five minutes before I arrived, there was a vacancy, but they rented it out, I mean, they gave it to someone else.
My sister, Aisha, broke up yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
He spoils the minister.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this guy is going to take my place.
Enough, stop.
Who said I would be silent?
I just want it to be done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
Finish him off.
But how?
I know him.
Is this the one who talks nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring it to your house.
And just give him the information.
You are a loyal and patriotic human being.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I've left her for good.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Oh, Father Fahd, I spoke to him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard his voice calling for an end to corruption."
He wanted to see you.
This is normal, Saleh.
I am diligent in the tent.
Advance, advance, advance
You are very special
Upon your wonderful words
Your voice on the radio is sweeter.
We hear about stopping corruption all the time.
Yes, please, just one, they say it's Bou Fahad, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want to stop.
I can't.
And then I'll leave.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Let us be good.
I'll leave you with one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, true.
This is your chance.
Opportunity doesn't knock twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't you understand?
Wait, brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
The dark-colored bear carries a amount of poison equal to 20 cm of pressure.
Only this employee
Approving the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Saleh, stand against corruption.
No, God bless you.
This request is private.
I hope you hear him.
The last stop for corruption.. Stop corruption.
You know.
He had to do it out of dire need.
This is the last one.
Deposed Sultan
The minister dismissed him immediately.
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bu Fahad can do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Your Excellency.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was the last one, for sure. I won't do it again.
And this is the job application, sorry, I was just kidding.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he's afraid one day
And expose his evil deeds.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They are afraid of you.
They cheated me, my sister Aisha.
You're kind.
Your uncle, Abu Manira
I'm sure I'll find a job.
People who criticize are idiots.
They are envious, they hate our country.
Do we have any problem?
We don't have any connections.
I've never heard that word before.
In our government circles,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a national? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem is which family you're from; we never have such problems.
If the manager or supervisor is annoyed with you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
No problems.
Thank you.
Did you listen to the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No sweetness until evening.
I mean, no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
When we were playing, Adel and I
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
May God protect you, Adoul.
Come see what your mischievous nephew did.
I told you it was expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said it's fine, it will look good on Waleed.
See what he did.
The shirt isn't worn now.
This is why he's not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
See how he intended to tear it, it's clear it was a deliberate attempt.
Poor Waleed
He was happy wearing the T-shirt for the first time.
We'll see.
Where is the bathroom?
In the garden.
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Have some shame.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be allowed to do as he pleases.
He is still rebellious.
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a repairman?
We raise them.
Make yourself comfortable.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like kids?
Stay away from this, mother.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
He is a boy.
You can't distinguish between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
You know.
There's no fault in you.
Let's go up.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
What should be
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm coming. God be with you, goodbye.
Alright, sir, there are some papers you need to sign, the minister wants to see them.
Alright, alright, I'll talk to the minister, don't bother yourself.
I saw the disaster, the catastrophe?
This is new, oh wow! Aisha
This is not a childish act.
You're right.
Destroyed the clothes.
Look, look
This is what is worn.
Look at Adol's pants; one leg can be worn, while the other is exposed.
It's clear that it wasn't torn by hands.
It appears to be cut with a power saw.
I can only say, "May Allah protect us."
I'm telling you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I still know
If you know, take a turn around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike.
Also because of something else
Telling the truth is right.
Okay, do you want candy?
Yes, my father is two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors that can even cut a car.
Under the bed, take all the sweets.
No, not to that extent.
No one else can do something like that.
Why do we have to be quiet?
The most important thing
This is what we insist on.
Who tore his clothes, a newborn child.
What is a computer?
What is he talking about?
It's impossible for a child to make these cracks.
Why don't you believe me?
Go find your friends.
Give me another one.
Always like this.
Fighting every day, oh! My son.
The days that have passed
"I seek forgiveness from Allah and ask for wellness."
God guides you.
Who can hold scissors this size?
Go find some friends.
He's a liar, mom.
He went and brought this big pair of scissors.
Greet your spirit, Sultan, wow.
Come and find a solution to this, come my son!
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and make up with each other.
Okay, tell me, what are you doing now?
Normal, they tore their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information; he ruined everything.
I won't leave him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, like that used in museums.
Ignore him.
The pawn knocked and knocked until it got tired and left.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And I waved goodbye.
He is filled with hatred and jealousy.
He's crazy because I broke the computer.
Ah, Fahd.
Solan, hit him, hit, hit.
Fear God, my children!
Hit him, hit him, [be quiet] pay attention, [be quiet]
Take your cousins, and play with them outside.
God guides you.
May God protect you
Old men
What did you leave for the kids?
Okay, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Perhaps for the last time, oh! my son
You know he's the older brother, ah! Girls
He knows how to talk to people.
And he protested.
Don't be angry with me.
You should
Play a role
God guides you.
Even you, you've become like them, oh my poor son!
Mother, they hit my son, this is a conspiracy against us, and you're saying "let it go," stay away.
Go away.
There's blood coming from my son.
You're embarrassing us, you guys!
It was the kids who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him our children, he doesn't believe us.
"He said from his window."
He saw children throwing stones and, because he was far away, he thought they were adults.
I'm crazy.
You can go.
You can be tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing stones.
It seems
Ohhhhhhhh
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed a promise. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, oh Allah
Allah suffices against the enemy.
Oh my God, mother!
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, they just act like children, their minds are sick.
Take me to the hospital, I'm fainting, I'm dying.
Yes, and what was the first time I saw it?
And I saw that he never took his eyes off you.
I'm enrolled in the business class.
But he has been coming with us for a week.
Clearly, he knows you.
Don't hold back, since he likes you this much.
No, my sister.
I don't want my father to think I'm easy.
I followed him.
Let's keep it simple.
Now he's running after you, he knows you well.
It's true that I still love him.
No, I don't feel it's the right time.
100%
She looks at you and *
You wait for her to come and say: "Excuse me, may I get to know you?"
Take the initiative.
You're right.
But I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What do you want? Are you enrolled in the same class as her?
What did the teacher say?
He asked her, "Please, miss."
Where, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But we get to know each other.
You are very big.
You have to go and say, "Excuse me,
Can I get to know you?
Not to this extent.
I need to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and well-mannered girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yeah, right.
Never forget us.
As long as I'm free.
He buys the villa behind our villa for his parents.
He's getting married tomorrow, he doesn't live far from us.
There's no use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And it was purchased through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God blesses them in their home.
Hello, my child, good morning.
Uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you with good.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is running now, come on, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
What do you want?
Neighbors talk to each other, what do you want?
It's better for you to stay away from us.
The neighbors are talking to each other, you're the odd one out.
A respectful man parked his car behind mine, I can't get it out.
I mean, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll keep you in this Titanic mood.
See you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know you're Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely when they hear your father's name, many people will say you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
Indeed, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the well-known actor, is your father?
Eat cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Hey, right.
My friend at university, I know them, they told me this.
He loves acting and only watches his own works.
He finally said, "We're living next to someone famous and valuable in the community."
My heart, what a happiness
He's quite cute, he has a sense of humor.
His son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
It was said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Oh mother, speak to my cousin Aboud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they're making a series about diving.
You're lucky, he brought you a sheep, a gift for the new villa.
It's proven that he's a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
Indeed, we have many names.
They told me, Abu Saad, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
It is determined according to the staff's needs and experience.
What we know
We might not transfer you.
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God blesses us and brings money, we'll buy furniture.
I straightened the paper.
Ah! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors to each other
But now I heard and saw.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Don't be afraid, my sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan. If approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We are now like one family.
Can your sister study without your help?
I just want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say he's my friend?
Oh, my son, Ali!
I don't have any problem with that.
As long as you love me and I love you, I'll solve the problem.
I dreamed of you.
Let me suggest your cousin to you.
Leave it to me.
As you like it.
They will stop you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
What's wrong with Bouali?
Oh brother! The car broke down.
From time to time, this worries me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
My car is always breaking down.
We're having a baby girl.
What's on him.
You don't need to exhaust yourself, my brother Rashid!
No, God bless you.
A car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the development bank bought you a house and a car.
Is this our car?
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see relationships evolving.
Discussing matters of mutual interest to both parties.
Wow, this is a huge development.
Come on!
Mom, this is embarrassing.
I agreed.
She said: "Nora is like my daughter, and the driver takes her to university every day."
Did you tell her that my father's car will be in maintenance for a week?
I swear to God, no.
She said he picks her up every morning.
Witness, O Lord, O Mother of Ali!
They are good people.
No, no, no! Oh man!
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
What a disaster, what a disaster, what am I now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who will take my daughter to university?
Ah! Bou Ali, since you're recommended by Mr. Rashid Abdullah.
We can't refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Bu Saad.
We all know how much we love Bouali.
Thank you, may God reward you, ah! O Abu Saad!
They love you, God willing.
This is sweet.
Guys, Professor Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem.
You're lucky, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers, care about us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, and I'll get it for you.
What's happening? What's wrong? Why are you pulling me?
Are you offering me a mango?
Agree, Mother, agree.
Manal told her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
More dresses, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
You'll be raised in luxury soon, Waleed, my joy.
She called me, God help her.
Take some accessories.
Buy accessories! Jewelry
Is this my mother?
You drive a fancy car, too.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I can't look at you.
This is from your kindness, Umm Waleed.
In addition to all this, she gave you the car.
With the driver.
If I went along with you like this, they wouldn't believe that this feeble man is the husband of the queen.
Oh God
Are you going to go in that outfit?
What! No, no, no, no, no, don't be afraid.
Without my shape, you won't recognize me.
They're surprised when they find out I'm a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may God prolong his life.
Bu Ali, frankly, I didn't recognize you. I thought you were an important person, but you're not Bu Ali. You're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
You even walk differently.
God will provide for you, the people we intend to advance for Ali, may He be exalted.
Important
I've arranged everything from the car's hood to its trunk.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the latest series you acted in.
There was a show, as I remember, a wedding.
I was wearing shiny black shoes.
And I, after my father, am learning how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I've never worn a bisht in my life.
Inshallah, you are beautiful.
For example, when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
Oh brother, Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
"Who is always with me and Khalid."
This is the reason.
My love, you are
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter, Nora, to be away from us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife.
We are blessed by this.
I'll tell her father, and God willing, he will bring us good news.
Why did they reject him? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, man!
I'm crying from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
Fine, I'll act honestly.
I perform on stage for a few hours and my role ends.
When the acting is over.
Play roles
I act.
Convey a beneficial vision.
Just you
I wear costumes to act in roles.
On the stage
Just you
You wore it in the guest rooms.
The role of the rich and wealthy woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed!
Lift your head up.
It's a shame.
I missed the scene.
I heard her screaming at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head," poor thing, it broke my heart.
And I walk straight.
Exactly like a horse.
This is Thursday, oh my, Thursday!
This is Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he may not see women, nor women be able to see him.
See how his wife kills him.
Straight, don't turn your face.
I'll expose him in the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please, show them the city center.
Thursday, show me the shape of downtown.
Does Mary call it the central city?
Come on, Thursday!
I wanted to see what Salim wanted.
Oh my goodness!
When will you change!
If only you could hear what they're saying about you.
Even my elders say more than that.
Why are you doing this?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why is she so jealous?
That hour when I sit in front of the TV
Hey, hey
I swear by God.
No, no, it's fine.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
You see this.
I just spoke to her, right in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I'm having difficulty divorcing her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
Mind your own business!
There's nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're spending time with these good-for-nothing people.
Especially this fat one, he is the one I hate the most among your friends.
He has chubby cheeks and hair like baby plants.
How dare he!
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what's happening with you?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Healthy, cured! What's happening!
Our friend Khamis has gone crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Laughed loudly
Khamis is a poor man.
He often imagines his mother and feels like he's talking to her.
God protects his wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He's busy right now, making an international call, very far away, even the call is cutting out.
What's written in the letter?
God help you, Khamees!
Why are you awake!
I can't sleep, I'm up all night.
For tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
If possible, are they?
God guide you, Thursday!
These names were selected from His Excellency's office, the Minister's office.
Okay, let's go.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why were you hinting?!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Just like that.
I saw the last caller ID, read it, you have it.
The last number!
I pressed the last number after I deleted the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salomon.
You didn't believe me.
How are you dressed?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call?
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, give me the password, a pen, call, I'll give you the number.
You cooperate with each other.
Oh men, always like this.
You're just like him, a liar, a bore.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
Cursed me
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is very brave.
You're planning to destroy my career.
It was my mistake to listen to you and call her.
Listen up, Thursday!
She said something about me in the minister's office.
Come with me and tell the whole truth, stay away from this matter.
This has nothing to do with me.
You're a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm pleased you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Flee from it.
Where is Thursday?
He is coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
Meeting at 1 PM
This is not my phone.
The war seemed...
Wow, he's been living with you since that day.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And from that day on, his condition did not change.
Jealous, he envies the presence of women around him.
This is not envy.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Her mother is dead.
That's why I called myself, to find a solution for myself.
I asked you to move to a different section where there are no women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signature clearly below.
Brother, I'm sorry, I've been transferred to the social care department.
Welfare department! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you Madame, excuse me, Mr. Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new office?
Who's in the office with you?
Article, Saleh, Jasim,
Oh my God! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you yesterday only.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
I have to go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will be back in a month and a half.
Alas!
If you want my opinion,
You'll get the same message from the minister.
Work there until we find you another place. This time we're transferring you because many people told us about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what can we do!
Don't talk when your wife calls you.
You never know, they might do it with you, beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, but I put them in the trunk for you.
How much?
We placed ten just like you five in the office, meaning two for each one.
It seems he's very afraid of his wife.
Imagine if he gave me all male names.
And they call me Abdul Qadir.
What's his name?
He's sweet and charming, that's why I'm afraid some girls might like him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, the one sitting next to Hassan, behind Khalil.
These abayas, each one can choose the one they like.
Look at this.
How much is this?
What's wrong? What happened?
Excuse me.
Where is the social welfare office?
There should be five employees.
What's your name?
I am sweet.
I am crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
She opened the project in front of us.
And I met with them.
What did they say?
They said.
"Munaur, prepare tea."
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, go make us some tea.
Go, go, nonsense.
Go, listen to what the man says.
Don't forget we are from the Scorpion tribe.
Go, go, and bring me tea without sugar, go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project is complete.
I called him many times, his phone was busy.
Oh boy, they've been waiting for you for a long time.
He is my brother as usual.
One of them took a month off, I've been traveling for three months and haven't shown up.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all changes are in our favor.
Pour us (some drink).
Ah, but if you build a garden
At least a semi-detached or terraced house.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
What they need is men who listen to women.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea down and leave.
No garden.
Just a moment
Oh sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, do you want to kill yourself?
Saw, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Do not harm your soul.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
Please, you are our blessings.
Yay, Uncle Shahin is here.
Inshallah
Is it Thursday?
Enlarge
Naha has become an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a unit for him, I didn't find any.
I come from a well-rooted family.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Put it aside.
I have a few remarks on his suggestions.
May God grant you a long life.
Something else?
No, may God grant you a long life.
Take care of them, their care, their care, their care, their care, and their care.
What did you do with the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's wrong with him?
I'm leaving now, I'll talk to you later.
What's up?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sister.
And we suffered from them.
Do you know they asked me what I play at school?
I told them that you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
This was just the appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
Are we related?
Do you know what it means?
This time we destroyed your face.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Oh uncle, let me hit the swan in the face.
This is enough.
Save it for next time.
You changed your mind! Didn't you want to study architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman can't work on the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
Shame on you.
Let me break her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Sure, O great scorpion.
You just defeated Fatima.
Let your brother try his luck, Falcon.
This is a flaw.
It's okay, Darking, at least you got a pen on your face.
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
Grandmother?
Come here.
Walk in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up, don't utter a word.
Education is the key to progress.
Not even nursing, we don't mind.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go far away.
Bring us a copy of the request.
Go, go away
Leader of the scorpions, my son!
The big pumpkin itself is offered to you.
Thank you, my uncle, but when is the engagement party?
Miss Manira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Khalid's father.
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How could they let you work!
This is why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is nonsense.
No shame!
# You should feel grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them I can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Hear and be silent.
Thursday, son of Scorpions
He is from our family.
It's true that he's stupid and he doesn't have a degree.
But it's a scorpion.
What are you doing, my dear?
What should I do, Fatoum!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What should I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. You come with your words according to the time the sheikh arrives.
Her smile is sweet.
Go buy new clothes.
Go and buy some new clothes, my son!
I love this laugh.
Oh brother, please.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
How lucky you are, Aisha! You've become the minister's friend now.
I'm afraid it's a rumor. Ah! Bou Khaled.
Muna is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry in the new cabinet structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Are you going to work early?
We should all cooperate to serve this country.
Through everyone's efforts in their own place, thank you.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you, Your Highness
Thank you = Happiness
Thank you.
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's play.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Leader Fatima is talented, brothers!
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is an outstanding forward player.
Traveling to China
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
May God help you.
Your team is going to play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
You're studying architecture.
There's no difference between a man and a woman.
Huh? Go make coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, kiss your mother and tell her you've been expelled from school.
Go, *
His appearance is bizarre.
The coffee in the pot you have has gotten cold.
They call all year round, but when they know you have a series, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her to join us in the series.
Sure, she'll be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaala is playing the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is only twenty and six or seven episodes.
Let Shaula benefit.
Give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid we'll get a headache.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the production company belongs to you and Hamad.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here too.
The manager and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, let's start the meeting, people.
Please tell us your opinion.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Honestly, I think she's the best.
You see why the maid committed suicide.
I know I feel like it's the most influential part for me.
There was a time when the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
They found her and her child screaming, it's crazy.
He kept kicking her until he reached the yard.
Is it excitement?
The police come, search the house, and take the mother.
It's a very great series.
You almost finished the chain here on this table.
This is indeed blackmail of the artistic conscience.
My community
These are all strange events.
Hathil can't believe it.
Seventy-seven cases of murder.
And what's wrong with crying?
You're known for hindering people.
No problem, Professor Hamed, let's stay open-minded.
We vote by majority.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse; these things don't work with a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
He was Indian and had a bag.
He asked me, "Are you Hassa?" I said, "Yes."
I opened the bag.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian brought these things by mistake.
No, it's not wrong.
My name is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is very extravagant.
I never imagined owning a ring like this.
May God provide for you, Hessa, my beloved.
Yeah, that's it, I call it the series of blessings.
Ali and Hamed own the production but they are employed in it, they can't present it under their names.
What do we get more than a ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your creative husband
The one called the wizard.
Just five percent, a little.
No, this is good, they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will get 100,000 riyals, okay.
I think we're giving the college girl role to Nada.
It's a great role, she fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The series we're producing is called Blackmail of Conscience.
Tell me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf series are always like this; blackmail is the trend this year.
Okay, tell my courage, what's my role?
You're next, my love. Your place is guaranteed.
Don't embarrass me.
Jay, Jay, now
I've prepared all this breakfast for you, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protects us.
Why does he want to see me at this time of day?
He told him it would be a weak and silly chain.
Don't waste your money on him.
Okay, so what happened next?
"God protect me, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something evil about the series."
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
Social series
I just saw her on TV.
God doesn't give you a long life.
The series that is currently airing on television is called "Blackmail of Youth's Flower."
Well, I expect the budget they're asking for is too high.
Requires a huge budget
Just don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We need to support her.
What's on him.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they're starting to film the series "Exploitation of Conscience."
And a huge budget is allocated to it.
They just said the series is weak.
Others said the series consisted of a school teaching corruption.
They might stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
Hello. Please, have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I'm Eli Monir. I'm a journalist, and I have an appointment with Professor Hamed, if you don't mind.
Yes, fine, please sit for a bit, because there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will reach out to all the world's correspondents so they can connect with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
Discusses its issues in a way that ranks it among the best productions in the history of the world.
Do you believe I wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like him?
Do we have a journalist like him?
It is the journalist's responsibility to have a sense of ethics.
They work.
Do you think they are here to *
I met the Minister, do you know what he said to me?
It's very tragic and the events are extraordinary.
The first episode will be tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mum?
No problem, Mom, it's just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Similarly, have you seen or do you want to kill your children, except in your soap operas?
My son, art is a sensitivity; not every state can be generalized to people and society.
Oh my god, we can do that in art class, but theater is a whole other thing.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
Don't judge yet, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our kids see this.
Not to that extent, brother.
In worse series and they watch it on TV.
Indeed, not just anyone.
This is your mistake.
For everyone, in every house.
Go and find people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And inform them of it.
What is for us?
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
Why does the minister like it?
Alright, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote this.
I only publish messages that praise the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish praise messages from me and say that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
Enjoy yourself.
For this year
Okay, if they have a deal with him.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Alright, let's say they're all in agreement with them.
I read the translation only.
I wish they would rerun the series Extortion of Conscience.
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I wish they would do it again.
When the minister's office first called me
We can come and collect the final installment of the money in the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
This wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding, and we got our money.
The series is also a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm suggesting a second season of the series.
The minister suspected the journalist's trick that she had invented.
Imagined success that we created.
He's not happy with the series.
It means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can't help it.
Thank you.
For all people
Who worked on this series?
Congratulations on your success.
They all deserve it.
Indeed, winning those awards from distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
This is what's on your mind.
You are creative.
He won the gold prize for sure.
What was he saying?
He said that readers and the press lie to me.
Ah, why not a second part?
The Arab and Gulf TV festivals remain an artistic facade.
Wash the art!
I've heard about money laundering.
No art.
Illegal money
The series are similar.
What can't we do with "one two"?
What do you want?
Didn't we sign a contract with them? They need to comply.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and diverse.
How much did we agree upon in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do to the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone told you about his product?
No, by God, they just told me it was bread, but I don't know its ingredients.
This is bread with a zipper.
Soustha
Instead of cutting the sky, what you call = semolina bread.
The inventor tried to make it easier.
Jean baked bread.
This is the secret.
You eat bread with a fork.
People do a lot of strange things.
This candy is amazing, it melts in your mouth.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I pumped into this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Take a shower! Forgive me.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir. I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Tell him, "Ya! Samih."
We were with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football with his team.
I agreed to the treaty.
To form a team of its drivers and security men,
And we're still a short-handed team, we only have one goalie, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans now.
When I took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
The important people in the company.
They are indispensable.
The hospital took over the pastry shop.
Why are you upsetting the man?
She said he couldn't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after the ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do what he wants.
Just don't take what you can't do without.
What can I do, Mom? We have a match and we need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, what's done is done.
Hamdi wasn't present for work today, sir.
I went with him.
Put on your clothes.
And they had me standing in the Golan region.
The game seemed
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, yeah! Nasser
No ball.
You need to disband your team.
And all bakers return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, please.
I don't want to hear anything.
Oh, Abu Nasser, please!
They listened to what he wanted to say.
Alright, I'll do it, just because you asked me to.
Speak, what do you want to say?
Tomorrow, we'll play the last match in the tournament.
Don't bother him, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, oh! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Zayn, Zayn, Zayn, Congratulations
Oh, wow! Mr. Nasser, I'd like to speak with you for a moment, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Professor Nasser, it's necessary.
Our promise for a party
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
And they invited the press and journalists to come there.
No way! We'll put it in our house.
Even when my father sees the players and their success, he might not cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
Inshallah
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Keep him close to me.
Take a nice picture.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's, the bakers', victory made them happy.
Luminous of spirit
And the effort.
Loyalty to the baker.
Excuse me, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
May God protect you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
The league and the cup: journalists are coming to interview you.
Yes, they're not all from the council.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview for them.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Okay, goodbye.
Inshallah your phone always rings and your pictures are in the newspapers, you are blessed by this football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He lowered the price of the engines, and he said okay.
Yeah, now I'm famous, under every picture of me in the papers, they write: First athlete in the international bakeries.
Were you interested in soccer?
What do you want to say?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say you weren't close to football.
Ever since I started playing football next to me, I've been close to football.
Being close to sports means I'm an athlete.
We've become international Bakriz, we've become the international ball.
I heard him say yesterday that he's going to start a sports club.
And today we meet with the first athlete in the international bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To increase the fun of football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before you go on stage.
The match is tough today.
The team that controls the midfield will be ... today.
Yes, God willing, we are in contact with agents of professional players to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud. Listen, we want commitment.
Ah, he wants the previous deal for the players.
He was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
Is the Gulf just a part of the world?
Certainly not.
This is none of your business.
But you have to notify me when a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open the fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a forward.
Look, these are the four players.
Three for the price of one.
Two hundred thousand dollars per player
Take them all in one bundle.
It's six hundred thousand, I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Sweet, this is about African players, now, regarding the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, he's only worth one million two thousand dollars.
They gave me this price, and then I received a fax. Let me show it to you. It's right here. Wait, look, look. I got it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God reveals, look at his leg from below.
How are you?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to be deceived; hopefully, there's no cruciate ligament tear.
Ah! Bou Nasser
What is this muscle tendon?
Butcher! Make a "mutafahih" (rice and meat, a traditional dish).
You are really lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
Shop, shop
Insha'Allah, you have another business.
No, no, no, just the players.
I see them unpacking boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the forests of Africa.
Yes, why?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is just like you.
The children said, "We didn't hear it."
He said they are young.
As long as we're together
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
"If you take care of him and raise him well, he will be beneficial to you later on."
Go and release him at the stadium.
Come, come, come, come
Go easy on him, he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let it grow.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach should understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
Oh boy, he's the coach of Spain.
I love it.
Successful coach
Controls the game
And this, on the contrary, is Al Wakrah Street.
You shouldn't let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to finish this matter.
If he were an expert in football, he would have activated the wing players and not attacked from the center.
Ah, rely on the offside trap.
Oh mother, don't give me a headache.
He should fire Kakuno Malawi.
Shinamo habbo hitaala hatawa hawawa takes his place.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Shalulo forgot his pills, and he got sick.
What line?
Implementing the plan
And forget Hulu too.
This is what should have happened between the coach and the team manager.
Man of the match, team star
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go to his house.
Don't take him in the bakery van, let him go by taxi.
Your job is not here.
Stay updated.
Did you see what my father did?
The coach was fired and rehired.
What's he doing?
The team is destroying.
Farewell to our team.
Mama, mama
No, he's crazy. I mean, he told you you're divorced. Tell the truth, what happened between you?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this type.
I feel he can't handle responsibility.
Leave this nonsense and talking about the past.
Go to his house and ask him why his daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say, Abu Rashid!
Why did he divorce her, then?
"What is this injustice! Oh! Ya Bou Abdellah. We need to know, we have the right to know, why did it start?"
Please, don't interfere. This is none of your business.
"How can I not interfere? The man is sitting in the living room, waiting to find out why his daughter is divorced?"
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband or respect his feelings.
Is Barcelona ugly?
No problem. You don't know about the Spanish league.
Barcelona is not six.
This is Guardiola's team.
That means I'm going now to the men waiting for me in the lounge.
If I go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
Look up and don't nod your head.
What she needed was not to besmirch Barcelona's reputation.
Messi, the magician of the ball, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And the impudent woman mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter doesn't support Barcelona and doesn't suit us (like us).
"How does that mean!"
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
Apology and her consent.
Ow, damn it.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if it doesn't make our child happy?
Ah, enough.
Above all, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Oh mother, I'm not angry.
She's crazy! My son, forget about her.
Drink your tea, my son!
Do you know, son, they are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I'm sorry for her.
Poor thing, he left her two days ago.
After one month of marriage.
What's wrong with you? Do you want me to fight him?
I don't want to get into trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Don't you know who he is?
What else do you want!
Just her luck.
Do you remember the building I wanted to buy and turn into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura.
It belongs to his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't.
Talk to her brother.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are among the rich of this world to the extent that they bought a palace in Spain to spend their summer there every year.
Okay, what's the news about Barcelona?
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
She has to respect that.
And we do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
May God protect you, his father is called Abu Burjin because he has two towers on the corniche.
Design them in an odd way, like intertwined ropes.
When people see them from far away, they think it's one tower.
What do you think? All the luck is with you.
Welcome
God bless you. Go on, take something, anything.
Thank you, my love.
Oh light of my eyes, my son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry about Nour, my dear Abd Allah's mother.
If I search the entire Gulf, I won't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
Are you done, Your Excellency the Minister? Is there anything else?
Yes, your family is calling you.
Look into their marriage needs, prepare the check and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God has willed, in the name of God, God has willed, with your permission, my master.
Abdullah is divorced again!
I wish you righteous offspring and wealth from His presence.
May God protect you, auntie!
She wears it because of the cold.
Yeah, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, Mother?
My mother says she booked us for Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia? It's fine.
Have a safe trip.
What's wrong? Did you hear about someone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong, my daughter? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Oh mother, she's very arrogant.
Why like this?
She is haughty, forgetful.
I did the right thing when I fired her.
I'm sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why is she sad?
What's happening to her?
Thank you, God. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Done.
My mother says she booked us for the Maldives.
Okay, okay oh! Your daughter is also cute.
And she is still unblocking %pw.
I thought you'd come back happy from your trip.
What gets me is why he took the kids.
Come on! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you angry, my light?
Be quiet! May God give you health, you're telling me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you angry?
If I see the scales, I'll be disturbed.
I wish the one who bothers you would die. My son!
He forgot her, divorced her, divorced her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
"He's quiet, and I know my son, anything small upsets him, why does he live miserably!"
Oh my son, call her and divorce her.
Cursed by God.
Say it to her three times.
You're divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, you have two more minutes.
Divorced, divorced.
Very tense
Oh God! Oh my son, go and rest, my dear. There are plenty of girls, as they say. Go on, my son.
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
I call the one whose mother is? He divorced me a long time ago, saying "You are divorced, divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you, he has no shame.
Now if a woman goes to a disco, what will she do!
And if necessary
What's wrong? The world is upside down!
You see, I go to his house, insult him, and he doesn't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced, O Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
I produce a lot differently.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
You can taste the bitter pill now in your mouth on your tongue and it bothers you.
They didn't do anything.
%pw is what brought you the apple peeled, divorce her.
No problem, you can release them whenever you want.
She's still married to a man.
Is this suitable for you, let it go to hell!
And I felt the same thing you did to them.
What you accept for yourselves.
What you accept for people.
Do you know who owned the land this mall is on?
Is it in a strategic location?
Leave it to God.
And also at a ridiculous price.
Out of scope
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to the library and didn't find it.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I can't, and the problem is I need to get Abu Saqr's approval, I need to.
He's the life of the party.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
In its proper place, God willing, the office is not the home.
Do you eat as well?
What makes this old man so full of himself?
Each one has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd!
Do you know him?
What I know, I only see on TV, and you told me that you meet him during the pilgrimage.
But we don't know each other well.
Let's get rid of the useless chatter.
God guides you, you came straight away, at least ask about the reason for this invitation.
There's no occasion for this, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he hosts fifty feasts.
I suggest, sir, that you be registered in the Guinness Book of World Records.
I am the biggest party organizer in the world.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It is my honor, sir.
Wow! Oh! Abu Flah!
She says Abu Sakr gives a feast every day.
This is what we see.
Just wow! Oh, Abu Falah, the feast tonight is for a special occasion.
Today, may God protect you, my son Falcon.
God willing, your master deserves it, may God bless you.
He is here, welcome, my son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Falcon has to visit the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I waited a year and a half for the approval.
I was bankrupt.
But when I arrived there.
And I give him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things won't work out this way.
I told him "Okay."
So he goes to the exhibition and chooses the car he likes.
We buy three for him.
It'll take you there!
They took me for a god.
You told me that you met him during the Umrah last year.
Today, his young son Shahin
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
Visit him and congratulate him.
He deserves to be well, your honor.
"Oh! Abu Saqr, you scoundrel!"
May God protect you, thank you, people!
Praise be to God that the falcon is well, my lord.
May God help you.
By the way, who are you?
Your Honor
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you.
Oh, Judge, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
May God protect you
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It was a pleasure to meet you.
I mean, Falcon, are you still undecided about entering the business field or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
Why, son of Saqer, trade is good.
Start, open an office, and then you'll see.
Abu Sakr,
Oh, my lord judge, say yes.
Why?
I have a small gift.
Full floor
And if business loves you and comes to you, you'll say no.
Who among you has everything available to them today like you do? Since you got your license, everything has come easily to you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz was telling your father that if he's ready to start working, I'll make him a partner with 50% share.
Oh my god, how can I balance business and university?
Mom, don't make me do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
This is an opportunity, my son! Where would he get the capital to start a project at this time?
Your father's love for people is your only capital.
Be smart and invest in it.
Believe me, my son, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Rose, prepare lunch quickly.
%Pw is still to come for appetizers and spices.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa business.
Your son has a sweet tooth for business.
This is what I was eager to see. Do you know what he told me today?
He said to me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
May God protect him from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son has just entered the world of business."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a partner in two banks.
**T
I think, God knows best, that they still haven't opened it.
Ah, the one in the northern area of our office, what's happening with him?
No, but I love her.
Thank you, and God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God
May God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What do you want to say, man! A whole year of suffering and hard work to get the supermarket ready.
What's up! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me this is Saqr, Abu Saqr's son, who wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Does he want to be your partner too?
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
You started talking to him, right?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said: Business!
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian bakery?
As we were walking past the bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on the sign? What name was written on the sign?
It was written "The Neighborhood Bakery".
No, I want a different name.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
So, how's work going?
Your Highness, God willing, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we will finish the design drawings for the Future Company's worker housing.
No, no Professor Sakr, she is my wife Elisa, let me introduce you to her, this is Mrs. Elisa.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, one person says he wants to work in business, he has money and wants to invest it.
But he has no experience, understanding, or study in economics, not even in trade.
One like this
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Listen up, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what those birds were saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
See it.
See him today.
Oh, my lord the judge, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the base.
Your son, Sager, is a hawk, God bless him, and I don't envy him, except for one thing.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, my son Falcon builds himself.
I was once given a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested his money on his own advice.
"And as Allah willed, look at him now."
Oh my! Oh Falcon, we're talking about ordinary people,
He stole one of them, and that's what Abu Nasser did to him; he took him and threw him in the road.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We should ask who his father is.
I swear to God, I'm amazed.
"Masha'Allah" (literally, "as
Gulf Money Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Please.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong with him?
I swear to God, I don't know what to say, Salim.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
Poor thing, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
And He bestowed upon him much good.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when his arm grew strong, he shot me.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, Salim!
I am shocked.
I can't believe I see people like this in this world.
A man gives to the poor without realizing what his left hand is doing while his right hand does.
The donations of this organization are offered to all Muslims in both Asia and Africa.
But I hope you will clarify your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at Sakr Charity is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Lastly, we are now supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We don't lag behind.
Then I'll come to you right away.
What is this darling?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yeah, anywhere, anywhere, as long as we're together, I'm happy.
My love, may God keep you for me.
Ah! My love.
This is not fair. This is my livelihood.
This bakery
Take your money with interest.
Five real beans, three real hot bread.
Two hummus.
A wide bean, okay, okay.
Cook six broad beans!
Let's go, divers!
The captain is present, and he brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Please, Your Honor!
And what does that mean?
No, no, the thing I'm asking you about is that I want to hear a yes ringing in my ears.
Hello, Nora.
I'm angry with you.
Can I bear your anger?
What's wrong with you?
Why are you angry?
Noura chose a simple and easy dress.
Don't say Anaad will get upset.
Oh my God, these Lebanese can speak very well.
And you shouldn't talk to him too much.
I'm still jealous of her.
The best dress to the most beautiful flower.
He flirts with her by calling her Nora.
Let your blood boil, how much will it take?
I paid twenty thousand and have twenty thousand riyals left.
Congratulations, you've been compensated!
God be with you.
Hello, Mrs. Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
I'm at your service.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the message yesterday?
I'll take it, ah! You idiot.
Did you like the joke?
Hey, did you bring the plan with you?
I don't have time to do them, give me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
Beware, envy starts to work.
When he realizes that my project is excellent and has started generating income.
They say he's going to do a project similar to mine.
Design and Tailoring Shop
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser, he has nothing to do with trade.
In banks
He is his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes, my brother.
Did you know that I was sleeping and they kept waking me up saying that your uncle wants you?
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
Inshallah.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like.
Are you planning to attend to look for a partner or something?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I should drop by.
Welcome.
If you need more, we have it.
Praise be to God, work is going well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh!
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
Yes, do it.
Alright, God willing it'll be easy, goodbye.
This is it.
Are you sure?
And with high fashion, do you know the big disaster!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) Oh, you jealous (Ad) you envious one!
Before you knew the market was open to everyone,
You know.
Open your heart to your brother.
I'm here to ask you.
Denies, lies, and mocks me, saying to me, I,
I wanted to work out of sight.
You're taking the one in the shop next to us, you're trying to ruin my business.
But they didn't say come and be like a headache next to wisdom teeth, you're making me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. By God, I will hit you. This is hatred. Leave me alone with him.
Come on, you're relatives. Oh! People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, I swear I'll hit you today! You with your off-key voice, you.
I'll hit you just like you hit me when you stole my share.
Come on, people!
Just say "peace be upon him," people!
I swear, I swear, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why specifically the Lebanese?
They exchange chatter, jokes, and laughter with him, and feel very comfortable.
This is not how Abu Saleh speaks Lebanese.
He started saying sweet things to me and trying to convince me.
Entice me, entice me with your words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for ninety riyals.
Make money.
A Lebanese designer bag.
Can I see Mr. President's happiness? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, is it still difficult today?
Yeah, today was really tough.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong with him?
"No, by God, I don't know. What's wrong with you?"
Abu Saleh is very psychologically tired after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar; no Qatari opens a shop without another Qatari coming and doing the same project and opening the same shop next to him. Can I go to him?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now, they're thinking of a solution.
What should I do now?
We're sitting here like we've eaten poison.
If we stay like this, I think we won't even make the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
It means we're leaving the field to them.
Okay, thank you, what is the discount percentage?
Why not just give away an evening gown with every wedding dress for free?
No way, let's walk.
What's wrong with you? What happened? We're going to the store next to you; today they're offering two evening dresses for free with every wedding dress, plus a 25% discount.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
And now wait two weeks, they will show the same ad, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing, if we leave them, they'll destroy us.
Don't bother.
What else can I do?
The subject is certainly a challenge.
Certainly, it's a challenge.
Bravo, he deserves it, the arrogant bastard. He doesn't want anyone to earn their living.
If you see the news in the next two or three days, I'll close the shop.
Excellent.
Wait, wait, sugar, sugar, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's wrong with him?
Saud says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit in it, and he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, it's impossible.
The smell will linger in the shop for at least six days.
100% sure.
He came at night.
He cut the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this justice?
By signing the undertaking now, or we'll file a lawsuit and open a case?
Don't do anything for him.
Get me out of this life.
Oh, Abu Nasser! Something strange has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, close the line, close the line, there's a customer coming, I'll call you later. Strange indeed.
He lies in his bed, moaning.
He said it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and said the installments are due.
Debts piled up on him because of his miserly cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Oh no, if they accidentally entered and saw Saad the designer, they would scream at his face and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he can't sleep, his eyes are open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I have no idea what he did to me.
Saud is in the shop.
He put a spell on him, I don't know what he did to him.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, what happened to him!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him to be able to sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forgot it, he deserves it.
Tell me what spell you cast on him, turning the fashion designer into a terrifying creature, making girls afraid when they see him.
Spread a rumor.
It's not possible, people. Tell him the shooting crew needs him urgently.
Oh people! May God bless you, may God protect you. Tell him we need you urgently, urgently.
I swear to God, they're raising my blood pressure, they're killing me, they're paralyzing me. This isn't fair, Professor Abdullah.
It's okay, my dear Ahmed, don't be upset. You have heart disease; this is what suits you, man!
I swear, I've called him more than once, my ears are hurting, but it's just no use. These types drive me crazy, they drive me crazy.
Don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Hear me, I'll give you a hard time.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed: We want to finish.
Okay, I'll stop shooting because the target didn't appear.
How's production?
I don't have anything to do with this matter! Mr. Abdullah, why are you shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What's happening, Abdullah?
A dubber is late and in trouble.
Oh no! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone with dignity and gravitas, who can convince people that he can become a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Sir, please come in, order your meal, and it will be ready in half an hour.
No one, huh! Ala', no one, I was just explaining to him.
Okay, I'll act with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible, and as the production manager, you are accountable.
What are they doing now?
They'll do everything, see the manager, his nerves are showing and there's chaos, but they can handle it.
I need one with specific features. Where can I find it now?
Are you joking?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know one, God help you with him, hopefully he will be suitable.
%PW Saud is very beautiful.
Saud Qunais! I remember him as Saud Alliq.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud Usher, and when he grew up, they started calling him Qins.
Why the cans?
"Why, you ask? May God help him, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilogram."
My rich and distinguished brother, no to despair.
His appearance is suitable, as far as I remember, he is stocky and fat, not tall or thin.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do nice makeup for him, and I guarantee he will look suitable and also funny.
Alright, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's treasure house?
What's he saying?
Be quiet, be quiet.
Saud is a treasure.
We don't have anyone in the neighborhood named Saud Kanz.
Yes, I'm sure it's from this neighborhood, but I forgot the house number.
This house belongs to a man named Saud, and he lives here with his mother.
Yeah, you're right.
But this isn't Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop.
This is certain, but it evolves over time because laptops are like cans.
He is tall, fat, and a bit tanned.
He canceled the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on. Oh, man!
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where's the second dropper? Where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Fix and Ox Brand Oil.
It's a bit wrinkled before you go out.
I just feel worse these days.
Oh, mother, may God guide you. Since yesterday, I've been insisting that you take me to the emergency room, but you refused.
Oh, Mom, they told me they would pay me.
Alhamdulillah, now you are working instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You're fighting with her, getting angry and rising above.
You lean and gradually adjust, and the camera is with you, moving beside you.
Yes. Javer! Yes.
Is this a laptop?
"Shalabi Abu Aboud, this is a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Lamaah."
This is for you, it's my son %pw, Aboud, how are you?
How are you, my servant?
Calm down, my friend, calm down a bit in front of people.
Yeah, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, be quiet, be quiet.
I love acting, I wish they'd give me a role where I get to hit you.
There's no one like you, brother!
I'm so sick, I didn't sleep last night! Oh brother!
Crisis, brother. God heals.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a cup of cherries.
Oh my lord! Oh my lord!
Does he have a remedy for my mother's crisis?
He is a manager, not a doctor.
Mind your own business, listen to what he's saying, he's talking nonsense.
What's his mother's name?
Pah! What are you thinking?
I heard what she said about you.
You say you're careless, you should be more solemn.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million so he can fix my car tires.
And give him three million to get me dinner.
I was asking you why you're talking like that?
Because I'm awake at the request of some people.
Look, Mr. Naive, our neighborhood's production, actors of a high level.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Okay, I'll help you, I don't mind, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a cup of cherries.
Take the groom to the makeup room, do his makeup, and afterwards I'll tell Salman to bring you the bouquet and come to you.
Go, go, go, very nice.
Present, present.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, I'll pay you for it.
Sure, but can someone take me with them?
We'll carry you! Fine, I'll tell the driver to carry you. Okay, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Alright, call your extra friend, call him.
Guys, they're calling for Saud's laptop from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth.
It's written in front of me before.
Okay, let's try again.
Means I
I didn't expect that from you.
We fight, why not!
We're fighting for our rights.
Ah, wait.
You should know who you're talking to, Abu Abdelaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Divorce her and be done with it.
And we don't marry off our daughter to a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He'll do it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you're going to enter the changing room to change your clothes, and we're ready to start shooting.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Hey everyone! The shooting of the scene has been postponed.
Why like this?
I don't want tea, brother. I'm sick of it, my stomach is full of tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how long do I have to wait?
"I didn't see anything, it's perfectly normal."
May God grant you health and well-being.
They're fast.
Thank you, Your Honor, may God protect you.
Greet your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Present, Your Honor.
That was fun, wasn't it?
Whoever resembles you greets you and kisses your nose, too.
The first time someone kissed me on the nose.
How do they kiss them on the nose?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream cone, it'll cut your lips. That was funny, that was funny.
I didn't laugh!
Needless to say.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
Oh my son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Hello Sheikh, hello.
Go see her yourself, man!
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of appreciation.
Get lost, son!
Peace be upon you, what's wrong with you, Your Honor?
Leave, leave, leave, leave
And don't bother, God willing, it will be, ah! Dr. Hassan, come here, come.
Yes, oh! Dr. Hani, what happened?
It's an honor to have you rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be fine.
Hello, hello Your Honor, hello.
Be quiet, or I'll slap you.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Call me, oh! Sir.
How are you, young man?
May he be damned.
Yes, Your Honor.
Hello, sir. Please have a seat.
God bless you.
"To the Chinese, the Chinese language is easy" (proverb).
Go with him, Mr. Rashid.
I swear to God, if I didn't do something for you, tell me and see what I'll do to him.
Oh friend! Can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Oh no! My son, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, I didn't find any of them, they are good and accept anything.
Different from citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, find yourself a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
Oh man! Bro, she's ignoring me.
Present, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intentions are good.
Nothing is wrong.
Follow your path.
Get out, get out, or I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
For me, please.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
"Getting married means getting married."
No, no, I need the car, the clothes, and also the money. I'll rent them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Come on.
What is this %PW Al-Marzouk!
Welcome, welcome, welcome to you.
The light of my eyes signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were amazed by what I did for them; it was a sophisticated and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
You have no argument now.
What is this?
Oh mother, I promised my colleagues I'd be at work tomorrow.
Will you take them for them!
Yeah, what's up?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He'll take this matter to his friends, for the scandals.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yeah, but I promised them now.
And I need to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, the store is open. Go change your clothes so we can find something that pleases people.
"Get well! Let's go."
Their prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent.
Above average, not the best!
Of course, there's premium chocolate, but I thought you were looking for something more budget-friendly.
This is way too expensive. Why are you looking for the most expensive one?
She can't believe it, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested at the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, by the way, there's a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother. Give us some of that chocolate, brother.
What's up, guys?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in accounting.
"By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me one more."
Bring the coffee quickly.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Oh my darling, I went to their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Do you believe me, sister!
Did you listen to your aunts?
That's why I want to throw you an unparalleled wedding.
No time, you only have a month and a half.
I'm preparing everything.
He just doesn't let me do anything.
You live in the community, you see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw with your own eyes
When you buy something nice, you'll see how they praise you and your taste.
They told you it's something imaginary and terrible.
That's true, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate could buy four sheep for marriage.
Don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and be done with it.
That means they'll accept anything we choose.
Yuck, your taste is very ugly.
What's your opinion about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was nice!
What's your opinion on this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought of creating a stage in the shape of a computer mouse.
Excuse me, just a minute.
Look, talk about anything but the theater and arrangements. This is the place where women sit and do nothing but gossip. Just keep quiet.
The train is waiting for us.
We're going to move on to the mouse stage.
It's a very strange phase.
The latest model in 2011.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit on the side, it's all in your best interest.
You have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
We're ready when you are.
Who's the first one to get married?
What do you think about getting married in the Comoros? This is the system in our country.
We're just at the beginning.
If you don't need a stage, where will you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and a little wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit and deceive us; in reality, they are con artists.
What's wrong with you now?
Are you angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I'm talking to the bride's mother and telling her that Saleh has very difficult conditions.
Doesn't he want to get married? Can't he afford the wedding expenses? It's fine for me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure it's the first time in Doha?
Middle East bow!
Put it on account.
How much more will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, okay.
Okay, Samir, I don't want to see this outfit at any wedding.
Do you know what people say about you?
Present, reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
You're opening a subject we can't deal with.
May God help you, Saleh!
But God guides you, you should have tried to fix things.
Alhamdulillah, I've decided to look for a wife from any Arab country.
They say marriage only costs you two thousand dollars and you enjoy it.
May God help you, dear.
If God wills, his wedding will be next month.
Only put down the number of cards you want and tell me.
If the invitations are appropriate, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about yourself, you don't care what people say.
People know the standards of marriage from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the women will say.
Look at their marriage; if these are their invitations, they didn't see so-and-so's invitations.
We didn't say that, we're ordering it online.
It has a cloth cover, made of panda skin and has a silver sheen.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be the talk of the town among women, we mean by asking for invitations that we are asking for invitations!
I'm sorry for him, man.
Poor thing, his family must be putting a lot of pressure on him.
Oh my goodness! This man is collecting money from everyone.
What he wants to say is that he even sold his car.
He looks twenty years older, I saw him this morning talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, poor thing, I don't know when we'll develop.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, ow! Brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
How do you mean my budget?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the illness of appearances, boasting, and showing off.
It'll make you sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there.
Once, I pointed at the bride's mother.
Her words (proverbs) attacked me.
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married,
I'm thinking of marrying a foreigner, not even an Arab.
He says your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser invited a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so angry?
It seems you don't like what I do!
It's enough that he sold his car and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
Previously, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, Mother, that's enough.
What matters to me is neither you nor him.
I am no less than people.
Don't make a mockery of us.
Oh Mother, may God be pleased with you, enough. My brother has spent all he has and taken money from everyone.
Be quiet, please.
My mother has new demands for the marriage and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she screamed at him and said, "I'll cancel the marriage, I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She is there and they are giving her first aid.
He said she was better now and they would find her a room in the hospital.
Shame!
Relax, sister.
The doctor told you to stay quiet and gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I relax my nerves when he wants to play a joke on us for good or for evil?
I told him to buy Abdullah Roaished's album, but he said he didn't have any money.
I'm sorry about your mother.
He was afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her that I'll do what she wants.
I'll get you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he will refuse to help me.
She is not fair, she didn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's wrong with him!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he is an old man, and moreover, he is disciplined and honest.
In my opinion, if you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is because of the crisis she's going through, and she wants to ask Abu Youssef for money from the ministry's funds, of course.
And only God knows when you will return it to him.
And when the accountants came and asked him about the money,
Of course, he could be in trouble.
No one knows, and he knows how to deal with her.
It's up to you; the man is in his office and you're responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
My uncle doesn't call it stealing.
On the first floor.
In it, there is a white box wrapped with a blue ribbon, and on it there is a circle with a picture of a dove's wing. Bring it, bring it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me. If I didn't have difficulties,
Everything is fine.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And you entered my last days.
"And you corrupted me, O Thursday."
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying. If it were anyone else, they would have been beaten or something would have happened to them. Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
Oh, my uncle Abu Youssef, all the methods I've tried haven't worked, I'm drowning.
I can't change my mind about getting married.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the second one, the panic pill, the panic pill.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of discs, which one do you need?
The attic where there is a picture of a terrified man.
We booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought you Abdullah Al-Rowaished and his band.
You'll see, dear.
No, I won't tell you.
It's going to be the hit of the season.
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mama, mama,
Goodbye.
There is no god but God.
Oh my son, don't forget to recite the Mu'awwadhatain when you enter the grand hall.
The women here have fiery eyes.
I told you it's amazing.
The best jinn ever, may God protect you, I don't want to envy you.
Mom, mom, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, my God.
It's not possible, today is my wedding day.
Prepare the people who want to participate in the experiment.
And now, let him be imprisoned, O Lord.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
That's not fair if it happens like that!
The company offered a contract for three million, two million of which were for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but it doesn't reach this extent.
It seems you live in another world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
Why didn't the manager object? They say he was with him!
I don't know anything about it, I swear I don't.
Where is the morality?
The truth from them became a mistake, and the mistake became truth!
Oh Saad! Are you sure the minister fired him? People, what's happening in this world?
Just leave him alone!
What's next?
It belongs to the minister's sister.
Hal is having an affair with the minister.
How strange this world is.
What's wrong with you? Don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee that the minister appointed in place of poor Uthman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh?! Object to the minister!
Are you crazy!
Listen to me, men.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What's happening?
That's him, standing next to the elevator.
This is the reward for honesty and integrity, brother Saleh!
I wish we could do anything for you, my brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things that are unbelievable.
I'm at your service.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work and get some vegetables for the salad.
Try, succeed, okay bye.
Who takes my sister home?
The old rule used to laugh and talk, who is this?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he gives me a ride home? It's fine.
Oh my God, I can't believe it, why do you look so old!
What do you want to say?
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
You're from the old days.
This is old and new about right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we are living in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that keep pace with the world and no one can catch up.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Manira; tension and anger are not suitable for me.
This is one of the things we see in our day.
Tell her you're sorry.
Life isn't working the right way.
Don't be sad, come eat lunch.
Let me sleep and rest.
The manager is not angry with you.
Is the manager not angry?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and eat lunch.
Present, my love.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
It is my honor, sir.
Of course, of course.
Certainly I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of work.
But, at the same time, it's very important.
To remind you of some of the values and principles you uphold.
In the public interest.
This is what honor should be.
We all have to.
Lotting is absolutely necessary, Your Honor.
Be thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
I want to say something else.
And I want to warn you from my first day of work.
Among you is one who is employed.
Who is sincere, honest, and loyal, and who are these bad things?
What changed?
This is an honest employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, things don't always go your way, sir.
Praise be to God, we're all thieves.
As you wish, my lord judge, I will say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you were highly praised, God bless you.
Present, Your Honor.
Oh, my lord judge, you know how to choose!
May God guide you.
Why did you allow the devil to tempt you?
Thank God it was only about honesty.
Oh no, why is my father in prison?
Be quiet, my daughter!
No, no, I'll never do it again.
Oh no, why is my father in prison?
Stop her.
He became honest.
It's a shame to say your father is honest.
This is not it!
Your whole body is covered.
What do people see?
Inshallah, you're looking for a job, no one will hire you like this.
Is there a modest woman who covers her body and conceals her charms?
She covers her chest, wearing a dress, choking herself.
I'm tired of her, my son.
And I bought her a blouse and pants that revealed her midriff above the navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to take the right path.
Here I tell you!
You have no one to blame but yourself.
We ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us is just looking for the right man for his daughter these days.
Let me tell you, my son Rashid.
This man is very good.
He never stops drinking.
It is inhabited twenty-four hours.
Intoxicated, tipsy, and heavy all day.
And don't ask about the commotion.
He has been brought up well.
And let me say also that he is a hypocrite.
And what about theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how about drugs?
Clear, done. I'll leave you five riyals. If you find the pupil of his eye, I'll make a competition out of it.
By the way, hey! Abu Sara, we've come just to propose to her.
You know about the fun and outings.
We know she comes from a respectable family.
By the blessing of the child, by the blessing, that's how life works, by the blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Okay, come on.
Bye, take care.
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, sitting with his hat on, watching a girl with blonde hair.
True, your father walks straight and enjoys it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yeah, you're right.
Oh my daughter, you've confused me.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in two thousand and ninety, after signing the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege on it.
The latest claims promoted by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails daily.
Let's move now to the decisive meeting.
Oh, cheapskate!
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Oh man! What are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Lord Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We fully adhered to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli delegate say?
To find anything solid, stone or plastic, as a commitment.
Oh no! Even our houses!
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In all of Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't want speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very sensitive point, and I would like to vote on this matter because letting one's nails grow is considered a breach of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
So you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you'll start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The kids chase him and tear his clothes, and he doesn't do anything.
How many times has he come without a drop.
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind, we don't want to expel him.
The kids throw chalk at him.
They pull his keffiyeh in the break in front of everyone.
They said about this teacher that he is very indecisive and will do everything wrong.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the deal with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
He saw the kids laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop her.
By the way, the director of your school, whom you will start working with tomorrow, called me.
Alright, fine, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The time for kindness and weakness is over.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You see Rashid differently.
And I don't need to remind you of this important educational saying,
You are an education graduate and I am an education graduate.
And we all know the saying,
The teacher was born first.
You see Rashid the strong.
And if anyone makes a mistake,
He'll be in trouble.
He said, "Just be quiet."
You'll see what I say.
Who among you mocked me and said, "Be quiet"? Who?
You're the one who told me to be quiet!
No, not me.
The one next to you, you!
Go, see the manager.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me?!
What do you think of my anxiety?
You shouldn't just be like this on your first day, you should be like this all year round.
Beware of the consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
I explain or speak.
Do you know what that means?
Tense, do you know what tense means?
Means anxious.
Did you hear my words or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
Go to the manager.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Take your stuff.
I don't care.
It's clear he's still looking for him.
No, Doctor, we didn't see it.
On the side, ice cream with milk, if it has strawberries inside, it's very sweet.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and man is fallible.
Hahahahahaha
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
I want the chocolate in my bag, not this one.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your service.
He says he's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a regular kid.
The disaster, how is the disaster green and not red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one chip.
I took him before them all, I bothered them. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, go to Saud's place and get the PlayStation CD from him.
What do we learn from this story?
This person
You should have had some morals.
This is a PlayStation device, he also told me to bring the whole PlayStation at once.
Alright, do you want something else, my friend Abdurrahman, my friend?
There's nothing now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm traveling this week because I got accepted into graduate school.
I mean, I expected to hand in the party file before I travel.
How can I pick you up this afternoon? Abdulrahman told me, but I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me when!
His father came back and didn't say anything to him, thank God I'm safe and relieved.
Let's say he took it this afternoon, got upset, and told his father, "No, no, no, a disaster, no, no."
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman.
May God help you.
Make it an order.
Do you like it, do you like it like this?
Today, guys, we're taking a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you too.
Thank you.
I need water.
Whatever you ask, whatever you ask for, I am at your service.
Doctor, doctor. How do you ask the doctor for water?
Is there a professor who gives water to a student? You are a strange person. This matter won't pass like this; I'll write it in the report.
And you're still messing around, messing around with me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, you hear me?
Is this enough for you people?
Fine, is this your car?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What's he doing?
As you can see, he's going to build a car park in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Fine, I broke the table.
Don't be afraid, brother!
Why like this?
Are you different?
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, oh brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, that's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother!
What do you mean by "There's no need" and you want to make things easy for me?
What do you want to say?
Instead of what, what do they call it?
It seems you want this.
You want this, take it easy.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
He doesn't like this, it's not fair!
Who owns the neighborhood.
We're going to my uncle Abu Naif to discuss, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid who does what he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Present! Hey, everyone, quiet down, let's hear what Uncle Abu Naif is saying.
Now, this scoundrel isn't worth a penny, he's playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If you don't slap him in the face, he won't stick to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players (proverb).
Is this normal?
%Pw Goodbye.
I still haven't seen anything.
Do you know he has a jewelry store?
That's why I see you wearing all these rings and chains.
"Oh God, compensate us"
Just walk, are you going to stay in the heat?
How true that the naive and poor Rashid has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You're a teacher and he's a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Needless to say
No need to mention, ah! Abdullah.
What's the secret?
The professor came, the professor came.
Doctor, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Yes, my love, I know who he is.
Here I say, we won't find a nice opportunity like this one.
I'm looking for a job! It's so funny, really funny.
No, brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
Your mother sends you her regards. May God protect you, I'll tell her, he sends his regards.
Okay, goodbye, dear. May God protect you.
What else do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, can you believe it, my son!
Yay! Mom, we're working, we're working at a high level.
Come on, son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
Just give it to her like that.
This is normal, right?
Perfect! This is automatic, no doubt.
My love, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
Building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is angry.
"It doesn't look like him. Oh! Dad."
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
You believe he stopped, took the phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's something behind this story, and I'm a hundred million percent sure that Abu Sultan has it in for him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't good.
No, Abu Sultan wouldn't do that unless he intended to do something else.
"By God, to that extent?"
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he starts to open the minister's car doors.
Oh my son! Don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the country.
I just can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women are starting to talk about me. Don't forget Latifa, the dish collector, she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I'm going to faint.
Please, I know what to do.
This is none of your business.
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
To release them to separate him.
Yes, plan.
He trusted me from the beginning.
They told me they appointed him as a minister because he was appointed before me by two months.
Because I'm sure he's going to lose his job.
Magic can be undone.
What is this?
What's this again?
And at every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him until his image becomes widely spread in the newspapers.
Winton Lane floats on the surface.
Are you sure?
Wait a minute. Let me work on it and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Of course, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
I mean, tell me,
Did I thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The reel is outside, go check it.
Don't act stupidly, people want to elevate your status and you want to humiliate yourself.
Just the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take a picture of me. Just His Excellency the Minister, a picture of you.
Take another second.
Oh brother! Honestly, I liked your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he still is.
Present, I hear you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say there is no god but God!
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist, well, well, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
Fills the eye (wherever you go).
They are envious, they envy you. Only the tree that bears fruit is stoned.
Take me to the market!
Is he civilized?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
You're home today, are you sick?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts me, I feel pain all over my body and the colon is getting worse.
I'm tired, really tired. I've been running around with him for a month.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh! Oh, my mirror, I want only him to take me.
You started to love her.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is worried, it seems he likes this story.
I'll send my brother Saad to you.
No, I didn't follow any activities and I didn't read the newspapers, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants to destroy an ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, sir, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
Needless to say, don't you have any events like parties, birthdays, or weddings?
I don't know, but you can check with the hotel behind our back.
Hey, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Is it okay if I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
God helps everyone.
Will this minister let us sleep or rest?
He couldn't find a party, a wedding, or any problem to throw him into.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and found nothing for him. He has bad luck like his face.
Just shut up, hello.
I didn't find him a birthday, nor anything.
Go, you might make it for the second half!
He has a hundred pictures on every subject.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired, my brother!
Wow! The editor of the newspaper says the first thing is to prepare his picture, and then I'll prepare the newspaper.
She said my children had a contest based on your husband's ministerial photo.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
The winner wins a prize.
That's not the whole story. You have to come to the coffee shop and listen to the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. They never stop gossiping.
Wow, his death is very near.
As they say, when God wants to destroy the butterfly, He draws it close to the light.
They will abandon you and embrace him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Needless to say, who is he?
You've ruined my reputation.
May God envelop you and her in His mercy.
She said that we were all married except poor Amal; she was the only one of us who didn't get married.
This is my fate.
It's written that I will get married.
And forget about marriage.
God is sufficient for whoever relies upon Him.
Do you see the spoiled ones sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the guy playing with his hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean he was killed.
You saw it, it grew before your eyes, right?
He shouldn't keep clinging to the maid.
Go make tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two for herself.
I've told you a thousand times not to interfere, Khalid is my son, not yours.
Your only problem is Khalid and the workers and the workers and Khalid.
Oh my god, this isn't working, Khalud is with the maid 24/7 and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my dad about you.
Let me tell you something, what's wrong with Khadija?
Saud says Khalid is wearing makeup and walking like a girl. What's going on? What's going on?
Oh my, oh my, oh my! Oh Saud.
Khaled puts makeup on his face! Just a little makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small dot, barely visible.
He is kind, friendly, and gentle.
I upset Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Khaldi, what do you want to become?
This year we'll go to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the trembler in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susn, Khulood, and Fahida.
Say hello to Samra.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow, oh! Amal, my father opened his eyes and told me you graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh my God, heal me.
The way you speak has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
God willing, do you talk to people this way outside?
How true! Oh Khalid.
Please get out of my room!
Alas, Khalida!
You disappointed me.
Come on, don't make me angry, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Poor thing! Khalid, the light of my eyes, may God give all children his kindness and sensitivity.
And when you see someone kind and calm, you call him gay.
Shame on you, it's wrong of you to say such things about your brother.
Okay, there's no need for all this fuss over nothing.
Goodness, he just uses a very sweet perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
I'm telling you, don't say that in front of your father.
I have.
Be quiet, just don't let Mohammed notice anything.
How do these girls gather?
It's not right for a pretty girl to do this!
Don't read it, don't read it!
I'm afraid I feel like it's something to do with him.
Ease up on yourself.
I know you're following the widespread distribution of Bluetooth these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Do you want to drink anything?
I've seen him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
Seek refuge with Allah from the devil, my son!
Booked before
I'm going. How can I face people? I can't!
And what should I tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids only bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Certainly, that's to be expected.
Stop, please get out.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar was broken.
I can't live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is locked for a bit.
And you're blaming me, Amal?
You're a girl and you waste every day of your life at home.
What can I do? I'm a man who deals with people all day long.
Tough, Amoul!
I can't live while spending my day, my life, and always having my head bowed.
My father has been feeling for a while that something is wrong in the house and that there has been a change.
How long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my parents and sometimes I don't.
How can I blame him, Amal! When I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
I hold him responsible.
When he leaves the house and the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to bring up the past right now.
Does your father know or not?
But I'm ready.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
It'll be devastating.
Oh! Hope,
Yermina knows.
It's much better to know from someone else.
Our house's condition has reached this extent.
Because a dirty bomb named "Khalid" was detonated in it.
Traditions and customs.
You'll find them rude.
They stopped their ears from it.
And they don't want to listen to him.
They listen to only one voice.
Shelly is the filth and the strangeness.
They trample on all the good.
What's on your mind?
She suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, "God help you, my son!"
May God help you.
Those who return are the ones who bring the gift, not those who travel.
You're right.
This is the law.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did he see her, my daughter?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Oh dad, what's wrong, dad?
Oh, Daddy!
Don't be sad.
You are a great human being.
And which man would want to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because there's something wrong with you.
Divorced from you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept my children's uncle.
One like me is like your brother.
Salwa
You're here every day.
Before you even come,
I was hiding underground.
That was the first time we were underground.
This is very strong language. Can you handle it?
You get a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say what God wants.
Go, go.
I've only been here for seven months, stop complaining and take me home.
Cheek and nerve! Every time he goes to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing is ever good enough for him, and today he asked for a raise.
He's making fun of you, this driver.
He came less than seven months ago.
Hit me, son, hit me.
Give it back to him, so we can get rid of it.
Take it back and go get another one!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know what it costs in time and money.
And driving training. Return it and get rid of it!
The first time I came here to my apartment was six months ago.
Present, I'll tell you something new.
Petrol is now $114, before it was 50 cents a liter, maybe 5 riyals, everything has become expensive, sir.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm telling you!
Where were you when you first came here? What salary did I give you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've only been here for six months and this salary of eight hundred is a lot.
I need money.
The drivers you're talking about are old, old, you're new.
Seven hundred became eight hundred.
Walk!
He said, "I'll give you an extra hundred riyals."
And it's useless in three hundred ways.
I told you so.
No, no, Shashi. I'll get into trouble if I run away.
No, I'm scared, Shashi.
Those who run away from their sponsors.
Why are you afraid?
Due to the past actions of these people's ancestors.
I pay them between six hundred and seven hundred. Do you know how much they take?
How much is your salary?
So, why are you afraid?
What scares me
God suffices him.
Wake Nasser up and tell him to go see it.
There was no limit.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have I done!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with theirs.
You may go, sir, you're excused.
We'll look for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they run.
They put us in trouble and harm us.
I told you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I'll find him no matter what.
He will come back, meaning he will come back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
It's up to my knees, I hope I find it.
No one's buying right now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what are we afraid of? We were afraid our team wouldn't score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid; you were scared of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our level, I know. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Excellent! The foxes have scored a goal now, you're ahead with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, men.
Why try, you can't beat our team!
Your Honor, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "It's a big problem."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up at the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend Sajid.
Take it, boss!
What did he do to himself?
Ah, he's the Indian one.
Yeah, man, he's a soccer fanatic.
Don't say that about my team, the Foxes.
They will win, they will win.
Come on, Sajid! Come on, Sajid! Quickly, quickly, the match is starting soon. Take some water with you, we have a match against the Foxes today.
Dear viewer, with us today is one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, known as Fox.
They say you beat them because they were missing players.
They say, their words are not correct.
What's missing? Each team has 12 players.
If it's not one or two, it won't make a difference.
The wolf is very smart.
This is the best fan we have.
Present, on the occasion of the victory of Oh! Vulpes, a final word you would like to say to the foxes.
All the words stopped.
When they mention the name of foxes.
Her name is high in the sky.
This is a good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him just as enthusiastic.
Come on, sweetie.
Where is the Indian who loves football?
I haven't seen him in ages.
Oh my! He's become a big star, he doesn't come here anymore.
I saw the guy a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in Villagio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and didn't even have money for a cup of tea.
The boy in front of me gave a twenty-riyal tip.
What made him like this?
Wow! [Person's name] sits with important executives at the club, helping him and agreeing to everything he wants.
If possible, can I say something, Fox?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come.
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
These foxes are my team, they are my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes in it.
I haven't heard the poem, Your Honor, that was written about justice.
When we played a match against them.
Please, please Mr. Fox! Read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. Oh God, who knows my secret.
My spirit is very tired.
I never sleep at night.
We are Fox Club fans.
Can you tell me the winner's name because I have an exclusive news.
We will have a press conference, and if God wills, we will announce the winner's name.
Who spends.
Thaloud Al-Mashhoor, this fan who was honored today by the management of the Foxes Club in a generous, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Fox, on this wonderful honor and this lovely gift, of course.
What do you think, a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is a sign.
I'm telling you, this is it.
We need to inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All the fans, every single one of them, all the fans.
No, no, no! Oh, son, it's not him, it's someone who looks like him.
I'm telling you, that's not him.
I'm late.
I don't know the game schedules, brother!
Now how can we catch him?
We just have to wait until the Foxes play their next match.
That's it, that's it, I saw it.
Alright, let's follow him.
Oh brother! You're very late.
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it.
Follow him, follow him, follow him, follow him.
The problem is that we don't know if this is it or not.
I'm telling you, boy, this is it.
I say the right and wise thing is to go to them, ask them, and tell them that the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Oh dad, you always complicate things.
We talk about him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, may God preserve it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Also the other earth next to him.
My father, Abu Abdulrahman Alsoubaji, sends his regards. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, please, but I think we made a mistake. Oh! My son. We came to a friend of ours and mistook you for him.
God glorifies Him, creates many people who resemble each other.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Honor, thank you."
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Present, if you please. Excuse me, and I am here to help you. Goodbye, may God honor you, goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I have no idea what your father will do! I'm very scared.
What have you done, oh my God, Walid.
When, when, when me, I was walking, my bag's handle got stuck.
Try to solve the problem now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Try now to make your father understand this thing!
Before my father finds out?
It broke into a million pieces.
Okay, mom, let's buy something like that as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Oh Mother, please!
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
Mistakenly, he hit his bag with the vase and it fell and broke.
Oh mother, I'm afraid for him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy? Oh, my daughter!
Scaring him and terrifying him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
Can I say something, my daughter?
Where is the boy going?
Okay, if he comes, I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Waleed is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
Come on. Come on.
This is it.
Oh grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me with you.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear to God, I don't know.
This is how your father, may God guide him, scares you.
Come with me, my son!
Don't be afraid, my son, as long as I'm in the house. Don't worry, my son!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid.
Please, I beg you, Abu Walid!
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Oh my son, I swear to God, your father won't do anything to you.
Are you sure, Father?
Yes, oh! My son, yes.
Are you going to leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and said, "I need you to get me one like the one you got for me, but Waleed broke it."
He wants exactly this. I went and couldn't find anything other than this, the last one in the store. He's lucky. Where are the kids?
Inside the room, he studies.
Alright, I'll take care of it.
Just this game and I'll stop.
Wow, amazing!
Okay, study!
My father only plays this game and doesn't study.
Please, Daddy, don't tell Uncle.
Oh dad, don't tell your brother, oh dad, this is the last time, I swear.
I name it.
And you, in particular. You insulted me, your friend at the café?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't!
Alright, I won't call. This phone is in my pocket if you want to study normally.
Oh my daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
May God guide you, my mother.
He terrifies him to death because he beats him all the time.
This boy is poor.
Patience.
Mom, where's Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
And she went with her.
My sister doesn't accept wearing abayas.
Oh, oh! My dear, I haven't told you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
She gave birth to a baby boy. May God protect him.
And of the same length.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Yusuf doesn't.
I found out about the matter yesterday.
He argued with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He should take his son and tie him in the middle of the yard.
And then tell him to do it again and pee in your bed.
This is much ado about nothing.
What did you say, O woman, O Umm Munira?
I was telling her, "Eat, eat."
Eat and be healthy.
Alas!
Mama, mama.
Thank God your father didn't find out about you.
He'll kill you with his fists.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up and causes a disaster.
I won't listen to you.
Come on, guys!
They weep and tremble.
I'm afraid something bad might happen to my kids.
I have to take them to their uncle so he can punish them.
I'm nervous.
What they failed at, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle's?
Nasser got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
To be honest, I agree with his point of view.
Forget the feelings.
And He punishes them.
Present, I'll bring, I'll bring.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He wastes our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get a perfect score?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I warned you, but you don't listen to me.
You don't listen to my words.
You rude boy!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Ouch! Stop, uncle.
Until next time, review well, review!
Okay, enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll make you jump one after the other and turn into falafel.
Beware of going with your family to public places.
Creates misunderstandings for us.
Professor, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You should be happy.
Oh my! My son, everyone has gone, even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance, meaning he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatened him that if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, you! Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome to a new episode of our program "Without Borders."
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have six hundred and eighty-six billion barrels.
Iran follows with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and then Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each of them then comes to Venezuela by seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded $109 for the first time in history.
And in this episode, we try to understand many complexities around oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite its sky-high prices
Similarly, the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What appears later on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because today the market is the key factor.
No production countries
The day that determines the price is market strength.
No, it's not OPEC.
Certainly, supply and demand play a role, of course.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Financial and real estate markets
and stock markets and others
I moved on to prices in speculation.
Goods like oil, for example
And tomorrow he will receive one thousand dollars, God willing.
Oil jumped to forty-four dollars a barrel in 2004.
And today we see that even oil prices are rising.
Fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below $90.
increased in the second quarter
Especially with the arrival of spring, and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always, for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, the temperature drops below ninety degrees.
And all this indicates that speculation has power and control over the market now.
Things have changed a lot since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a major reaction due to its link to the so-called expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Implications
It can quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
His influence is certain and will have an impact.
Even speculators react to political effects.
This could prove, he says, some say the American war on Iran is coming.
What's happening here in the market? The market is optimistic in a way.
The question, Mr. Speaker, now in light of what has happened from the White House.
This returned the area to an atmosphere of tension.
This is the mystery.
But Fallon might have seen this situation.
He has a quick mind in the oil market.
Today, we proved with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: in the last seven weeks.
In the United States, their oil reserves have increased to more than half of what they were in the past five years.
Today, I mean... I don't really mean to say...
We won't need it even for the next war because today I'm telling you that the world has a profitable warehouse.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find a long queue in front of gas stations.
That's another story.
What are the potential risks arising from this issue?
What number do you think it is? I don't know.
Two hundred dollars or maybe three hundred dollars, maybe a little less.
It's possible to reach a point where these tensions become real.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In distant lands, even from oil-producing countries.
It will have a reverse impact on the oil market.
It can go up to three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other to the oil market. Today you will see more than two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
The speculation is over a hundred a day.
Tensions in the region and waiting.
April, as previously stated, will be the month to decide this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, it's not my fault.
in the region because it is now
This is an election year.
And the current American government only has a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not expect events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America doesn't pay anything; it's you who pay, along with Iran and consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on Africa's oil, and it has many alternatives.
See, there's nothing, let's talk frankly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent
Oil reserves
But now they export twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and everything they export from any other region in the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called deep water production or offshore production from the deep seabed.
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough player.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They vandalize and destroy it.
The important means is
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) is why these regions are considered difficult.
And the energy needs of states
Certainly means there's something called secure supply.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But in some fears
About President Bush who might be
Try to notice that political risks do not come from the Gulf countries.
It means it's not a matter of generosity because none of us are dealing with generosity.
No dealing with Wade Karam.
But not "in the current field"
We're part of a charity.
Or being generous.
But he is generous to Westerners and not to anyone else.
With America precisely.
Where is the market?
Wherever we find economic benefits, we will go.
We don't win.
Like oil and gas
You're putting it aside out of generosity.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
Over sixty to seventy dollars
No to price hikes.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are in the first place as a Gulf people and OPEC organization.
Your export is calculated in dollars, and you are refusing.
Currency exchange despite the collapse of the currency and therefore
Even if going back isn't in your favor.
No, it doesn't have to be 70.
It's the experts' talk, not mine.
Okay, the dollar fell by thirty percent and oil rose more than this decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course.
Oil prices increased.
But it's a minor increase, Your Honor.
It means, if we take it.
We consider him now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to the year two thousand and four.
Surpassed even the rate of decline of the US dollar.
Fascinating is
React to the dollar's decline.
Whenever the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is when the market started giving him its feeling.
Our concern now is focused on reduction.
No, the situation has changed. Maybe at the beginning of the two-year reduction they were saying this, but the situation has changed now.
And the dollar began to lose value against major currencies such as the euro and the pound sterling.
The question is, why do you link your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
Remember America in the mid-seventies.
The gold standard for the US dollar was abolished.
This is not correct.
Okay, tell me the truth.
OPEC comprises
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the world market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
# The article related to the tax
If you set a price in another currency, everyone will do the same.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries need to agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are good at it.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
Precautions, but I consider them export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all those countries organized under OPEC.
Her market share does not exceed forty percent.
Made and exported outside OPEC
This is what is useful and related to the forty percent.
One doesn't know the worth of something until...
In some countries, they only tried.
It's a genuine attempt.
It's you who refuses because of your American commitments.
From dollar to another currency
Oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
If they import it, it will be a loss.
And his work increased greatly.
And he sells his oil in dollars.
Upon receiving it in his input or receiver, he obtained his silver in dollars and then converted it into his local currency.
My salary is not linked to the dollar.
True, but he...
But that's still your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, then you don't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and impacts of pegging your currency to the dollar amid the dollar's decline?
Not seen for years
Especially in the 1970s, when the dollar was a very strong currency with significant influence.
This separation isn't easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, they are not.
Divorce has its costs.
This serves the interests of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that it is present in 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report by Gulf Money and Business stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement on Dow Jones that I don't believe is genuine.
The governor of the Qatar Central Bank was exiled.
He said yes and mentioned that there will be a study, but all Gulf countries must also.
Profit and loss should be examined carefully, free from emotions.
Finish the topic for the test and let them come.
Look, I can get you other economic experts who can do a second study.
This contradicts this study.
The global house said something simple and organized, and it was issued in a report on March 8.
Just four days ago.
The world's home is the simple solution and needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
Her intentions or the five with Kuwait, regarding her intentions in 2010 to issue a currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to eliminate the dollar.
First, regarding the unified currency.
From my personal point of view
Let's see the united Gulf currency.
This currency will have strength.
"بتكون" translates to "You will be" in English.
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you mentioned.
And what comes from huge reserves and revenues?
That's why the Prime Minister focused on this when he said...
Gulf countries because no single country can do it alone.
Unless it has strong economic content
And today, even the Euro is seen to be growing economically.
Of course, we should not forget the role of the large central bank.
Evaluating
And the profit and loss account
From all these news
Tense situation
Two thousand and eight, as the observers said, the Global House stated that this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution lies with the governments.
Some countries have increased salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
Stopping the inflation process
And this is my question now: When will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your response after a commercial break.
# Today's Episode: Oil Reserves and Daily Production of Gulf Cooperation Council Countries - Saudi Arabia is one of the largest oil-producing countries in the world, with enormous oil reserves. It leads the list of oil-exporting countries and contributes significantly to the stability of global energy markets.
He has a reserve of sixty-two billion.
And two out of ten barrels.
Producing nine out of ten daily.
Millions and Kuwaiti 100 and 1.5 and produces a billion and produces 2.7 million.
Qatar, with a population of fifteen and a half billion, produces eight hundred and fifty thousand tons of oil. Oman, with a population of five and a half billion, produces seven hundred and seven thousand tons.
Bahrain has 25.1 million and produced 35,000.
The total annual revenue was thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe is one hundred billion.
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in 2017
The total in 2007 is expected to be seventy-nine and seven-tenths billion.
Be in 2912 and 1/10 billion.
While relentless inflation devours the salaries of employees and people working in this area.
But it will increase in 2008 to 3.8 percent.
Kuwait is fourteen percent, but it is expected to be eight and nine tenths of the United Arab Emirates in two thousand and eight.
It's 10 o'clock, while in Saudi Arabia it was 6:30 and it reaches 6.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eaten up.
What amounts and percentages do you give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries always increase.
What is the solution?
I have no objection to raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true
We always
Of course, she believes.
In the case of an increase, increasing without controlling inflation will cause inflation to devour all these increases.
Solve inflation, which is a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists.
And now this committee is forming.
Because salary increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics states
It won't have an end.
And whatever it is
Salaries are increasing widely and no matter how much they increase.
Inflation is increasing.
The solution is obligatory and necessary.
With a scientific study here at Bayt.com Institute, specialized in employment, a study was conducted with the assistance of the British YouGov Seraj.
They conducted a survey of fifty people from different nationalities who work in the Gulf countries in twenty important sectors.
Especially experts and professionals, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
You're considering moving from these countries where inflation keeps rising.
Now you'll get lost.
This concept is easy and simple, and try to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
It's available.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are trying as much as we can.
Solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, but rather complicate it further.
"Zaydooha" is a
We hope to have more time for this committee to finish.
All applications
This is boredom and your happiness.
Boredom will always remain.
Right, but the government tried and patched the increases with forty percent.
Here's an important point regarding the topic of increases.
Regarding salary increases, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You consider Qataris but you don't consider expatriates.
while the higher ratio in is
Oh Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone talks about it and suffers.
Much higher salaries than in the government sector.
And vice versa, we saw.
In the government sector
And vice versa, the public sector becomes.
Because the best units and competencies started.
I read the report later, as you know, we are in the oil field.
Work
We love our experts.
Engineers and workers come from outside Qatar.
Because we're still dealing with the global market.
What's the rate of salary increase for all these things?
Hope is in God the Able, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
A temporary solution only.
"And we'll see, I'm sure."
It's going to be
Positive results
It will be at the edge of fifteen percent.
Alright, the second good report says that twenty-two billion barrels of oil will come to you and forty-three billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, what is a spraying process.
Action and of course we
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on the people.
And today, Qatar reflects the highest economic growth rates in the world.
And vice versa.
The massive conveyor belts in the country are also part of it.
And if we were without these massive "carriers" and big projects
In this country, it won't be part of the inflation.
This resulted in some inflation.
And this one also made a lot of money in the market.
First, regarding the dollar's link to oil.
Oil for protection
I am from the United States of America and thus stable in power.
Thank you
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, O Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God.
It's a nice episode and a nice title.
I'd like to talk about the region that came under American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an unavoidable currency for the whole world.
Brother, I say buy now.
And now the Gulf region is transforming.
Place
Thank you, Brother Saad
Mohamed El-Wasea from Egypt
Peace be upon you, Mr. Agent. Who is this?
Middle Eastern rulers, Your Highnesses, remind me of...
When he is in
When there is a demand for price adjustments.
Adjusting salaries against prices as you promised.
In Qatar, we considered you a role model.
Insist on what he promised to raise.
We want to calculate Abu Treika's diameter.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Of course, it's his right; he's in charge of this policy.
The question first
His happiness needs to be taken into consideration.
This is the second time he has to respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people of countries that need special care.
Arab leaders don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
Good evening to you and good evening to His Excellency.
My father wants a raise in salary.
Salaries are excellent and sweet, that's nice.
Okay, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will remain with them, God willing. We know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are certain of that.
Judge that Qatar is as he said, that the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Roll the dice first, brothers.
We can't judge.
What's the use of wealth?
Now there are new cities almost like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar is expanding.
This is not the current situation.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will do?
Qatar now, there is Qatar beyond oil and gas.
In a clear policy of the state
Because it is she.
Non-renewable wealth
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
For today, the trend in the State of Qatar
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Second satellite channels
It's not just an island, it makes a hundred islands, and of course we don't accept just an island.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, there was a boom. Now everyone remembers the boom of the 1970s.
Now let's see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This calls for a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
Our vision for oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Peace be upon you, I greet you this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
Enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
Indeed, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
Thus, the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006
And the unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon continues.
And in the time when Qatar reconciled...
At its oldest age, Saudi Arabia, since about two years ago.
During the same period, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file where he succeeded when others failed.
Lebanese leaders gathered in Doha where they signed an agreement that ensured their safety.
Final elections
Difficult files too
This is what mattered to be the engine for these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
And in today's episode
We try to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
And whose interest?
Qatar, the smallest country in geographical and demographic terms, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications make him able to do that?
And that will be in a live dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
For viewers who want to participate, you can call us on the program's numbers that are displayed on the screen now.
Visit of the Emir of Qatar
Al Jazeera launches its cannons to enhance relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murra tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th of last month.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things are not.
What I believe is true.
In many interviews here in this program, I always said that the correct thing is that
And we consider it the backbone.
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover, the
And different viewpoints.
It's true that the border issue is over and it was a big obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari ties were distinctive.
These bindings, if we notice.
Between the two countries and both families.
Destroyed by misunderstanding
Neither us nor them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And I'm done, and the relationships are now in an excellent condition.
For the benefit of the Cooperation Council
But how did relations improve between Qatar and Saudi Arabia when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason for that in 2001?
At an important point
And I repeat, if I go back to all the programs, I always say
Not just the older sister, I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was a sharp and clear exchange of information between the two parties.
These countries are throwing away their souls.
Failed when the brothers agreed.
# Especially the Saudi-Qatari house, especially the Saudi-Qatari house
On the contrary, they found themselves in a struggle.
A place with no camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone involved in this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, may I put things right or dot the i's and cross the t's?
Many observers believe that the island has undergone significant changes in the past few years.
At a time when there are still criticisms on Al Jazeera's screen.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia?
Are the detainees, opponents, or others still standing?
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has turned into
Praise be to the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of difference.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because
This unites the two countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
In the Gulf region, there are many issues.
Also, the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
Affected all listeners and the entire Arab world.
Spoke from his heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just from the point of view of opinions.
No, it's about politics and politics is a matter of opinion.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
Talk about the same interest.
Now I've been sitting for many years.
The situation now
He heard first.
There's a difference between this topic and the other topic.
The idea of a small state facing off against larger nations and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
She has her reasons.
And its causes are above.
Through the wisdom that guides us both
Is there insurance for the future of the relationship?
Between two parties' guarantees
Based on love, brotherhood, and the interests that bind the two countries.
And the leaders, their speech is considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And we hope, God willing, for the development of Saudi-Qatari relations.
For the better, and there will be more fields.
For this relationship as it is with other Arab states, other Gulf states.
Qatar is an important state.
Alright, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that at the same time it reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
What is Al Jazeera?
For or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab state.
First of all, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And her interest
On many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation.
And in this case
Some people might believe that we are trying to reach an understanding with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt through this case.
In light of what you say about your respect for Egypt and the Egyptian people
And we see him as a kind person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
They accused us of planning to topple Gaza, but I don't believe it.
And we don't interfere.
In cases belonging to other countries
Intervention in the affairs of any state is only justified if there is a scope for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course I don't deny it, we didn't know about this thing as much as people learned about it from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt differ from you or dispute with you on this point?
I'll get to it.
Hezbollah is a conspiracy.
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised about this matter.
Thorns for Qatar's benefit.
What the pyramids said.
They said pyramids.
Attack on Egypt and its position
Can I reply?
Let's go back to the plot they mentioned.
You'll see in time.
What was the beginning of the Gaza Conference?
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back far enough to the Port Conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the exhibition that was held in Doha?
And that was an agreement, and when the conference was to be held with us.
They said they don't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know you are coordinating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this"
What we're trying to understand why.
We sat and talked, and talking is always good.
I have two parts.
What are these?
In disagreement
In the political orientation
If we look at the gas conference that was held
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were informed by a foreign state.
Our brothers in Egypt have a perspective on the matter that it cannot be done.
People are killed and we watch.
If you want it to be held in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It is a shame to discuss the issue at the Kuwait Conference on the sidelines of the event.
Israel and the Western world stand and see what is happening.
When we all said okay, this became a normal thing, and there is no power or strength except from God. We Arabs cannot stop it, and no major power has been able to stop this fighting.
Egypt's announcement called for a halt to hostilities in Gaza, and within an hour the battle stopped.
Even us
We should not deal with the Arab street with such naivety. Our difference with the Muslim Brotherhood is on one point.
This is in accordance with international standards.
And the hospitals are not enough, and doctors are being detained at the borders.
Were you the ones standing at the border?
It's there, and no one can enter.
You don't accept the right of the brothers.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of its national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are only talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but that doesn't harm the Egyptian position.
And we wish Egypt a lot.
The largest Arab country
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza.
The Europeans tried to save him.
What's happening in Gaza?
If a conference offers support and I consider it a lifeline for the government.
Whether we are invited to a conference or not, we should coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
Rather, it will be released for
The affected parties in Gaza
Immediately, and that was it.
Because it's off-limits from every angle.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you're expecting.
Just give me two minutes.
One minister was boasting about something shameful and said:
And whoever harms Egypt, we'll cut off his leg and break his arm.
Honestly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail; they only spoke about themselves.
What helped them in this matter, and I told our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis' intervention because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To end things in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king says that this is in the public interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for anyone to say that we stopped these people is an insult to those who were stopped.
# **Title:** Our School, Our Safe Haven # **Introduction:** Hello
I believe this.
Maximum limit reached
He thinks he has to assert his strength.
We apologize for this.
If you think that a small state has no rights, its rights are being taken away from it.
And you suddenly enter and interfere in Darfur's affairs.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
African decision and a United Nations resolution
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah is a conspiracy along with Qatar.
A conspiracy of something I don't know about in Qatar.
If there's a new outbreak of swine flu somewhere, Qatar will be blamed for spreading the epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a policy of secrecy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab disagreement
We believe that any Arab disagreement can weaken our position vis-à-vis our major issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analysis became like theirs.
Western analysis
But on a subject we know about, we know what happened in Pakistan.
I want someone to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar offend any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These suggestions are offensive.
I appreciate your greeting us, and you say: "You greet us, you provoke us."
This is a second case, meaning you have a problem or you have a shortage.
This situation doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks his mind.
"My heart, I always say these words."
I always say this.
I always say that even at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say that
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island, but
This issue is different.
From one part we said no, this is not enough, we stop at this case.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
To see where they went wrong.
And seeing our mistakes doesn't mean everything we do is right.
Are you referring to this, Your Highness, Sheikh?
Due to internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and seeks to destroy its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we could, not eighty million.
They have a problem that still needs to be solved.
You played a role in the Shalit case even though you knew this file was important to the Egyptian government.
And I sought help from the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
There's an issue we need to deal with. We said, "Brothers," this issue concerns the Egyptians. They said:
We want to see this matter as a request.
"From Israel and a second state, we want to see a second part, we want to see it."
When we saw this, we told them if the same conditions from the Brotherhood, we will talk to the Brotherhood in Egypt.
And when we announced this, it means that there is a responsible person who can say we, meaning that he deceived the Arab League.
This means he is poor.
How did you let him pass by us?
To keep President Mahmoud Abbas
And we supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I believe this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island as you have accused me.
The island should engage in media competition, as there is a lot of media in the West.
There are many media outlets, and during adolescence they all insult each other.
But after a while, they reach maturity.
It might be or it might not be
Our situation with Saudi Arabia is different from others.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There's also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a difference in policies and viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when the attack on Gaza happened.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And as leaked to the press, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable separation
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it like this so no one interprets it as a no, you're comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Reda among the children
I don't think Egypt is that small, I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for solving the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
I didn't want to talk about divine intervention or anything because only God knows who lives and who dies.
And I claim
He was deceived into thinking there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt.
There has to be a specific way.
Either he stands with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we suffer with him, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States possesses the sources of China's power, the sources of France's power, and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
What's clear is
You're trying
But we're a small country, and I've taken that into consideration.
And I'll repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one says we have any sensitivities.
No one is going to take it from us.
For Israel, you've been tickled now.
"I'll do it before I go to Israel."
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, if I could tell you the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on self-interest, and we do the same.
All complaints and everything.
To destroy the relationship.
I think any great nation that does that will affect its image.
It will affront our Arab dignity if we complain about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there any other steps to repair the relationships?
But I know there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If someone is pulling the strings.
Opposing the consolidation of relations between the two countries and their leaderships, he will find himself on the losing side.
No, it can be tomorrow, or in ten years, I really don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our big sister, but we have different perspectives and we discuss things with each other.
That's all we need, whenever he comes we'll be very happy.
It was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you ask about the number of contracts that were cancelled, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar during the same period.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, last June 4th, your decisions stirred the feelings of the Arab nation when you closed the Israeli office. The news was published in the "Arts" section on June 4th.
Why do you say we stink when we could have shut down 12 years ago if we wanted to?
Since everyone had a campaign before reconciling with Israel and before secret meetings took place between Arab states and Israel.
And after reconciling with most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or above the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we had wanted to stir emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Abdel Nasser hosted a dinner party for the Israeli ambassador, Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended the party, and I don't know why the ambassador did that.
Because in the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small opportunity for a topic about Egypt, but unfortunately...
I was not me, I was you.
My question concerns the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Jaad was instrumental in resolving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran even if its relationship with the United States is bad.
First of all, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this still your vision? Don't you see the agreement as valid, or do you need to come up with a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstandings that had arisen.
But you still have work to do with the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy going there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
**Question:** What's happening in Yemen? **Answer:** A war that has been ongoing for years.
You intervened in the Huthayn affair, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or your involvement puts them face to face with the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
And we suffered a lot, and this is why we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
Indeed, we faced many pressures, but this was our vision and this was His Highness the Amir's stance.
Hot topic
Its stability affects us positively and instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's meant to be used for other reasons.
And we always stand with them in all circumstances.
And it is based on reality.
I think there's no need for us.
We sell them.
I say this with an apology, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, we also thank you for listening, and we hope that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is a greeting from Ahmed Mansour, without borders.
May God bless you.
Dear viewers, peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you, and welcome to this special meeting.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Certainly, why would I say it's a special and exceptional interview? Because...
Qatar and Halla Reem were the official sponsors.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried this when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and Lebanese management from both sides was crucial.
Reaching some conclusions
External intervention is very important.
Too many opinions and suggestions from outsiders.
Lebanese and international Arabs if you want to speak.
It goes through stages, but its meaning...
There's nothing unless these stages are present.
Does this mean complications in Lebanon?
From the time of truth
I mean when you gathered and directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Did you find out that the Lebanese community is very large?
Lebanese Arabic is an international, logical language that needs a large encoding.
Unless it is simple and complex but magnified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many other things.
A Lebanese person can't be talked to.
Impact on peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
Are there external repercussions in Lebanon?
I suddenly decided after twenty-four hours to take everyone on a single plane.
Straight from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They never expected it, they can't rest for even a minute unless you are generous and let them.
The secret is to not let them rest and think too much.
Contact Wade.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you gather them with great difficulty.
And in many circumstances
We left them in this situation to find a solution on their own.
If we want to succeed, we need to get them out of this mindset.
And quickly.
God created success for us through Phoenician eloquence or Beirut eloquence.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believed that Qatar was more biased towards one party at the expense of the other.
And I'm from Beirut.
His Highness's policy if we are intermediaries.
In this process
Frankly
Did you consult seriously?
With the participation of the main parties concerned at least with what is happening here in the Kingdom of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needs a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It was supposed to be cancelled because of the tension in Palestine.
There is the issue of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
Gather, everyone.
And they held conferences to find solutions, so why can't the Arabs, who are bound by ancient ties, do the same?
Unite the Arabs or gather the parties if they exist, or intervene to support the oppressed.
This should be under study.
If we want to send a wake-up call to the Arab world, not to the Arab League.
The Arab League is nothing but a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is Speaker Nabih Berri.
He needs SS.
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
Listen up.
And above them is Qatar.
It never led to any results.
In the interest of the Arab cause
This will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations, when we went to the Doha agreement
"Efforts are made for a solution, and for no other reason."
There's no doubt that
The most important role in the entire Arab world.
Placing
Stand by our agreement.
For others to come and help us.
Because this is dangerous, though.
Why have we reached the point where everyone is playing in our yard?
In our courtyard.
It is extremely important to put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this treaty to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do about Somalia?
What are we going to do about Somalia, as it is not a member of the Arab League?
No Sudan in the Arab League! No Iraq in the Arab League! Why don't we give it a try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part.
I hope this isn't just a suggestion.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that if we're not asked to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his companion is his brother, President Bashar.
Because historically there was an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria.
It's just a passing phase.
And God willing, we will find.
I still insist on the question, if you don't mind, could you take a part in this scene?
Even if it's not public yet, you kind of have the confidence.
What rapprochement between Arab states do we seek?
And this was his policy from the beginning, but this story...
What's happening in Lebanon? Does it indicate fundamental changes in the region?
What happened in Lebanon is purely an internal Lebanese affair.
Belonging to this situation
I wish the opposite, I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It happens somewhere else.
Happy Ambassador, are you afraid of an escalation of an event that happened some time ago?
At least from time to time until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There's no doubt I still have fears about Palestine, especially the issue of Gaza now.
I want to ask
We need something else.
Ask me to focus on the human side in Palestine.
We can't get them medicine.
No food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The one who dies when the power goes out.
I wish
The Arab League agrees on an amount for this matter, food and medicine, we call it food and medicine.
We want the Red Crescent to reach him.
Let the Red Crescent deliver it.
But I'm sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, but I'll say that as Arabs, we need to deliver medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and pledged at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
It's true that we're not dealing with that party because we'll find you a solution.
And I
Now I don't have any clues to solve it.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian meeting in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We might not agree with all of their policies, or they might not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want relations or ties with Israel.
Perhaps some of them think you must be a part of it because of the American bases there.
We know how to deal with this.
Some people said after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia.
He may have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel.
I could say it was a coincidence.
The second point, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was keen to find a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What's been happening in the last few hours?
Change tactics, change negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible for
And we locked ourselves in the room from all sides.
Finally, we found ourselves... His Highness' intervention was very important.
And from it comes the job of intervention.
Without mentioning it, it's over now.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role," as if...
I wanted to take a role without provoking any other party.
Is he Arab, national, or regional?
But still
I became a responsibility.
Do you want that or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
These countries
We can do it.
I believe this will be the profitable combination.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term? Is it ordinary or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
This means that we don't have different viewpoints in some cases.
But this is our right if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How is that possible? How can you interpret it in real life?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Still healthy, but if we're talking politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and this should be clarified in the next phase.
In my opinion, we should set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we wanted to stop the play at the Arab court.
Peace between Palestinians
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective
Thank you, dear followers, for your support. God willing, we'll meet again. Best regards to you all.
Welcome, dear viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their efforts.
Welcome, Sheikh.
To investigate what's happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can appreciate
Highlight some of your questions.
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
And our goal was to be resilient, united Arabs.
Dealing with friendly nations
And our brotherly countries
Where can we find a clear and strong Arab stance from the Arab countries?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our position, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an annoying manner
And no one was punished.
We are accountable for everything, whether intentional or unintentional.
We are the specialized people.
In the world, only those who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in one way or another
I believe
To some extent, I can't.
Gathering at the leadership level
Halting the disciplinary campaign
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
There were five second oral agreements among them.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
Shows that he is right and we are wrong because the goal
Solving the problem is not the pinnacle.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now is that the ministerial meeting does not cancel Qatar's request.
His Highness also affirmed that.
In the speech he gave, we insisted that it not take place in Qatar if it would cause any embarrassment. We insisted that the summit not be held in Qatar; it could be held anywhere.
An Arab stance that others respect us for.
Yes and ministerial
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
I was not involved in the decision, and the killing and bombing in Gaza continued and is still happening.
And I need to ask the Arabs what we're going to do about this issue?
What are we going to do?
When will Israel be fulfilled?
Implementing the remaining Security Council resolutions
Otherwise, there will be a halt because Israel did not stop.
Shooting, we don't force our brothers.
A decision considered final.
A few days ago
We're talking about the ministerial meeting.
You support this in the end.
Certainly, we support holding an Arab summit, it was our idea, and some other countries also requested the summit, Syria and Yemen.
Now she has become a proficient Arabic speaker.
Or classify us as moderates.
And a camp other than the central one.
And what do they mean by non-moderation?
Those were arranged by the West.
Arabs who are coddled and Arabs who are not coddled
You won't find a moderate nation or an immoderate nation.
And we want to know what moderation is and what its absence is. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And I'll close the case in a humiliating way.
Or we just keep the matter open.
This means an important question.
Are they countries?
You follow Israel's plans and try to solve problems in its ways.
I'm not saying that they're following Israel's agenda, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name the camp of moderation
What is the meaning of moderation in the West's view?
Do we agree to the slaughter of a certain category of Palestinians?
Certainly, elections have taken place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a reality that exists.
The truth is that there is
Idea
What some call a radical move
But we need to ask ourselves, what does this extreme action want?
Does he seek something other than his rights, or does he demand his rights?
Don't we arrange them?
And creating other blocks as well.
Against because we
I am an Arab and cultured internally.
And he started to get
Therefore, we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who cancelled the Arab summit?
I can't say it's forbidden, there have been attempts and the subject is almost known.
Prevention topic
Just as I said, it's possible.
Take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that wasn't the point, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, that's what we believe.
While some saw it as not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Is there a Security Council resolution?
But the decision is for the Security Council; Israel said it would end and then return to the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We're not trying to enforce the decision on the weaker party.
What makes it different from the first meeting?
Amendments sometimes cause disputes.
"May" (as
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Similarly, to address the Israeli party and inform them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should investigate the matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four and we are committed to the truce. Eighty-four and the Israelis are not committed.
It's natural for disagreements to occur in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements...
Representing their positions and what's in their hearts.
One of the reported altercations
Someone described Hamas' movement as "scattered."
Not even a little
This situation occurred and we responded to it, and one of my brother ministers was with me.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are radical moves, dismemberment, and other names.
And we don't want to be men for others.
And so it always means and I don't mean anyone by it.
Any foreigner they found.
Western country or Western countries are receiving
Among the Arabs
Present, Your Highness.
A Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
She has only one agenda.
Where are you, Arabs, in all of this, and what is the position of the nation of one hundred and thirty?
One million Israeli soldiers
What was issued following Decision 186
The issued decision.
Israel hasn't carried it out yet, it will carry it out after completing the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
This is what we should be thankful for in this decision.
To demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
When they are asked, they say, "We understand."
What is the fault of the Arabs if they...
If that's the case, Israel won't be held accountable.
And he is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab Summit to what was going to be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try for us.
He needs a tough decision.
The decision is yours.
Causes the official to lose his position.
We were afraid of the West.
And we'll work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who launched the attack to rebuild Iraq completely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
What we ask from the Iraqi government, not the right of the people who died.
No compensation.
The exact same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Your happiness
His Highness Sheikh
A Major Diplomatic Victory for the Arabs in the Security Council
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
What has Israel not committed to?
He will approve it in two days, in a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they didn't commit to it.
Sorry, but people have to gather.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was completed.
Do you have another option for the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
Participate in the siege of Gaza
I am pro-West and I have no objection to having any relationship with the West, and I am not against it.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or you have a point of view.
And in the end, they take one percent from our perspective, and we say we won.
What is victory?
What was it stuffed with?
I can't say anything about precautions now because the decision hasn't been made.
The council is master of itself.
I participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But what prompted you to meet with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State?
But I'm sure the brothers who went are enough.
You pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For two years up to that moment
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend we knew everything.
If they are people to me.
There was Israeli rejection, international rejection, and we also participated in this rejection.
And from here the dispute began and the siege started.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they burned, because we don't want them to seize power.
These parties are called "Hizb al-Sheikh."
The Palestinian conflict is clear and explicit.
I mean, if it were in
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Was there ever a Palestinian conflict?
You can't tell one party that they are one hundred percent right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I don't claim that or say that.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And we Arabs are not only in the Mediterranean, we are also equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want it to happen, so let's end it in any way.
Once, by training the soldiers to the right and left.
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And if we set a positive example in the West Bank.
To show how people live in Gaza
Luxury in living
While the opposite is true in Gaza.
Invited to a second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time.
What people are still talking about is the dialogue taking place between Hamas, mediated by Turkey.
The meeting I was invited to attend shows that he wants to beat around the bush.
It would be redundant to launch another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
With this number
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We ask you to take a role and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
Just important
Don't come.
Tomorrow's party was overshadowed by another party.
No path to agreement.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what's required from Egypt?
The current proposals and initiatives do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or the presumed Palestinian presidency, we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are still people.
Those injured at another party whose perspective we should consider.
So we can make this stage beneficial.
By the way, to take a point of view
Hamás' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how was it issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in drafting without communicating or consulting the main party concerned with the issue.
Just a prophet, of course we deal with the State of Palestine as a state.
And we deal with the authorities as one party.
But now there is a split in one party in one place and another party in another place.
This means that if we deal with people from Gaza, we must stop dealing with people in the bank or in the Palestinian Authority headquarters.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask a person from Gaza to be with them.
And now we'll start coordinating with each other.
What was announced?
Firstly, regarding the resolution, it did not mention a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some considered it a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from what I understood from reading this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in implementation.
This stops the fighting.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider that this decision is no longer valid because Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things on the ground will change.
Yes, Your Highness, in our discussion about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time and
Or an Arab excuse.
Or Arab disputes that cannot be resolved, hence they came to fill a vacuum.
It is supposed to be filled by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A platform that deserves appreciation from Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
People should follow him.
There's no Arabic conscience that can resolve the situation.
They say let them finish the mission.
There must be a clear Arab stance and a clear cutoff to all this ongoing aggression and procrastination.
There will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, we are the ones who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I don't demand an Arab war, I demand a...
A clear Arab stance
Of course, in the context of initiatives and proposals, you are following what is happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
The political ramifications of the military operation will allow Hamas to impose its conditions.
Does it have to be correct?
We agree on this point and disagree on this point.
The second job.
I have no knowledge of these negotiations, as I told you, no one is currently negotiating.
The second job.
Complete in the required places for Arabs.
Arab reality
We witnessed after the start of those operations.
It seems that there is a very advanced position being taken by the Arab street.
As governments, we have a responsibility to act.
Certainly, I regret that some people describe the gift of peoples.
They tell me about this matter again.
Representing the views of the people.
Head of the department
I mean, if they want to.
At least they see what
A request for a high ceiling and a humble one.
Cease normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar to
Closing the Israeli representative office in Doha
Qatar, which takes this stance.
It is taken into consideration that the Arab side should be extremist and take extreme positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon is a collective agreement.
At all, if we had an Arab agreement.
Xi's Treaty and Xi's Relations
We're ready.
Let's go with our Arab brothers.
If there was clear Arab decision and credibility.
They are dealing with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that have none.
This is very important.
Don't be people's agents.
He says, "Why can't Qatar be a role model in this field?"
If this is the only model, we are ready to participate in it.
But we still want
A Qatari Arab model committed to part of his Arab commitment.
Like
No one sells one to the other.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to say our secret, I don't want to say brokers.
That's why it's very important.
For formal invitations only, because we need to rise above this.
Some invited the ambassador, some protested, and some expelled the ambassador like Chavez.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some demanded the summoning of the ambassador and called on the permanent member states, and all of this is theater about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
For high expectations, some call for opening the fronts, and some call on Syria to open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you we demand peace, not fighting with Israel.
And we don't want to fight Israel.
To wage war against Israel.
And how will they agree?
This is after a problem.
What brings us together, what overcomes our differences.
What you said, Your Highness, caught my attention.
This is in the case that countries don't sell to each other.
What do you want to say?
I mean now.
The street won't have mercy on us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what's happening today the completion of a project that began in the 2006 Lebanon War?
Or he is in disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon was a free land.
Some of it, of course, is still supposed to be a deposit for the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon, I mean we dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
To prevail and be the one with the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them and they are foreign.
That's why you want to be the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example to Gaza.
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And how many sides does it have?
In Palestine, there is only one point of view.
But I can assure you again that the problem in Palestine is that they have heard too much from Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the void began, and each one thinks he is controlling the other.
In your opinion, as an observer and follower
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
Do we Arabs accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
He expresses his opinion or states his view.
If Israelis or others in the future
We set a great example.
In obedience and assistance in crushing bones.
We have a moral proverb that says: "Me and my brother against my cousin, and me, my brother, and my cousin against the stranger."
Now, we are supposed to be in any dispute with Hamas, and I'm not saying Hamas or anyone else is infallible.
They all have mistakes.
Now we have to forget about this matter.
Submitted to his authority.
Because here, failure will not be a group failure.
Your Highness, Qatar, which I have been meaning to visit for some time, has been trying to come up with suggestions.
Initiatives to find solutions took place in Lebanon.
We'll talk about what happened in Darfur later, even if you're in a hurry.
We
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are sensitivities.
The country will take all these steps, we don't mind as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a headline.
What were His Highness the Prince's objectives?
One of his goals was to stop the bloodshed.
And they ended the dominance.
What happened was beyond imagination.
And we're in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I doubt it.
But the most important thing is the existence of good intentions.
Reach a solution for the honor.
Our discussion about initiatives would benefit from knowing what has been done regarding the initiative to resolve the Darfur crisis by the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And the focus will primarily be on resolving the Darfur issue, as the Darfur issue is at its inception.
Help the Arab.
But what we heated up on an issue we made international.
On the basis of rejecting the system, and now we want to solve the problem and we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned earlier, to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
Remove the issue of competition in the Darfur case from competition yet?
I don't want to go through that.
Before we conclude the conversation, Your Highness, there is a economic summit.
Are you going to attend this summit?
No, we're going to attend the summit.
We wish it had been held in a different atmosphere than the Arab one, but it was scheduled.
If this happens, it will be a joke.
If the Arab leaders attend this conference, perfect.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza as they gathered for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance in heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know what circumstances might bring. I mean, of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
And to ensure safety
No one takes anyone in their small pocket.
The Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, expresses his sincere gratitude.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, welcome.
What is the usefulness of this celebration and the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
How is our Arab region, and to what extent are they interested in this issue?
They're asking these questions and others with our guest on today's episode.
Former Special Rapporteur on Disability for the United Nations Conference on Disability
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt
And I've held several positions in the disability field.
She was one of the founding members and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In the year two thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
And the vice president of the National Committee for the Disabled since 1999.
One thousand two hundred and three
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shafalah Center for Special Needs.
For People with Disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed to delivering lectures, participating in meetings, conferences, and seminars.
Hello, Haissa, you're with us in this episode.
People with disabilities
Initially, the term "disabled" was perhaps coined in the 1980s or early 1990s.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide this education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
About the duration and before we get into the details.
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries or classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is the strongest in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
A move towards legal rights is present in the Arab world and present in many countries.
It is possible that the resources are available and there is also political will.
Okay, let me tell you that some statistics you might know.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Oh Ms. Hassa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
It's largely true.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas prone to such incidents, which are wars and conflicts.
Here, you can't distinguish between the disabled and the non-disabled because there are so many of them.
Indeed, children with female illiteracy, for example, are almost three or two dozen.
In another country.
There are many barriers that prevent these children from reaching school, even without disabilities.
Indeed, the city doesn't have infrastructure, even if this boy found the school.
What he can reach.
For children and other residents
Agendas and projects are very nice, but we rarely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago. What is the point of this celebration?
State of the world
Better than people who don't have a disability.
In organizations, I arrived and started many projects.
He implements a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There are intersections between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a higher level of awareness in the Arab world.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you
I have two questions I've been wanting to ask her since she was at the United Nations.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against regimes that hinder society for the sake of the child now, such as the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of a regime like what happened in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kro is from Syria, thank you very much. We have Naif Saeed from Kuwait, welcome Naif.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Peace be upon you
Good evening
Good evening and welcome
If you don't mind, I am one of those with intellectual and mental disabilities.
Arabs say, "A wise man understands by hints."
And in the Quran is a verse that says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," Allah has blessed us with speech, so praise be to Him who gave speech to all things.
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
So praise be to Allah who taught me speech.
I meant the Quran and found.
People attack me for quoting the Quran, considering me a hypocrite.
They attack me, not knowing they are at the bottom of hell.
All I got was ejaculation.
And we say the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls within the same definition.
UN programs or what are their reactions to the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
Discussing with them, convincing them, and knowing to what extent.
In their work agendas on disability topics and cases
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already addressed disability.
Any program that tries not to forget children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and excellent schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But we must acknowledge that there is a deficiency, a shortage within the United Nations.
What are the main weaknesses and shortcomings you addressed?
For the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
My work especially sometimes during restrictions or shortages too.
Struggle or attempt to fight for recognition of the disabled.
Until he reached a somewhat satisfactory point, he did not place it in a separate subject as the Global Disability Movement wanted.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
There's no coordination between them, unfortunately.
This is one of his most important shortcomings.
Poll, conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries.
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies, and all were three responses.
Don't give up.
The issue of disability is permanent, stable, and ongoing for many years, even though this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
Recently, praise be to God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and others.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international systems?
For Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this assistance actually reach the disabled?
The final monitoring would not be effective without binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
She asks her to adopt this proposal.
The one who writes directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Move to this box.
A productive or efficient factory
Allocating just one percent of the annual net profit
Go back to our dear guest to answer the callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have surgery but
It costs too much and he can't afford it, how will he help himself?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it is important to meet the needs of Brother Naji.
The rights of people with disabilities are like any other rights.
It is necessary for the citizen to obtain all these rights and duties.
Joining the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
And strive to fulfill the rights of the people and meet their needs within the national scope.
Or even at a non-governmental level
It is binding on all States and must be adhered to in order to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials, there should be awareness.
It has to be at least this way if we work on these treaties like this.
Even if there's no great obligation on him.
Is there any response to the monitoring reports you are conducting and is there any interest?
But don't forget the standards, they are already ethically binding, not legally.
To have commitment and to be proficient.
Recognizing that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or will be in the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Za'arna, Manager, Qatar Center for the Deaf Sign Language Expert in the Arabian Peninsula
First of all, Mr. Ali wants to thank Al Jazeera from the bottom of his heart.
They just broadcasted this episode live.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
And we support her and stand by her always and forever.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them don't know about this agreement because there were no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions.
And it is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with disabilities in all countries of the world.
And I emphasized and insisted on these countries.
Adopted and signed this agreement.
For example, the State of Qatar, and some other countries, signed this document, aiming to serve people with special needs and serve us.
Thank you very much, my colleague Naji, I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion can determine a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A donation box that accepts contributions from any country.
This means that the fund is supposed to spend on the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur.
Even the Arab countries did not make donations except for one: Syria.
Carrying out those duties is a challenge faced by the United Nations, therefore.
The box
The absence of commitment from member states, unfortunately, and the lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people say this very boldly, meaning they don't care about the situation now.
Is there really a question of obligations?
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, especially
But for this reason, there are people in these times.
These countries are committed to their promises, but it's a good idea from the brother.
Above all, it is essential that there be no single independent box, meaning independent in form, but rather existing organizations in the region.
What do they have in their balances?
Special Projects for People with Disabilities in Gaza
Assistants for the Disabled
The issue always involves political factors.
His state or government ensured its support suddenly.
Unfortunately, it reduces the number.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Certainly, his citizenship was revoked.
They took his daughter from him.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
To move or to leave, we are perplexed.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And we can
They rebuild themselves as they learn.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Joy of Caravans from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar welcomes you.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
Sheikhessa Hessa's continued support for them.
Hello, noble standard-bearer from Tunisia.
On another level, it's genetic.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, the uncle always marries his cousin, and so it is always.
In this way, at this level, it's a level of incapability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
Indeed, as you said, on a national level.
I know there are guidance and support programs.
Falls under healthcare services
Those who fall under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I believe in the psychiatric clinic and also programs in the Supreme Council for Education.
Special Education Administration, frankly, I don't know if it still exists.
Of course, within healthcare services, there is support and medical care.
Rehabilitation services are provided for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure. With reference to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage, are there any awareness campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
This is indeed an important and serious point.
One of the things that I and others have dealt with a lot of talk and many contributions.
Yes, in awareness campaigns and more targeted ones.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
For UNICEF as well
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar.
And certainly Tunisia.
Now there is a binding decision for early inspection.
What has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do these campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it goes against customs and traditions.
Of course, its difficulty lies in its collision with societal culture.
I have a decision, I have strategies, I have the will to deal with it, and I am committed.
The issue of early screening, for example, because it is a very important issue before marriage.
Do you have statistics on people with disabilities?
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
For the Arab region
And especially
Regarding the recent events in the region
In disputed areas and regions, especially in wars, conflicts, and other disputes
Everyone dies with three disabled people in them.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places?
No, it's never enough, and first of all, the problem is...
Human rights principles
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Agenda within institutions established in ministries in the government and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or disturbances
Only your words, High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Mr. Ply.
In the world and the strange in the matter is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that the census
To this day, people with disabilities are not included in population statistics.
They don't always announce it.
For example, in the State of Qatar, at the time of the census, I think more than five years have passed.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and
Prepared by the Council as a fact in accordance with the participation by us such as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
Assign more classifications to disabilities.
Things that should exist
Types of those needs, all these important details that you need to reach a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics in progress regarding this matter.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you very much for this program, and special thanks to Sheikh Hessa.
But praise be to God that I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receiving a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Ms. Hessa.
Her motivational role and her role in keeping our children safe from fear and worry.
Praise be to God, and thanks to her and those she relies on from this category.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, with Qatar, with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope she can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
And I bear witness to the special service provided by the State of Qatar for hearing impairment.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Special Needs.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Until civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities gather.
Because reality and what we wish for, if you compare them in five years,
What was available to the disabled five years ago and now?
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan. Now let's go back to our guest.
Certainly
Society as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families who have...
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children cannot obtain documents or other things, whether in Qatar or anywhere else.
An international convention, like many international documents
Commit to translating them into plans and strategies.
Automating these services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Present, Sheikhah Hessa, you previously served as a Special Rapporteur, working at the United Nations on disability issues for six years.
Did you wish?
Perhaps the time wasn't enough or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
"We've achieved a lot, and I'm proud of it."
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and radically.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty to fulfill.
They need to fight for
Many thanks
Thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and letters in a new episode of "Live" with safety.
Good morning
I'm so happy you're here with us.
First, before we start asking various questions and chatting this morning
Thank you, Shaima. Maybe I congratulated you.
The Middle East as a whole deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has left its mark on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Oh, Ali, go away, ah! Ali.
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I extend my warmest congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens for hosting this event.
And, God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and we will start working from today or from the advertising period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, weren't you afraid in this field and on this particular subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I told you Qatar will take seventy percent.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitive.
Why are we afraid?
Alhamdulillah, Qatar's bid was very strong and deserved this.
It's true that the 2022 World Cup file and its hosting in Qatar
What do you think the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, no doubt they are very happy, God willing.
I want to hear %pw. We were talking off the air, but we want to hear it on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you? How did you hear the news? Were you shocked? Tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
Regarding sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and hosting.
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima
I went this time to cheer up Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We had interviews afterward.
We all cooperated, Qatar Today, remember daily.
A hundred times a day, since it's the smallest spot in the world.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by being in the national team.
Certainly, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
I mean, it's positive that one gets tired and works hard.
Being in the league, even when he's in the league, he puts forth his best efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the officials have worked hard in their care for young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Eat, Sleep
Tell me about your experience, playing at several age stages, how was your experience, and which stage was the most important to you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step through the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know about camping with the club and the league.
Every stage has a distinctive mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We're used to you now, sportswoman Lana.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We love to see you and hear about sports from you. So, how is sports going for you?
Frankly, I don't see a difference between this and talk shows. In talk shows, we hosted stars in their fields, and in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and others in their sports field.
On the contrary, the field is active.
We are the capital of sports, especially since we have the best sports facilities in the region.
And Qatar has now become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of offering a variety of talk shows, social, economic, and cultural programs
In different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But after sports
Amazing, wonderful
And God is witness that I wished.
I wish I was ten years old now, not twenty-five.
I believe the young players got a great opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is excellent, Ali. What do you want to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Certainly, I told you it's an opportunity, they should take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
They enjoy a great advantage from it.
Tell us, what have you been doing? What are the new programs you're offering? We know we asked you to come during your vacation.
Tell us about the new thing, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which starts in January.
A few days have passed and we have finished the Gulf Cup. By the way, we would like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The news bulletin is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari TV, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I am grateful for their generosity.
Delivering the media message through various channels
Private channels, neither sports nor others.
I mean, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you success, we are still on the same subject.
I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club first.
And his fans, I was in Al-Wakra Club
My childhood
The sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
He's still at the club.
I'm still a novice in Wakrah.
Just as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
This is the property of every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people love and are addicted to sports.
How do you make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in all the various fields of life.
I said that the youth are addicted to it, as schools have also become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, this reflects the awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the field of sports.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for Qatari players.
I believe that sports are evolving.
I also believe that this period
To produce massive projects and spread sports awareness, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If she withdrew and carefully considered it.
Sufficient and at the same time necessary to be used wisely, as I said.
Also, there is an important point, which is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, including capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's also an important point, Alhamdulillah, we are in Qatar, as you know, all Arab and Gulf societies are famous for their love of sports.
How can we attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending the games at the same time
Most Qataris love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse web forums, you'll find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, what is the best way to attract you to attend, aside from being a sports athlete or player?
How can you get the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there's no general concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering at home.
For example, Japan developed an excellent plan to attract a large audience.
When you attend matches, collect points, or anything, they are looking for solutions, God willing.
and Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar, especially in the year 2022. Lana, what do you think we need?
In addition to financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national team and participate in the global tournament, the World Cup.
Time flew by with such lovely people. When the producer told me time was up, I said, "Really? God willing."
Always achieve the impossible. It realizes the dream we thought was impossible. Praise be to God, we live it as a reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins.
And God willing, the year 2022 will be an event in which the name of Qatar will be raised.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar. Honestly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host 2022
Thank you, Lana, the creative presenter. I wish you all the best, and I will always make sure to follow your shows to stay updated on sports news.
Thank you, for sure happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new type of music that is popular these days.
But in a repetitive way with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a group of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and good morning.
We're trying to get an idea about it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
I do a repeat performance, but not a rapid-fire rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
Consisting of a large number of verses, it addresses many different topics and issues.
Sometimes it can be personal.
Social, emotional, or political.
Often causes controversy.
And I'm quite liberal.
Raps, viewers sing along to the lyrics,
But he keeps doing it.
He praises his voice, which is considered a secondary element.
In general, sound is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or an MC.
Rapper's care about the following elements in songs:
Example flow, flow of sounds, synchronization and performance.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rap.
And I think they'll give you a better idea than me personally.
Good morning, hello.
The first thing was a period when we wanted to do something new.
Being distinct in something.
I mean, we said why don't we rap?
Rap is a present art in all countries of the world.
I mean, why isn't it available in Qatar?
Alright, we said we'd invent something new.
We gave him an idea that contained a message.
We discuss the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
I mean, we convey a message first and foremost, and that's art.
It is an art of diverse arts, and for the record, it has radically addressed many social and psychological issues among youth.
Time passes and changes, and I think this has something to do with the change in time zones.
Before, there was a simple acceptance.
We sing, since about two thousand and five, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in 2010.
More acceptance and popularity.
Have you noticed that people love to sing and perform in a rap-like style these days?
Yes, indeed, a large percentage of people.
There's still something we need to talk about. You were founders in many teams.
A great band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded? How did the idea come to one person to form a band, and how many are there in the band?
Initially, before we formed the band,
Rap came to Doha starting in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can record and release their songs on the site.
I can download, Salman can download, anyone can download, so there's competition.
We met people.
So we started competing with each other.
Then, after a while, after all these years, we reached 2010.
Before 2010, there was a cluster system, meaning each cluster was independent, and every three or four clusters were grouped together.
We said why don't we unite as one group under the name Rappers Qatar,
"Qaraberz" is not a recognized
We agreed on this, we said under one name and one hand we are all.
And we go out and present this and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, a large group.
Now, is anyone of you singing, or, or, or are you all rapping?
Formatting and composing
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how do you arrange these twenty-five? How is this number ordered on the tape?
Each one of us has unique potential within them.
It means that everyone in the band can make a whole song.
Without anyone's help.
But capabilities can differ; for example, if Salman is better than me,
He listens to her and tells me to change her words, change something.
Each one can change for the other.
Let's help each other a bit.
Or a company that incubates you, where an official body incubates these works.
And there will be real distributors.
So that the work turns out in a high-class way and becomes something official for you.
Frankly, we hope to find support and get backing from a label that will adopt us and produce an album for us.
We don't have any problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
Why don't you take the initiative first?
So that an individual can recognize the first CD.
By doing this, you can later attract companies. What do you think?
Almost in 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
Sweet, sweet because in 2007 rap might not have been dominant in the Gulf.
But he wasn't as famous then as he is now.
We were talking before we went on air, for example, in large groups like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about her?
They said they'd organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Honest, we were surprised, it was excellent work.
But there was a bit of pressure because there were no advertisements and nothing before the party.
No ads or anything two days before the party.
We thought no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
This is a beautiful point.
It means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song that the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most of the songs.
Yeah, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The whole group
How are you, how do you deal with different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before *
It has to be this way.
I mean, it rhymes.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Let's hear it and see what the public thinks.
I hope they like the talk.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it mentioned the name of my program.
This is the KWD DJGMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Kai coming, Madame Bobo with SKT one hot on the body.
Don't forget, the show airs at nine thirty, everyone has to watch.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the program's name, thank you guys.
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it yesterday.
And who wrote the lyrics, or is it she?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
Don't write these words just for the love of singing, but also for your passion.
I assume you're writing about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I think you can.
Sure, personally, we'll produce a song about this topic.
No, I don't think it can be formal at this stage.
For I think there should be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, true, today, everyone
We're watching live right now.
The cup has arrived and adorned the streets of Doha.
Viewers, as we've seen, Doha is decorated in celebration of the Asian Cup.
The participating entities have made all preparations for hosting.
And it will be more crowded.
I suppose they'll congregate along the corniche.
I'm sure they're ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up in the next few days?
In an official announcement, they promised to organize a party for us.
Just, wait, there are some complications.
"Some procedures and a few problems, so we're not sure."
We'll try, if you meet Joseph and see.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of implementing them.
When I'm at home.
And then send it to Youssef via email.
This part of the song is dedicated to Youssef.
Is there anything else? Do you travel abroad?
In this field, they have millions of fans.
Don't try to reinvent the wheel, but listen to people who are ahead in this field.
But we try to be competitive.
Why don't we take ideas and imitate certain things?
But bring it back, I take the idea and apply it differently to my song.
Who formed a band and have more than one CD.
A person named Abdullah Al-Dail.
He has experience and the ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
I am one of the residents of Marat town.
There are many experts.
Those who determine the location of groundwater before drilling.
This requires drilling wells in places where there is no water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or tin, through which he can identify water tanks.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced with copper rods.
We placed the two sticks next to each other.
Walk slowly.
We notice, when we walk along the stream.
The sticks will open.
Now, we're crossing a stream of water.
It opens this way.
When we crossed, she started.
Now we're in the middle of a watercourse.
And here, the middle will be.
Thus, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater, underground.
This process is repeated multiple times in different locations to find the spot with the strongest signal.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
In reaching an advanced stage of this profession.
His discoveries are very accurate.
In places, outside places, in Shaqra, Huraymila and Al-Aththiya
More than one hundred and fifty wells were found.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
Requires training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In short, in a short time.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Once upon a time, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We have seen this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we reached different names and titles, but they are all hers.
Meaningful
I assume the presence of a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf countries.
Do you follow specific people and consider them role models?
Follow him instead of imitating him.
In general, there is a connection between all Gulf rapists.
No competition, I mean if I were to produce a song.
This addresses a specific topic.
We call it meaningful competition.
We have acquaintances, but no one is my friend.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He is...
He has fans and CDs.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage? Perhaps you will surpass it and reach further stages, God willing.
We wish you good luck and success in this band.
Here, upon receiving the cup, let's see some shots of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
This, even if borrowed from the West, has a Gulf character.
There are also some love rap songs and a unique band of twenty-five people.
It's important that we stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
I assume you have an email or a website or a forum.
How do people get in touch with you?
We had our own website.
But there are problems with the hosting company.
He would sometimes get drunk without any apparent reason.
So we faced a lot of problems and solved them in the end.
No use, the site is definitely closed.
What does it mean, what are the alternatives, to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to stay in touch with them to keep up with the latest news, as they release songs from time to time.
So what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
What's it called?
Okay, when you search for our name on Google...
Qatari rapper
You can produce your own video clip.
For the program, you worked on it yesterday.
We've uploaded a lot of videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
I think you need to see more improvement.
You need a place that brings you all together instead of having the equipment at each one of your homes.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Honestly, I hope we get support.
Example company
CD production
And he allocated us a special place.
We work by ourselves.
In the end, we're still working on ourselves.
We don't want this.
What differs from Yusuf's speech?
We need a video clip.
And album
Music videos help the song spread quickly.
Speeds up the transmission of ideas.
If there's support, everything comes with time.
And your sweet voice is everywhere.
It is an art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you to Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah for attending.
Let's see it and wish them success from our program, guys.
These projects were, yes.
There's a project that's almost ready, but it needs technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you have the total and all the details.
Knows the goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
While I walk the wagon
Mounted on the cart, you can choose the material you want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's perception of a problem.
He has a lot of activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives that Her Highness Sheikha Moza set when establishing the center.
Maybe later, yes.
He goes straight home from work by underground train.
I just thought it was for clothes.
List all the shops in Qatar that sell t-shirts.
Maybe later you can be with the car key, press the button.
It locates the things I've lost and leads me to the key.
Yes, let's go back to the projects the center is working on.
Early childhood education
Developing skills and nurturing talents
There, it varies between the different children's skills, means, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we've designed a special program to accommodate them.
We started with Future Media, we did excellent work on this project, we reached the end, the project graduated.
We also have numbers of children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have junior presenters?
Regarding television, it is important to provide programs for children.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We prepare them until they reach the age of 18.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is after the national channel.
We need to discover, attract, and develop these talents.
Media, Research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and other diverse fields
Is there any cooperation? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Speakers Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, Generation Exhibition, is also...
The scientific club played a significant role in improving projects and later with technical support.
The Higher Education Council played a key role by supporting schools and partners.
Professor Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
The one who embodies a series of activities and clubs.
Do you consider this a step forward towards success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very spacious place
Dealing with the public is easy.
She is a pioneer and has excellent initiatives.
And in receiving the guest and introducing him to the programs offered to the child.
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted this project and support it.
It's a big project, developing reading, writing stories, and child development.
Diverse cultural skills associated with reading specifically
Sure, there are different programs.
We recently moved.
And we're rearranging some activities.
Design and optimize it to suit Katara visitors
We wish you success, through this center.
This contains very important ideas.
First, I would like to thank you for hosting me.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They treat their children like a hotel, providing them with accommodation.
Or like a bank, provides money.
Children really need someone to listen to their thoughts and imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2032.
In this exhibition
Good luck to the winning projects.
Thank you for your presence, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
To make these projects a reality and not let them remain a dream forever.
Hello ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center opened yesterday at the Diplomats' Club.
Closing Ceremony of the National Exhibition of Dreams of Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and many competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative and Innovative Projects
We welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for giving us the time.
Talking about this exhibition, frankly, it's unique of its kind.
We're glad you're here with us on the program to cover as many events of the exhibition as possible.
This is the national dreams exhibition for our generation.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is the exhibition.
Contribution of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
"Who was"
In an attempt to calm the children
Live the dream.
With the project
This is a project or a dream.
Imagine the kids very happy.
So we made it twenty to thirty.
Qatar National Vision 2030 and other key areas
We started training children in four stages.
Then, think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you want exactly from this sentence?
Facts or the nation of tomorrow?
Means, anything the boy dreams of today.
He arrives as the project reaches its conclusion.
Indeed, this was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children should live from today.
With a big dream
Is it environmental, health-related, human development, or any other field?
This serves the country.
I think because we know there are kids somewhere.
In a private exhibition
All that was available via
Exhibition, there were also guests of honor.
Children learn from them, as role models.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, he was in *
There were two winners from different countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council states.
There was a schedule to present their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
This is the owner of the last project, the forest.
And we also want to talk about the colored ball.
It's a very bright idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this thing, the colorful ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, in four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is the colored ball.
The smart field is also called.
Once the ball went out of the stadium.
Colors differ.
I suppose this will help a lot in future matches.
What after all these dreams?
And he sticks to things related to his field of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects into account from small minds.
But we don't know, maybe these projects will benefit us. What does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of the colored ball.
Is he impressed by her?
Ziyad often visited football-related projects.
He supported and adopted these projects from the moment he saw them.
He also adopted this approach.
Our people have spoken, the people have voted on many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that existed and received the most votes from people?
They have an evaluation committee with a method to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects and the project was ready for implementation.
Certainly, it requires many administrative elements.
He was very detailed in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we're seeing now.
This is part of the big projects.
Maybe they're trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Yes, indeed, part of it is funded by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects. What are these projects?
Gather, Use, and Recycle
From two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
And the university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We'd like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid, and we continue in the same artistic atmosphere. Today we are hosting a very dear guest to us.
From the series "Tisanif", actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani.
Imposes himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent,"
And she worked hard to prove herself in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
What does it mean?
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I admire the show's cast and crew.
We'll see a very short scene from your work, and then we'll start engaging with you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake bisht and keep the real pocket.
Go and see her.
You have the cloak, you return it.
What? Give me the best one, return it! How do I return it?
A goat finished him off in her belly, woe is me.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
In the conference's high committee.
I won't agree with you.
I have no objections.
This is a teaser, a very short clip from Tsaniif's series, whose second part we will watch.
We want to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you explain your roles in the series "Tasanif", where each episode has a different theme?
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I passed by as time passed.
Marat is also famous for the mountain.
The dark-complexioned one whom poets have praised over time.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
It shows how ancient its history is.
Which is located 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And some believe that its name came from Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its archaeological landmarks, the sweetness of its water, and the moderation of its air.
Poets were influenced by her and amazed by her. She was known for her famous mountain, Comait.
They call it Comet's Blessing.
Of course, Marrat City is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam
There were ancient things with an unknown history, like the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we're in now.
Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, a companion of the Prophet, ordered the digging of this well when he passed through during the Ridda Wars.
It's still remaining until now.
The proverb says: "Control your temper, and I'll guarantee you success."
If you see a comet, you'll see a mare.
Another effect is the Comet Valley.
The sweet memories that run through the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season to the next rainy season.
And the date of establishment of these monuments is unknown.
There are still some leftovers.
Jabal Qumayt is one of the landmarks of Murad city.
There were many proverbs and poems about this mountain.
Many people come to him from various regions of the kingdom.
One of its important monuments is the Al-Waleedi Well.
This is because he had previous experience in the Ridda Wars, and he was on his way to Yamama.
He pitched his tent there and commanded the men to dig this well.
A people who perform ablution with its water and still drink from it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed by Marrah.
This is an old house made of mud, restored to its original state.
It consists of various sections that reflect the architecture, heritage, and antiquities of the region.
The poet said about her: "When we met by the water, it was free water."
We crossed the Kumayt stream, not the Anajil stream.
Mr. Ayman, hopefully, there will be cooperation between the family, parents, the center, and also the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally, to run the training process.
Since anything leads us, whether it be the apprentice, the student, or the child,
This record contains all his personal data.
Even his monthly grades, for example, he has an evaluation every month.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he reach it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached since he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a structure.
With Professor Ibrahim, who will be with us later,
We see different models, I wish we had enough space.
But, we got a female model.
You test different tests before going on air.
We'll ask her math questions and various questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back to see this smart girl, stay tuned.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If any show catches his interest from the first, second, or third episode, he'll skip it if he feels he's not into it.
He won't tire himself out; he has twenty thousand second seasons.
Correct, twenty thousand series, correct.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people focus on one job.
Anyone can see the rest of the job.
This is true, this is the majority.
He says that he only watches TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, our dear and honored guest, Abdel Hamid Charshuni.
Would you like to say something to the audience, or to your fans who adore you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, may it be a habit for you.
It's true that we don't go out much, we don't show up much, we don't do much, and the reason I've mentioned.
What's coming is better.
If God wills, we wish you success and prosperity in your endeavors this year.
If God wills, we'll have a second interview with you to talk about these plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are eagerly awaited by lovers of new fashion.
Hello, dear viewers, with us via Doha Morning, and we are live with you.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students enrolled in this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Certainly, they focus on developing other potentials.
And also for their minds to function at their best.
Ms. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Kholguely are the CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome to join us.
And now we have the beautiful wish, good morning wish.
Good morning.
How old are you, my love?
I am in the seventh grade.
Whatever God's will, we wish you all the best.
What are the things we give to our sons and daughters?
This was explained by Professor Ayman and Professor Nesma, and was particularly directed towards our children.
What is the MindMath program for mental calculation?
Finger counting and abacus.
We tried to show a small part of it to achieve specific goals.
Did you notice, Professor Ibrahim, if there was a difference in the student during the first two days?
And after that, maybe three or four months?
Whether he studied at public, private, or even independent schools,
In short, the program scientifically relies on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
What reveals lost potential or the need for continuous development?
Has he reached a certain level, or what updates have there been for the boy?
Okay, we're working on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Some methods and mechanisms that are applied in a regular way;
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Professor Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amany is a student among those enrolled in this center.
We wanted to do this live today to show you, our viewers, the importance of these things.
If you want to return the coat, I don't have any objection.
This is a very fast clip and a small part of a series of classifications that we are watching the second part of.
But as we've seen, this part of the series builds on Part 1.
Can you clarify some aspects of your roles in the "Tasanif" series, where each episode covers a different topic?
This year, focus on "b".
Fadil locked the door.
He encourages by giving opportunities.
Sixteen episodes in two seasons.
Bacon will be a director in an episode, an episode in which there will be an old man and an episode in which there will be a baker.
I mean, it's a collection of diverse episodes.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
There are many actors I can't remember right now. We definitely have actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Rashid and Mohamed Adel's faction.
Tara, surely.
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We currently have a bit of work in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV did its best, but they only produce one show a year and all the Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I replied to you. But it's only one series, and all the Qatari actors want to work on it.
If someone finds a scene, they should thank their lucky stars.
Praise be to God for everything.
Let's go back to your beginnings.

In his plays, we started working with him in the theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdul Aziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
So He it is Who has taken us under His care, taught us, and reared us.
Then, Mr. Ghaniem delved into his life story, exerting his utmost effort, in 2000 in Fayez Al-Toush.

A message from the palm, the date palm.
This treatment has been practiced for a long, long time.
We have a guest.
The exam format is as follows.
It's swelling, the degree of pain.
You feel something like sand or broken veins inside your hand.
Relax your hand.
My brother-in-law has frayed nerves.
You feel pressured and a bit tense, tense.
Left side.
Now, dear viewers, we're examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem will be evident. We already know about the headaches and dizziness he experiences.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means problem.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's sniffling, do you have a nasal problem or any problem before?
I had an operation, but that was a long time ago.
Is it a fleshy gland or something else?
He gains weight without eating.
Present, your left shoulder.
This is because of the nerves, when I told him he had nervous tension.
Ten years ago, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks by the sea, I think it clears up.
Any land that is not level is not just sea.
Negative energy possible %PW.
And you might be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Certainly, children are the most important.
Kids, praise be to God. This is for mother, pay attention to me!

Later, you'll see gases suddenly rising.
What are the discoveries you have reached, Professor Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from rheumatism, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing regarding menstrual pain or period pain in general.
You should focus on one or more stones, by pressing here, you are giving orders, glorified be God, for the waist and menstrual problems. If you have pain,
If God wills, it will disappear in seconds.
Pregnant woman
Delivery became easier for her.
They are neither here nor there, and God knows best.
If they say it's likely to happen on the seventh, you might be able to give birth on the ninth.
Except on sand.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
She should eat seven soft dates for breakfast, as the soft ones are better.
If she doesn't have dates, the dates are enough.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. As said by the Almighty God, I seek refuge
It means that God couldn't get this soft date to her, or rather, He could have if He wanted to.
Praise be to God, and I seek refuge from the word 'I'.
She has to bring a stone or small balls.
The delivery bed. For example, if she forgot and came to the delivery bed, she would hold the handles.
In private hospitals, you'll notice a East Asian unit.
This is something that happens in East Asia.
If you need anything, you have my number.
Just the mobile!
I advise everyone who hears me now to cooperate with each other.
"Purify your intentions and care for people. You were created to worship God, then..."
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
Thank you very much, Professor Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and we also thank our dear guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak more about this topic.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start looking at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
Is the program part of the national strategy to treat, combat obesity?
Four countries among the world's top in average obesity rates are from the Gulf region.
We started a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
I'm afraid of its spreading more and more soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize this competition together, making it an international one.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because this is the first age at which they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about your favorite fruit?
The second week went by.
You need to walk! The more you walk, the more points you get.
This is a map of Qatar. Each time a student earns points, they move forward on the map, and their school and class progress.
A beautiful competition is held among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, he doesn't need to drink Pepsi every time he's thirsty, drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
At school, in games, some of them don't like it.
We're looking for a sport he likes.
So we force him to exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
His family knows that they need to make their son eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take.
Of course, this is just a sample, and God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more active.
We want more games, we had so much fun with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin is better now, the pimples have decreased.
This is true, this is true and it is turning into awareness.
Parents know their children.
And their classmates in different classes, asking them "How are you?" and learning from their peers.
Praise be to God, it seems that many schools are eager to participate from now until next year.
Inshallah.
Qatel Company was the official sponsor in supporting this matter.
We had the Aspire zone which hosted sports competitions and awareness events.
On the dining table.
Praise be to God, thank all the responsible authorities, I mentioned some and forgot others.
Praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And the other, the brothers taught it in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
There was diversity.
We tried to do different types and include as many people as possible.
This is the generation of the future.
To share this experience or spread it on a larger scale in Qatar.
When you evaluate, there's always something that needs to be fixed.
After its widespread use and satisfactory results
If God wills, we will spread because there are people asking why we weren't there.
Eat, eat healthy food and you'll get there, you don't have a problem.
Unless we start young, by the time we reach our twenties or mid-twenties, we'll have already achieved what we want.
Your happiness touched on a range of topics, each group has a title.
If we return, we will try in today's paragraph to speak about the conclusion of events.
And when we mentioned people again in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's repeat it again, what were the information for each week that we wanted to convey to the student?
Okay, first of all, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Each lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
So he starts by loving some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two things, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think that walking is only for the elderly, why should young people walk?
It means when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it relaxes your body and mind.
And it lightens the load on the individual, meaning that the course of clear-mindedness improves.
I took the students for a walk.
Yes, they had to walk whether at home or at school.
They record their points through the class teacher.
From those who walked on it daily.
That was an event; some people held a march, the girls' school held a march.
I want them to like this, I'm creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers need to think outside the box; we don't want them to give them ideas to stick to.
Everyone has their skill in this area.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We always try to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and crave soda.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could find out what his favorite sport is, we could support him in it.
Bacon is interested in sports.
He loves sports and plays them unconsciously.
We said before that we would talk about the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society.
I welcome our dear guest in today's episode, who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We're glad you're here with us at this show.
And some of them are this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
In the beginning, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
It affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The age range from twenty to forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the cause of suffering from it is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, usually the youth.
The treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from all harm and any other illnesses.
This disease is an infection in the brain and spinal cord nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
An alien body is supposed to enter the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
The white cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this protective coating.
What led to the non-arrival, weakness, or interruption of the nerve signal.
Leads to paralysis, God protect you.
No, with the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease so far.
Okay, what's the solution? We want to know how to reach it.
Similarly, one should have protection against this.
The main reason is quality of life, nature of food or life cycle?
What is the direct cause that makes a person suffer from this disease?
Everything we have now is theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve human health problems.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be controversial in one way or another in society.
We still don't know the causes.
Present, the age group that may have this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after reaching forty years, the disease starts to calm down with the person.
So far, we haven't found a cure for this disease.
This is evidence of a large number of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or to speak about Qatar.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics show that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar too.
Recently, just last week, I heard about three or four infected cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, as recorded in the files.
And many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go to other countries for treatment.
Welcome, Abu Abdulaziz. Are there any symptoms similar to those affected by this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they may have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for instance, kills.
We should be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
In providing a specific reason for a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
