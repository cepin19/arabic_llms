There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the deportation to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Joseph was a good man. He didn't want to humiliate her in front of people. That's why he planned to divorce her secretly.
But suddenly, Joseph, as he was pondering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
A son will be born to you; you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All of this was done so that it would be as Allah said it would be. He said it through the tongue of the Prophet.
"The virgin will give birth. She will give birth to a son. And they will call him Emmanuel."
"Behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Mary your wife will bear you a son.'"
But she did not want to have relations with him, even though he was her husband, until she had given birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
"The wise men visit Jesus"
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus was born, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
"Where is the child who is born to be the King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east, and we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this news, he was very angry. All the people in Jerusalem were disturbed.
Herod summoned the chief priests of the people and the scribes, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem of Judah," they answered. "That is what is written in the prophet's book. He said,"
"And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too small to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days."
That's why Herod secretly summoned the wise men. He knew exactly where the star had appeared to him.
She sent them to Bethlehem. She said to them, "Go! Search carefully for this child. When you find him, bring me word. Then I too will go and pay him homage."
And after they heard the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their homeland by another route. Jesus' family fled to Egypt.
When the men had gone, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel from God appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child in order to kill him."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, and he became very angry. He ordered the killing of all the male children in Bethlehem and the surrounding area, who were two years old or younger, in accordance with the time that the wise men had seen the star.
Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah; who had said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and deep sorrow. Rachel is weeping for her children. She doesn't want anyone to console her, because her children are dead.
After Herod died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said to him, "Arise! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Galilee.
He lived in a land called Nazareth. Thus, the prophecies of the prophets about Jesus were fulfilled. They prophesied that he would be called a Nazarene.
"John the Baptist prepares the way."
At that time, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Depart from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John said to him about the prophets Isaiah. He said: "There is a man calling in the wilderness, saying, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothing was made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people were driven out of Jerusalem and from all the regions of Judea, even from the areas near the Jordan River.
When they confessed their guilt, John Falwater baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Don't even think about saying your idea: "Abraham is our father." I'm telling you, God can bring forth children of Abraham even from this stone.
The axe is only under the roots of the trees. All the trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will burn them in the fire.
"I baptize you with water, and I advise you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is stronger than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
He will use the microphone to silence everyone in the house. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the chaff in a fire that never goes out.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop them. He said to them, "I need to be baptized by you. Why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now. It is right for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then the sacred plan of God will be carried out." John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
He heard a voice from heaven say, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
**Jesus is tempted**
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, and there the devil tempted him.
And after forty days and nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered: "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, Satan took Saeed to a very high mountain. They could see all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
He said to them, "If you bow down to me and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Jesus for a season. And behold, angels came and ministered to Him. Jesus began to preach and teach.
John was in prison. When he heard about Jesus, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which is by the Sea of Galilee in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus says the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah spoke.
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land on the seacoast of the Mediterranean! Region beyond the Jordan River!"
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that hour, our Lord Jesus began to preach to the people. "Repent of your sins!" he said. "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Our Lord Jesus chose his first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the sea, as they were fishermen.
"Come with me," said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they opened their windows and followed him.
Walking along, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,
Immediately they left the boat and their fathers, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from great pains, some were possessed by demons, some were violently convulsing, and some were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. People came from Galilee, from the Decapolis, from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and others from beyond the Jordan.
Isa is doing the blessing.
Jesus saw the crowds; he went up the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them. He said,
"Blessed are those who are spiritually poor. The kingdom of heaven is theirs."
The blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who are humble. They will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who seek the truth and thirst for it. They will be satisfied.
The blessed ones are those who show mercy. They will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who make peace. They will be called children of God.
Congratulations to those who suffer when they do the right thing. Their paradise is within them.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you because of me. And blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil against you because of me."
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Paradise is great. This is similar to what people used to do with the prophets before. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
"You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden."
Likewise, people don't make a candle and put it under a bowl. They put it on a candlestick. That way, it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. That way, they will see the good you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
"I have not come to abolish what is written in the Torah or the Prophets. I have come to fulfill them, not to undo them. I have come to give the true meaning of what is written."
What I am going to tell you is true. The heavens and the earth will pass away before even a single letter of the Law passes away. Not even a dot from the pen will pass away from the Law until everything is fulfilled.
Do not break even one of the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. For you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, keep these commandments and teach them to others. This is how you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I am telling you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, or you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
"I heard what they told people in ancient times. They said, 'Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be held accountable for their deed.'"
But this is what I will tell you. Don't be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the fire of hell.
You imagine now that you are presenting your gift on the altar. And you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift there before the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother first. Then come back and present your gift.
"Someone might have a lawsuit against you and take you to court. Try to resolve the issue quickly. Settle it before you part ways. Because if you don't, they will take you to the judge. The judge will involve the police, and you might end up in jail."
What I'm going to tell you is true. You won't get out until you pay the last cent! Adultery
You have heard that it was said: "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But that's what I'm telling you. Don't look at a woman the wrong way. Whoever does that has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your eyes than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand offends you, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is just a part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Divorce."
"It is written, 'When a man puts away his wife, he shall give her a bill of divorcement.' (Deuteronomy 24:1)"
But this is what I will tell you: A man who divorces his wife leaves her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she betrays him. I swear.
Once again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the vows you swore to him."
But this is what I will tell you. Don't make a promise like this. Don't make it in the name of God. This is God's throne.
Don't name it after the Earth. That is the chair of the two legs of God. Don't name it after Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads, [for] Allah is not heedful of you nor does He hear.
"Let your yes be yes, and your no be no. Anything else comes from the devil. Be kind to people."
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"But that's what I'm telling you. Don't fight with a fool. 'If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.'"
If someone takes you to court to get your shirt, give him your jacket too.
If someone lets you walk a mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not refuse those who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard what was said: “Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.”
But this is what I will tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who have hurt you.
"And you will be children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous."
"If you love those who love you, what will you do? Even tax collectors do the same."
If you only greet your own people, what are you doing more than others? Even those without religion do this.
Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing "righteous deeds" in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. Because if you do that, your Father in heaven will not count it to you.
"When you give to the needy, don't blow a trumpet with them. Don't be like those who make a show of their piety. They display their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets, seeking the praise of people. What I'm telling you is true. Give them what they want."
"When you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
And then you will give your charity in secret. And your Father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
"When they pray, they don't act like they're holy. They like to stop and pray in the lobbies and at street corners. They want people to see them. What I'm telling you is true. They'll get what they give."
"When you finish praying, go to your room. Close the door and pray for your father so he doesn't see. He will reward you. Your father sees what is done in secret."
"When you pray, don't use vain repetitions as the heathens do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words."
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you even ask him.
This is how you pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Your kingdom will come. Whatever you want, it will be on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive others for their sins against you. That will make your father in heaven forgive you.
But if you do not allow people to forgive their sins, your father will not forgive your sins. Fasting.
"If you don't eat, you won't be like those who pretend to be holy. They make sour faces. They want people to think they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. That's what they'll get."
But if you walk without eating, you're putting oil on your head. Wash your face.
Even if people don't know that you are fasting, only your father will know. He will reward you. Your father sees what you do in secret. Save your wealth for Paradise.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your wealth is.
"The eye is like a lamp that illuminates the body. Imagine if your eyes were beautiful; your whole body would be filled with light."
But imagine if your eyes were bad. Then your whole body would be dark. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be afraid.
"I tell you, don't worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
"Will adding an hour to your life make you any less anxious?"
And why do you worry about clothing? Look how flowers grow in nature. They don't toil or spin cloth.
But this is what I'm telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like this.
"This is how God provides clothing for the cannabis plants in the forest. Will He not clothe you better than that? Cannabis lasts only for a day, tomorrow it will be in the fire. Your faith is very weak!"
Don't be afraid. Don't worry. Don't ask, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
People without religion run after all this. Your Father in heaven knows you need this.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge people.
Don't judge people. They will judge you.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You only see the chaff in your friend's eye, but you don't see the log in your own eye.
You can tell your friend: "Let me take out the splinter in your eye." But do you have a splinter in your eye?
"What hypocrisy! Look at the beam in your own eye before you notice the speck in your friend's eye!"
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone will receive according to their needs. Those who seek will find. The door will open for those who knock.
"Would any of you give your child a stone if they asked for bread?"
Willa solatya on a fish. Who among you will give him a live one?
Even if you are a devil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How then will your Father in heaven not give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great and most important commandments.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and fire. Many people go this way.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of scammers who come to you like lambs. But inside, they are hungry wolves.
You know them by their fruits. "Does a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs?"
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, but a bad tree can bear only bad fruit.
You can't get good fruit from a bad tree. You can't get good fruit from a bad tree.
Not every tree that doesn't bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You know a tree by its fruit.
Only those who say, "Lord, Lord," will not enter paradise, but those who do what God wants in heaven will enter.
Many people will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many miracles in your name?"
I'll tell them clearly: "I don't know you, strangers. Stay away from me, you evil-doers!" A builder of wisdom and folly.
"Yes, whoever listens to my words and puts them into practice is like the wise man who built his house on the rock."
It rained a lot. It rose to the sky. It smelled good and hit that house hard. But it didn't want to believe. He was built on a lie.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"I missed the train. I arrived late. I missed my appointment and wandered around that town. And I bought an extremely expensive lamp."
Jesus said all these things, and the people were amazed at his teaching.
He spoke as if he had authority, not like a religious teacher.
"Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease."
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to him and knelt down before Jesus. He said, "Lord, if you choose to heal me and make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to help you," he said. "Be made well!" And as soon as he had spoken, the man was cured of his disease.
"And Jesus said to him, 'Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.'" "Faith is the commander of the Roman soldiers."
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded with him to help.
He told him: "Sir, your servant is sick at home and cannot move. He is in a lot of pain."
Jesus said, "I am going to heal them."
The leader replied, "Sir, I do not deserve you to come to my house. But just say the word, and your servant will be healed."
I am an equal man. They send soldiers to stop me. I say to them, "Go", and I go. I say to them, "Come", and they come. I say to the servant of these things, "Speak".
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
"I tell you that people from the east and the west will come and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
But those who think they are of the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness. They will weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus said to the Roman commander, "Go! It will happen just as you believed it would." And at that very moment his servant was healed. When Jesus had come down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
"Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) Jesus continued to endure.
Seeing the crowds that were following him, Jesus gave orders to his disciples to go across to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
A law professor went to see him. He said to him, "Professor, I'll follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another of the followers said to him, "Sir, I would like to go back and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calmed the storm.
Jesus entered the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said to him, "Sir! Save us! We're going to drown!"
"Your faith is very weak! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the wind and the waves to calm down. They calmed down and became still.
The companions were amazed. They said, "What is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!"
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He found two men possessed by demons. They came out of the tombs. These men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"O son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before the day of reckoning?"
Walking a long way, there was a large herd of pigs eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, let us go into these pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and they drowned in the water.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told the people what had happened. They told them about what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
The whole city went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their region.
"Jesus uncovers a man who doesn't walk"
Jesus got into the boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
They brought to him a crippled man who could only move on a mattress. Jesus saw him, saw their faith, and said to him, "My son, do not despair, I will forgive your sins."
Some of the relatives thought to themselves, "This man is saying something very bad!"
He knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil intentions in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that Adam's son has the authority to forgive sins on earth." After saying this, he turned to the man who was not walking and said, "Rise, take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and walked home.
"When these people saw this, they were very amazed. Praise be to God for this power that He has given to humans. Jesus chooses Matthew."
And as Jesus passed by from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow Me." And he arose and followed Him.
Then Jesus went to the home of Matthew and many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard that. He said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Walk and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Jesus and the Question of Fasting
One day the disciples of John came to him and said, "Why do your disciples not fast, while the Pharisees fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
No one puts a patch of new cloth on an old garment. The patch would pull away from the old cloth, making the tear even bigger.
"No one puts new wine in old wineskins. Otherwise, the skins will burst, the wine will spill out, and the skins will be ruined. No, they put new wine in new wineskins. That way, both the wine and the wineskins remain safe."
As he was saying these things, one of the synagogue rulers came and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Our Lord Jesus stood up and walked with him. That's why his disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She was sick and had been suffering from continuous bleeding for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
"I'll only touch his clothes, and I'll get better."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched her. "Do not be afraid, my child," he said to her. "Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the governor's house, he saw the flute players. He saw the crowd making noise.
He told them, "Go away. The girl is not dead, she's just unconscious." But they laughed at him.
And when they had gone out, Jesus entered in. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news of Sheikh Issa spread throughout the entire region. Issa healed two blind men.
And when Jesus had gone on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. They asked him, "What can we do to make this happen?" He answered them, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your belief will guide you."
They had better not find out. Issa warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and started spreading the news. They were talking about it all over the area.
As they were going, they brought to Jesus a man who was demon-possessed and could not speak.
When the genie appeared, the man spoke. The crowd was astonished. They said, "We've never seen anything like this in all of Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." And there was not a word that they could use against him.
Jesus went to all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Our master, send us your field workers for the good.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Hani lists the names of 12 disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After them are Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collectors. And two others are James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The others are the envious ones, and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will hand Jesus over to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go to any Gentile areas, and do not enter any Samaritan towns.
Walking like that, it's like the Jews. Like lost sheep.
As you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Healer of the sick. Raiser of the dead. Cleanser of lepers. Caster out of demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
You have nothing with you in your belt, neither gold nor silver nor copper.
Don't take a bag with you on the road. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or sticks. A worker should only take what he needs.
"Whenever you enter a town or a village, look for someone who is willing to receive you. Stay in that person's house until you leave."
When you enter the house, greet its inhabitants.
If he welcomes you to his home, greet him with peace. If he does not, do not greet him.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to you. If they don't listen, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their house or town.
What I'm going to tell you is true. On the Day of Resurrection, it will be easier for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah than for the people of this city.
You are like sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware of these men, they will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their synagogue.
They will bring you before the governors and the kings because of me. You will be witnesses for them and for those who are not Jews.
But when they catch you, don't be afraid of what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that moment, they'll give you the right words to say.
It won't be you who's speaking. Your father's spirit will be speaking through you.
"Brothers will hand over their brothers to be slaughtered. Fathers will hand over their children. And the children will rise up against their parents and slaughter them."
People will hate you all because of me. But those who endure to the end will be saved.
"Everything I'm going to tell you is true. Right now, I'm traveling from one city to another in Israel, and I won't have the time to finish until Allah, may He be exalted, brings the Dajjal."
"The pupil is no better than his teacher. The slave is no better than his master."
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If they call the head of the house Beelzebub, what can the rest of the inhabitants expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemy. Everything that has a secret will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be known.
What I tell you in the dark, say in the daylight. And what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
"Is it just two chickens being sold in rials? But not one of them fell from the sky without the father knowing about it."
He's counting every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You're worth more than a lot of birds.
"Is there anyone who's going to say in front of people that they know me? I'm going to say in front of my father in heaven that I know him."
Is there anyone who would say in front of people that they don't know me? I would say in front of my father in heaven that I don't know him.
Don't think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace, I came to bring the sword.
Let's not create discord between children and their parents. Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers. Daughters-in-law will defy their mothers-in-law.
The man's enemies will be from his own family.
"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me."
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
If someone's life is about to be ruined, Ella will find them. If someone's life is ruined because of me, Ella will find them.
"Whoever receives you receives me. And whoever receives me receives him who sent me."
If you have the opportunity to welcome a prophet like a prophet, you will become like him and receive his reward. And if you have the opportunity to welcome a righteous person like him, you will become like him and receive his reward.
"Would anyone give just a glass of cold water to a little one helping me? This is what I'm telling you is true. He will surely receive his reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus left his twelve disciples and went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Soloah Isa: "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus said to him, "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen.
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
Were you waiting to see who came out of John's place? Some tall grass blowing in the wind?
If that's not it, why did you go to look? A man wearing nice clothes? No. People who wear nice clothes are in the palaces of kings.
And what made you come out to see? A prophet? Yes, a prophet and more than a prophet.
"Behold, I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me." (Malachi 3:1)
"What I'm going to tell you is true. There is no one born like Yahya (John the Baptist) peace be upon him. But even the smallest child in Paradise will not be less than him."
Since the day of our Lord John, paradise has been entering with force. And those who have strength seize it.
All the prophets and the law came until John came.
If you're ready to accept this, John is the Elias who was supposed to come.
He who has a mind, let him hear.
"Why are we comparing people now? It's like little kids sitting in the marketplace and gossiping about others."
We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance. We sang you the song of death, but you didn't grieve.
John has gone where he neither eats nor drinks like you. As people say, "He has a jinn."
But when he came to people's son, he ate and drank like you. And people say, "This man always eats and drinks too much. His friend of the treasury and "the guest." Those who act like those who act like themselves, show that wisdom is right." Cities don't know how to rise from sin.
Lord Jesus began to speak about the cities where He had performed many miracles. The people there did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"But we tell you this: On the day of judgment it will be easier for Sodom than for you." "Rest for all the weary."
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad. This is what you wanted.
"Papa gave me everything. Papa is the only one who knows the boy. Those who know Papa are the boy and those the boy chooses to introduce him to."
I see all of you are tired and carrying heavy burdens. I will relieve you.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart. You will find rest for your souls.
"My job is easy and my load is light."
"Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath."
On Saturday, our Lord Jesus went through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. They began to pluck some of the heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! No one does this kind of thing on the Sabbath. Yet your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
He entered the House of God. He and his companions ate the holy bread. Only those who serve in the temple are allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It says that every Sabbath the priests in the temple are to serve on that day. Yet they are not guilty.
I'm telling you, this person is more important than the temple here.
It is written in the book: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You have no idea what these words mean. If you understood them well, you would not accuse people who are not working of sin.
Adam was born master of the day of Saturday.
After that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
A man had a withered and distorted hand. And the Pharisees were always seeking a reason to accuse Jesus. So they asked him, "What does the law say about healing on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "Would you not take it and lift it out of the pit on the Sabbath if it fell into one of your sheep?"
A man is never worth more than a sheep! That's what the law gives us the right to do good on Saturday.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It became whole like the other.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, God's chosen servant.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. That's why he left that region. They pursued him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to tell anyone who he is.
This is to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. He said,
Hani Khadami. I am the one who chose him. He is the one I love. I am very happy with him. I will dedicate myself to him. He will tell the nations that everything will be alright.
He won't argue or shout. They won't hear his voice in the street.
It won't break a bent branch. It won't extinguish a flickering flame. It will fix everything.
"The nations will be drawn to Him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought a man possessed by demons to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man began to speak and could see.
Everyone was saying, "Could this just be Daud's son?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
He knew what they were thinking. He told them, "Every kingdom that makes war on itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that has internal strife will not remain."
If the devil drove out the devil, he would beat himself. Why would his kingdom remain?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. And your followers, by whom do they cast them out? They will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
"First, who's going to enter a strong man's house and take what's in it without tying him up? You need to tie him up first, then you'll be able to steal his stuff."
"He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
That's why I'm telling you. It will forgive you every sin and every evil word you've spoken against God. But what will not be forgiven is the evil spoken against the Holy Spirit.
"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who speak against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either now or in the future."
"A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You know a tree by its fruit."
"You den of venomous snakes! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts."
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the good that is hidden within him. But a bad man speaks bad words. This comes from the evil that is hidden within him.
But this is what I will tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every word they uttered without thinking.
"Your words will determine your guilt or innocence." Aya Younis Al-Mu'jiza
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. "Teacher," they said, "we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
Answer: "The devils and those who have no faith demand miracles! But they will find only the miracle of Prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. The same thing will happen to the son of Adam. He will remain in the grave for three days and three nights.
"The men of Nineveh will stand before God on the day of reckoning with the people who are living now. And it will be seen that the people of Nineveh are innocent. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when they heard Jonah's message. And now, someone greater than Jonah is here."
"The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people who are now living, and she will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and now one greater than Solomon is here."
"What's happening? It seems like an evil spirit has come out of a man. It will wander in the desolate areas and look for a place to rest. But it won't find one."
He said, "I'm going to return to the house I left." When he arrived, he found it empty; they had cleaned and tidied it.
"Is it not that the devil goes out and brings with him seven devils worse than himself? They enter and dwell in him. And that man becomes worse than before. This is the case with the people of today who do evil."
And he is sensitive when talking to people; his mother, sisters, and brothers came out. They wanted to talk to him.
Someone told him, "Your friends are waiting outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus said, pointing to his disciples, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
"Everyone does what they want in the sky, it's their brother, sister, or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
All day Jesus was teaching in the house. Then, in the evening, he went out to the lake. He sat down by the water's edge of Lake Galilee.
Large crowds were gathering around. So he got into the boat. He sat in it. All the people were standing on the shore.
Later, he told them a lot of things through acting. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds."
He sowed the seeds in the ground. Some fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. Those without roots dried up.
Some thorns remained in the soil. The thorns grew and covered the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times more than what was planted.
"Whoever has a mind, let them listen."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
"That which exists in the kingdom of heaven, you will understand, because these things have not been given to those who do not deserve them."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given a lot. In fact, they will have a great deal. As for those who do not have this knowledge, even those who have a little will have it taken away from them.
Hani, why we use stories when we tell people. I tell them, "They see, but they don't see well. They hear, but they don't hear well or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. You will indeed see, but you will not comprehend."
"The hearts of these people have become callous; they do not listen, their eyes have been closed. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn back to me and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I will tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous servants wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the news of the kingdom, but they do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seeds that were sown by the wayside.
He kept sowing seeds in them, but there were some among them who would listen and be delighted by his words, yet they would not last long.
But they have no roots. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the message, they quickly fall away.
The ones who received the seed that fell among the thorns are those who hear the word, but then the worries of this life and the deceitful promises of wealth come and choke the seed, preventing it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on the good soil. These are those who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times what the farmer planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "This is what the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man sowed good seed in his field."
But when everyone was asleep, his enemy came. She planted hemp among the wheat and left.
The wheat began to sprout and form grains. At the same time, the weeds appeared.
The owner of the house's servants came to him. They said to him, "Sir, didn't you plant good seeds in your field? Why did these weeds come?"
Reply: 'They're giving us poison.' The servant said: 'Do you want to get rid of this weed?'
"No," answered the landowner. "You'll remove the weeds, but you'll remove the wheat with them."
"Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather this tares. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then, gather the wheat. Bring it to my house." "The Parable of the Tares and the Wheat"
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone planted it in a field."
"Hi, I'm much taller than all your flowers. But I still remain smaller than all the trees in the garden. You should see me standing next to them. And when autumn comes, I stand tall among their fallen leaves."
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."
Jesus spoke to people through parables. He didn't say anything without illustrating it for them.
"I applied my heart to know the truth; I sought it like hidden treasure. I learned of the ways of old, the ancient words of our ancestors, which we were told long ago so that we might understand them. He gave a
After Jesus had left the people and gone into the house, his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the thorns in the fields."
The one who sowed the good seed is the son of Adam.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who are in the kingdom. But the weeds are the people who are in the devil's circle.
The enemy that is going to sow them is the devil. The harvest will be on the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
"They will be driven to the fire and burned. That is how it will be on the Day of Resurrection."
He will send His angels with trumpets to gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. He will separate the wicked from among His kingdom and cast them all into the lake of fire.
They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"And you are the people of God, a chosen treasure, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, so that you may declare the praises of
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, hid it again, and went away happy. He sold everything he had and bought that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a precious pearl."
He met a very expensive one. That's why he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The net's story.
Once again, the net is like heaven. Cast it into the sea. It gathers all kinds of fish.
When they were full, they brought them to the shore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but they threw away the bad fish.
This is how the Day of Judgment will be. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will throw the evil-doers into the fire pit. There, the criminals will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Did you understand all this?" asked Jesus. "Yes," she replied.
He told them, "Every scholar of the law who learns about the Kingdom of Heaven is like the owner of the house. He brings you new treasures from his storeroom and brings you old treasures." A prophet without honor.
Lord Jesus told these stories. Then he went away from that place.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogues, and they were amazed. "Where does this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?"
Aren't all your brothers with us? Why did this man bring all this?
They didn't like him at all. But our Lord Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not respected in his own country. And he does not accept any respect in his own house."
Not many miracles happened here since they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head was severed.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus. He was the ruler of Galilee and the region of the Jordan River.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod will search for John. They imprisoned him, bound him, and put him in jail because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
John was saying to Herod, "What you have done is wrong."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. He was very pleased with her.
He promised her on his right hand to give her anything she asked for.
He said to her, "What shall I give you?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered his promise and the guests who were going to have dinner. He then ordered one of his men to give it to her who asked for it.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
He poured the milk into the big bowl and gave it to the girl. She took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. That's why he went by boat to a secluded place. When the people heard this, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "It will soon be dark. Send the people away so they can go to the villages and buy food."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves and two fish."
He told me, "Bring them here."
Jesus urged the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left.
The number of men who ate was almost 5000. Many women and children ate as well. Jesus walked on the water.
Quickly, Jesus had the disciples get into the boat. He sent them to the other side of Lake Tiberias. Then, He dismissed the crowd.
And after he had dismissed them, he went up into the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was too far from the shore. It was tossing in the waves due to the wind blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and screamed. "It's a ghost!" they cried, terrified.
Now Jesus cried out to them, "Be of good cheer! I am He. Do not be afraid."
"Master, is it you?" asked Peter. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come," and Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out and said, "Lord, save me!"
Quickly Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him. He said to him, "You of little faith!" "Why did you doubt me?"
As soon as they boarded the ship, the winds died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived here knew Jesus. That's why they sent a message to all the neighboring villages. The people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They would ask him to just let the sick ones touch the hem of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "nasty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem to see him. They asked him
"Why don't your students obey what the elders say? Your students don't want to wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commands of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said, "He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not want to honor their parents with their gift. You are trying to make God's word of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying,"
"These people praise me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their religion means nothing to me; they only teach man-made rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the people to Him and said, "Hear and understand.
What doesn't enter your mouth doesn't shame you. What shames you is what comes out of your mouth.
Then the disciples came to Jesus. They asked, "What did the Pharisees think when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There is a class of beings, which neither did my Father sow in the earth, nor did they spring up by themselves, which the reaper does not gather, and which do not perish. They are the children of God."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. How can a blind man lead a blind man? They will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand anything at all?" asked Jesus (peace be upon him).
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart. That's what makes you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart, like murder, adultery, and sexual sins, as well as theft, bearing false witness, and slander.
These are the same impurities that they cause you. But eating without washing your hands does not cause you impurity. "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus departed Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly."
Jesus said not a word. But his disciples came to him and said, "Master, rebuke them, for they are shouting at us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"And no soul can die except by Allah's command, at a decree determined. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him thereof. And We will surely reward the grateful."
Respond: "No one takes their children's bread and gives it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him. They brought with them the blind and the lame, and even the crippled, the mute, and many others. They placed them before him, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who couldn't speak started talking. The disabled were healed. Those who couldn't walk started walking. The blind could see. That's how the people praised the God of Israel.
That's why Jesus called his disciples to come to him. He said to them, "I have great compassion on this crowd; they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they will collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed so large a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to those present, "Sit on the ground."
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Afterward, the disciples gathered seven baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who died was 4000. Women and children died in equal numbers.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowd, he got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
They entice him with a miracle to appear.
Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer: "At night, you see the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after signs, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And leaving them, Jesus went away. "The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must have said this because we didn't bring bread with us."
He understood what they were saying. He told them, "Your faith is very weak! Why do you talk to each other about bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of broken pieces you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves of the 4000? Don't you remember how many baskets of broken pieces you gathered?
How could you not understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
"Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, "Who do people say I am, the Son of Man?"
"Some say he is John the Baptist. Others say he is Elijah. Still others say he is Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"And what do you say about me?" she asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered and said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I'm telling you. Your name is Peter. We will build my church on this hill. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to paradise. What is closed in this world will remain closed in paradise. And what is open in this world will remain open in paradise.
Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer much from the elders, priests, and scribes. He must die and be raised again on the third day.
"Sir, this will never happen to you!" Peter said, pulling him aside and repeating it to him. "No, no, this doesn't exist!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he wants to fix his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
"Why would it benefit someone to gain the whole world and lose their soul? Or what can one give in exchange for their soul?"
God will come with all His power. His angels will come with Him. And He will give each person their due according to what they have done.
"What I'm about to tell you is true. Some of those standing here will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus changed.
After six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James. He brought them to a high mountain by themselves.
Here before them, his features changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white like light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And God sent down to him a luminous cloud, which overshadowed them. And they heard a voice from the cloud saying, "This is My son, whom I love; I am well pleased with him. Listen to him!"
And the disciples said this, and they were silenced and fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise, do not be afraid."
And they, looking up into the sky, saw only Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way, Jesus told them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked: "Why do they say that Elias should answer first, according to legal experts?"
Jesus answered, "It is true. Elijah is to bring everything new."
But I tell you, Elijah is coming. People don't know him. They did everything they wanted to do to him. In the same way, they will make the son of Adam suffer.
The disciples understood then that Jesus was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
And they were going to the assemblies, and a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, was there. Peter went to him and said, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed." Immediately he got up.
He said to him: "Sir, have mercy on my son. He dances a lot and suffers a lot. He will fall into the fire or into the water."
I brought it to your students. But they couldn't fix it.
"Oh people, what is this disbelief and evil within you!" answered Jesus. "How long must we remain with you? How long must we bear with you? Bring this child to me."
Jesus said to the demon, "Come out of this boy," and it left him. He was healed at that moment.
The disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, "Why couldn't we drive out the demon?"
Respond: "All of this is true, but your faith is too weak. Faith the size of a mustard seed is enough to tell a mountain to move from here to there, and it will move. Nothing is impossible with faith."
(No
Gathering in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The children of humanity will be handed over to the hands of humans."
"They are going to kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." After hearing this, the disciples felt deep sorrow. Jesus paid the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. And when they had come to the house, Peter said to him, "Teacher, do you not pay the temple tax?"
"Ah yes, Kidair," he replied. When Peter entered the house, Jesus began to speak first. "What are you saying, Simon?" he asked. "Where do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their children or from others?"
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you." Jesus said to him, "Truly
"But we don't want to get angry. Now go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find the coin you need inside. Take it and give it to them as payment for my tax and yours."
