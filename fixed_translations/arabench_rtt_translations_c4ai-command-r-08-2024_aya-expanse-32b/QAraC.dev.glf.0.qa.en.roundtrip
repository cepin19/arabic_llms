If my brother is blind.
He refuses to better himself and improve those around him.

No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street

And you're hungry.
Are you eating or not?
No, I'm eating.
Tell me, did he accept it?
Your husband is too old to accept this.
I don't want it anymore.
This is our chance, our cars are shamefully old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are ordinary and common.
Stupid! Lacks self-confidence.
Ha, scared?
What's making me feel suffocated?
So he's in charge of the budget.
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden underneath.
I have the right to take the money.
Are you working in another ministry?
Oh my god, how could you forget!
And today in the workshop
Means I'm going to
I consider myself a participant!
It's no use my not taking anything from him.
I won't take anything?
That means I'm still participating.
We all should take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
I'm telling him.
The good that you reject.
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like others do.
Provision is about to come.
Take your share.
He had only one riya in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the last third is plunder.
His son is Salem.
Went to Souq Waqif
One lantern costs eighteen riyals.
Priced in the budget
One hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
You get bored of him.
Seek refuge from the devil.
Yeah, but I think he changes his mind.
God willing!
He is the chairman of the board and everything is under his control.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We need to be together.
A government project like this is an opportunity.
Sure, Oh! Ali
We can't do it without you.
Don't be afraid, Ali!
And if God wills, everyone is included in the project.
Certainly
Yesterday, I was chatting with my four friends.
From your side
We're not afraid because you're members of the project committee.
You are worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't be afraid, Ali!
Tell your friends not to be afraid.
"By God, Abu Fahd?"
This is good news.
Just oh! Ya Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
A good deed matches the first.
I'll keep an eye on him.
I was wondering if I'd get some benefits.
Is it possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it stays a secret between us.
And you found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Sure, I'll do it.
Good appetite.
What's wrong with you?
If you keep daydreaming like this,
It's not going to happen.
This isn't going to work.
Any questions?
We're happy to help.
How are we going to get our rights?
Or is this logical?
Call it!
We're not the only ones taking.
Each participant pays their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We're the ones who set the budget.
How is the land that he bought today?
Has he met him yet?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
He called me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's wrong with you?"
Inform your brother.
That's the second earth.
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He said to call him to make sure he wants it, I'll reserve it for him.
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What about our money?
We consider ourselves partners with him.
Even if we weren't involved!
You're eating a big mouthful by yourself.
Give your brother and mother at least a little.
I didn't come to beg you.
We are partners in the project already, we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when the sultan came and asked for his share, he refused.
But you didn't agree.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee
I heard him talking to them.
They let their brothers and friends enter.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't want limited money only.
Equity capital
If his brother Sultan wishes to attend the committee meetings, he can.
because it seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you.
Yes, Abu Saleh.
Your husband's brother!
You admire him.
It provides a benefit to the project.
We remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh!
I'll be responsible for cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Oh people!
Claim your share.
I, by God
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want in the way you prefer.
The most important thing,
We're still here.
Even during this week,
Everyone specifies the amount of money they want.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
I'm asking for an additional one hundred thousand.
Okay, but why?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your work in looting and pillaging, ignore him.
There are also the orphans' funds.
Increase the budget.
Many people want to eat.
Where does he see himself?
What is this! Is this your father's project?
Yes, this is Sultan.
Oh brother! Oh Sultan!
Which means he is participating.
Is this the family name?
Your friend Saud mentions many names.
He keeps adding names, saying, "Let's benefit from them."
So what group do I add it to, a percentage or a monetary amount?
No, put it with the beggars.
"How much are you allocating for this! Give him twenty thousand."
Yes, enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
Okay, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be part of the first-phase budget.
As a group, no one will notice.
I, after the list that my mother sent.
You call every two hours and add people without asking.
Haha, may God prolong her life.
You are the apple of my eye, my child.
May God protect you, she is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
%pw You're welcome, I told you that's the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
What! What patience, patience... How much is enough for you?
Enough for the liver, accommodation, and hospital!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
You're going to plant a lot of liverworts!
One, but my sister is expensive.
Yes, God bless you, add her name to the list.
Hussaina, yes yes Hussaina daughter of Hilal.
Will you give her some of your money?
Reassure him and tell him that I'm not taking anything from phase two.
Ah, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Wow, they're going to give her a new liver transplant!
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
2000
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mama.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll talk to you later.
The number of people eating from the feast increased.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
You are free.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They are deciding that the project will start tomorrow.
And they keep giving us installments.
His shape! We want to know!
Do you give it to us all at once or in installments?
Why does she get more than us?
There's an electric shock or there's looting, it doesn't matter, the most important thing is that we stay quiet, we're waiting for them to come.
He told me to stop talking, so I stopped talking.
Don't be ashamed.
If I hear any of you speaking
Sew his mouth shut.
They kept us locked up for a very long time.
You know this is money, it's not an easy topic.
How long ago was it?
Fifty million
It looks like you're taking a big bite.
You're the boss after all.
We don't want a headache.
They agreed on the budget.
Professor Saleh, from your presentation about the project, we noticed that it is very exciting and important.
And it's not just for this generation.
Yes yes
Tomorrow will be the inauguration of the first phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you once again.
And I am welcome.
On this occasion
United Nations
Where? For the project.
Where are we now!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
Don't you see the officials speaking and the people applauding them?
We are at the official opening, what do you have?
Present now, speak, that is, we are entering the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people sweat.
And these divisions, I don't know what they've put inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These barriers are the infrastructure.
Official Opening of International Beaches
The third century after two thousand, what's wrong with you?
I don't know, really.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they isolated me.
He just needs to park his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it with my own eyes, there's a big farm over there.
Alhamdulillah, you are comfortable.
You receive checks while comfortably at home.
Why are you bothering yourself, Munira? Don't let anyone mess with your mind.
Oh Manira, you must thank your Lord for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Sakar.
Consider your portion and invest it.
See my friend Hessa,
Her brothers don't give her a single rial from her father's inheritance.
We don't do that.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't trust us!
I don't know.
I don't feel comfortable with my brother Rashid's talk.
He's trying to remind me of the check they give me every three months.
Just, this is mine.
He always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Money worth must be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
Do you know what he does to people?
And Umm Salama is a role model for you, the poor lady.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money ruins people.
But business is business, and it's your legitimate right.
And then?
And we run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headache.
She said she was a wanderer, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister seemed to be spinning.
This is the problem.
You're planning to get us into trouble.
It's our kindness to give her money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We should find a solution to this problem, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity I receive every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
No one invests their money wisely.
Saw, saw, saw, saw
Clear
Clear.
They said they would give her a raise so she would feel happy and stop asking.
This is true, everything I said is true.
Give it to me little by little.
If I only saw their women.
She has a lot of varied diamond jewelry.
I don't have half of what they have.
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
This is your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are stealing from me and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is unpredictable, my dear.
They torment me, make me tired, oh my darling!
Don't they know there's an account and punishment?
And indeed, Allah will punish them for taking people's money.
And be careful, don't tell them anything about the court, okay! My dear
They will be happy.
Is it because of our large number?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a building.
I just want what's rightfully mine.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
Donate to the poor.
Mother of two salamanders
Calm down a bit, my dear!
And we won't tell them anything about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Their rights are stripped.
You were inquiring with the accountant.
A little from you! Ask him.
Answer them!
I am not ... No, I'm here for your sister.
The door you entered from.
Don't frown.
Do you know the door you entered through?
No, no
No falcon.
Alas, Saad.
"Ma noor, don't get yourself involved."
If you want your share of the company and properties, we don't have a problem with that.
Seven hundred thousand
She was comfortable throughout her life.
I'm sure she's his evil wife.
As it is good.
I felt myself begging them.
It is a well-known and established law.
He tells me either take six hundred thousand or nothing.
There is no more justice.
Expect anything Oh! Munira
My parents' company
Eight buildings
There's no need to mention lands and houses.
And he says only six hundred thousand.
By signing the waiver document
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper, be careful, I warn you.
You have the right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else, there's nothing wrong with that.
But the company,
You are a partner
You were just fired from the company.
No one can stop us.
Do you know what?
Is this your father's company?
Don't you see him screaming?
Let me in, I tell you.
Leave it, it's not needed.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's lying to us, make him shut up.
We apologize.
My brother Saad went to the office and explained it to them, but they didn't understand.
Dush joh
See if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink.
Please go ahead.
Certainly %pw
It'll lead us to disaster.
Pedare High School
He said that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
We calculate it.
In sixty-nine months
This is the subject, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million, five hundred twenty thousand
Normal, what's wrong with it?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
This is our money.
Everyone who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, welcome to your company, don't worry about what happened.
Welcome
This is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser has.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, go ahead, you don't need to ask for permission for anything.
Thank you.
Trust in me.
Take his soul, take it.
Let him see all the files.
She has to take more than ten million.
What they mentioned until now
The poor used to say
It's her father who went.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is larger than the second one.
God protects us from everything, He is the guardian, my son!
What they're doing isn't fair.
Don't leave them alone.
What should I do, Umm Sulayman?
I have to sue them, there's no other solution.
Looking for a few sheets of paper.
The case has been postponed.
Beware, my son, Nasser!
Don't mention anything about the court.
Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you!
Rise up, O Mother of Slaim
Go to your room.
All the Muslim patients
He didn't tell me.
Excuse me, who is speaking?
Ah, now I remember you, Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
Yes yes yes yes
About what, brother!
Never mind, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy!
Do you think that this Abdullah whom you sent to them can?
Is he a close friend of Rashid's?
Zayn knows him, for years.
Do you believe Monira?
Even Abdullah, he advised me.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
What is it to people who live seventy or eighty years?
This is for people who live at least two hundred years.
Mother of Selim, may Allah have mercy on her.
God have mercy on her soul, she always used to say
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do they have to be embalmed to go to court?
This is it.
Yes, my love, are you sitting with them?
Tawfiq
By the way, he's a friend from school days.
Life is short.
And I ask for your benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
Deeply rooted.
Ya Rashid, we are friends.
Go now before I change my mind.
Unless you get hit
Go far away, forget about friendship.
Are you coming out or what?
I paid one hundred and ninety thousand on a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get all this money from?
They waste their money on their women.
And she deprived her sisters of her wealth.
Do you have hope, Nasser?
Fight with you.
When I spoke with him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you to do.
Well-known and deeply rooted people
Why not?
Okay, I suggest we go after that.
God blesses this conversation with these bright faces.
Oh Lord, enlighten our hearts with that which is good for our worldly life and our hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than the issue about my sister's share, go ahead.
True
"Go away, it's better for you, or you'll get beaten."
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
What matters to me.
I'm going tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Do not listen to her.
He doesn't go to court.
Early tomorrow
I'll give you a chance to see what you do.
Goodbye
Being kind doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
Let's see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to sue them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, as we will go to her place tomorrow.
What is this?
You're right.
I asked why?
You want to go to court and invite us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, she did it.
# Oh God, I hope your life is sweet.
Live your life fully.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
Upon arrival, park your car first in the parking lot.
You see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Business cards of all the lawyers in the country
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here to laugh at us.
She's going to sue us.
The spirit of the court.
Manar heard.
And sign the surrender document for us.
What's beautiful?
Do you know the way?
We showed you the way.
Come on, dear.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is Al Raya daily newspaper.
In an excellent article available.
A woman wrote this text, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to see, a gift *from me*
His living conditions need to change.
This is a flaw.
He has four children, but his home is unhappy.
Certainly, he risked all his wealth.
Invest in this project.
The one I never expected to start a project is Bou and Walid.
Eat, eat, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid.
My love, do you want to eat something?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, grab some fruit.
Oh, mother, I want a toy like Hamad's.
Bon appétit
Oh my son, Waleed, put some sweets out for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed. You deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Oh father, when we become big merchants, I want a private room for myself.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll get you a large BlackBerry.
Forget their desires now.
Just like everyone else.
Instead of our miserable little house
First, let's pay off all our debts. Then we'll see.
You look very happy, Abu Waleed.
Eats more than before.
He is a trader, may God succeed him.
My father's merchant hair.
**Congratulations on the project**
Save some for my friends.
If God wills, God bless you.
I met a Japanese person, he was one of them.
While we were sitting, I switched places with him, he gave me a gift catalog.
Then one of my friends saw him.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like that.
These are computer labs.
Press the cinema.
If you want a playground..
This is magic.
They were amazed, they all said "Yes."
I took a loan from the bank, some of my relatives, sold my land, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has approved,
Why didn't you ask for it since the ministry approved it?
Then an email will be sent to the factory.
He'll let you know when he arrives.
Thyme tea
No, I'm still sitting in Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, brother.
And stay away for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Are you a fully authorized manager?
Why don't you go to him to get his signature?
I told you he can't.
It's not just him, all the employees there do the same thing.
Appearance can sometimes be deceiving.
Thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Are you done?
How can I finish it since Bu Fahad never shows up?
What should I do?
Then I'll lose my money.
His father signs as quickly as possible so we can finish; I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say you're his secretary, what about us?
And give me your mobile number.
What is wrong with you? Please sit down, sit down, what is it, what's wrong?
Don't call, you're scaring people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Abu Fahd.
%pw, My money for fixing the toilet.
He is eccentric.
Oh people, wait, wait!
Hadi, Hadi,
He told you to shut up, period, shut up.
Bu Fahad had to go to the airport.
How did he manage to do that?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
May God help you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear!
He's just acting strange.
And when he receives the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs it.
Where is he now?
What do you want?
Here, in front of you.
You call me at midnight.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
What's in my hand, my daughter?
I know, Dad, but it's not fair.
The class will be next week at the university.
If I don't register, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months will be a waste of time.
My love, I'm trying!
Don't you see me going to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
And I'll stay at home.
I don't understand!
Don't call during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
Inshallah, Boufahd will sign the papers this week.
And they give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
Woke up in a panic
He walks around and talks to himself all night while sleeping.
If it weren't for Fahd's fall,
God helps him.
Therefore,
Bu Fahad needs to sign this paper this week.
What's he waiting for?
He shows up to work once in a blue moon.
And he traveled for a year.
Leave people alone.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how?
Is your condition better now?
Shatter me to pieces
This strange heat is drawing me, pulling me.
What does he want?
I heard I'm going to the ministry.
Prepare my transactions.
He told them he was punishing me.
And now the time will be up.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
This is Bu Fahd's secretary.
I want to tell you
Buhoth will come tomorrow for sure.
As soon as I call you,
Come directly.
Good luck
I was never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your phone screen
I said, "Alas."
Until you feel responsible.
And if you adhere
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen cartons of printed paper.
Fifteen cartons of printing paper.
He is poor.
The manager punishes him.
Come with us.
Have you heard about the factory?
He'll lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes and tells the manager.
Hell, yes, tell me
What if the manager asks about him?
I'm done with the subject, let it go.
Bu Waleed
I'm going, but I'm waiting for a call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, my people! Wait, my people, wait.
How do I know where you're going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley
**T
Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I have lived my entire life as a messenger, from many years ago until today.
Where have you been, Abu Saeed, for so long!
What were you thinking?
Perhaps about fourteen years.
Messenger
This headache!
Sweating without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike was easy before?
With a yellow flag
It was a very difficult time, oh Abu Saeed!
Alas, oh! my son
What can we do, we are children of Adam.
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry guys, the manager has arrived as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived, Salam, beautiful, let's go.
A thousand congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son, Khalid, got a job.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Pigeon thief
I told you the day my last son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Alhamdulillah, I finish my work.
Served properly
Thank God.
Change your mind, Abu Saeed!
And you deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz!
I am truly grateful, oh! Abu Abdulaziz
Hello
We did our duty.
Let them finish the trip.
This is your right.
After all these years and struggle
Everything comes and goes quickly.
You need to rest, oh! Happy Ramadan.
After I leave here, my wife is calling me.
Retirement celebration
A coffee pot and dates, what a delight.
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry because of the khonafrush, ah! Bou Said
Don't be afraid.
Ready-made carpet
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the cannoli is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your transactions now.
This is your chance to present it today.
He told me that their manager is traveling.
I don't have the motivation.
I don't want to move until
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye.
Congratulations to me.
No overtime.
That means you're free, dad.
Okay, please, Dad.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zohra is throwing a party to celebrate her son's passing of his exams.
She bakes a cake.
I can't.
I myself sent my father to get my papers done.
Flower gets sad.
Okay, Mom.
My parents quit their jobs.
God helps him now.
He has done his share, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook him some kunafah.
His presence.
I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Now it's your turn.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
I made the old woman tired.
As soon as he came back
He was tired.
Don't bother me about them (singing)
Don't bother me about them (singing)
I want to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said he would punish anyone who was late.
Sure, my love.
Go to your job.
In this nose, and with those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
Sends you to a place every day.
As You Like It, Happy Mother
Relieves
Inside my nose
Coward sells cowardice.
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, dad, take it to the market branch.
Go there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there, and they tell me he's not here.
Goodbye, take care.
I got sunstroke.
The sun is shining.
I entered my neighbor's house.
The maid saw me.
She asked me what's wrong with you?
How did they force you to do that?
No, Umm Saeed, I can't eat khanfush now.
Oh mother, where is my father?
Of the spirit and the response.
She told him which bank to go to.
They told him that there were some missing papers.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Oh mum, we attended a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, better?
Sleep a little, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
They are poor, O Umm Sa'id.
They have to stick to their job, they'll be under evaluation, what can they do?
As you like it.
Bo Shahin
You could say I retired, but I didn't.
Why like this?
Before, in the past,
Misery is written for me.
Your children are grown up.
I need to help them.
They tell me
You're wrong.
Do you think that all young people without a father do not complete their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to take time to finish your personal work.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the coffee shop behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin?
I'm going to finish some paperwork for my son, Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this cafe.
Taking the land administration's right
Goodbye
What's wrong, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.
This is what will help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I care about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent.
And we don't talk about it.
They warned him, "Fear God."
Your loud screams woke me up.
Oh father, I was a government employee and know well what storage means.
They are writing this first.
And now they do this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Okay, my son.
You believed his lies.
He says he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong with you?
%pw, as you like
Go now and finish your work.
There's nothing, there's nothing.
He has been silent since he returned home.
What comes back to me.
You have no shame at all.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If we agree on this.
"Wide and gives you vitality" Note: The
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling his maid?
You are the most respected one among us, father!
I am grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me teach him a lesson.
And from now on, my boy!
And relax.
Khanfaresh Khanfaresh (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, O Father!
May Allah reward you with the best.
We've decided from today onwards,
We'll do our papers ourselves.
Thank you all so much, may God reward you well, praise be to God.
Just a moment, please!
She was the last one.
I just can't.
Call me now.
Oh boy, I'm not going to the meeting, I hate meeting the minister.
The minister is angry with you.
No, no, no, you can't upset the minister, you have to go, even before he arrives.
I'm not going with you, what should I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider it done.
You'll be on your way once you finish Saeed's paperwork.
Please, Daddy
Consider it the last favor I'll do for you.
I am happy to serve you, father!
But your son is supposed to sign the paper.
Do you mean for me to come back tomorrow to give it to you?
I advise you to return it today.
And when they see the papers
We wait two months.
Give it to me so I can sign it and I'll give it back to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and ask him to come, just two minutes.
Finish him.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Speaking friend, where are you?
He says he's with Saeed.
I'm waiting for the working hours to end.
Alright, man.
Why did you come to finish your transactions yourself?
Why didn't you send your kids?
Do you have sons?
Are you well, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
Selfish
Go to the old people's home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you telling them, Abu Saeed?
I'm writing something else.
Amen, praise be to God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
My sister, not much.
Why bother?
I told him never to appear on television or radio.
These "anti-corruption" lectures are taking us into problems.
God guides him to the right path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God protect you.
Did he go to prison?
I was traveling.
What can I tell you?
Tap on the app called Mailas, I think.
Talk to the man.
Khaled Jassem
He said to him, "Stop corrupting."
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
And even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
No one from his friends.
Those who encouraged him to do that.
He left it.
God guides him to the right path.
Excuse me now because I have to go cook.
Hello anytime.
Bring it, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and fed up with this situation.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, mom.
I'm sorry I found out this happened.
I told you about this.
What is this, Mother?
And he screamed.
This is an engagement.
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't be afraid, mother.
Let's just not talk about it.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
This is hard for me, after all these years, to be kicked out.
What are you hearing?
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, correct.
You are a rational human being.
They engage in public affairs and criticize.
Well-informed
We bought a few kilograms.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
My brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Abu Manira, didn't find out about this.
He's been angry with you for a long time.
Who knows?
If he asks you
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they'd fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Certainly
Her mother has to say today.
What do we do now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
Whatever you see is right.
I'll give him two weeks.
But if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divorce my daughter from him.
Drink your coffee.
You only spin around yourself if you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to leave.
You are forbidden to go out.
I know you're very eager.
Go to a coffee shop.
Until you talk nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
If God wills, I will wake up early.
Oh mother, I told you, I've quit that habit.
I swear
Oh mother, frankly, I'm feeling a bit bored.
Don't philosophize and be realistic.
Pretend to be deaf.
Change.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your lectures on fighting corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
This is Saleh!
Surely sleeping
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the coffee shop.
What did he say?
Do the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it is your fault
It's his fault that he didn't stop you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Whether we speak or remain silent, do we stop corruption talks or not?
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
A righteous man stops corruption.
Professor Saleh, you are a good citizen, your patriotism is high.
We can't hire you.
What should I do?
Excuse me.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming. We appreciate it.
By God, not much.
I yearn every day to hear him say, "Stop the corruption."
You are a very brave man, you're not afraid of anything.
Say it just once.
God bless you, I
Is it a cigarette? Just say and stop the corruption, please.
He's begging you, just do it for him, just once.
This is fantastic.
Now, my love
For the job
You are a loyal citizen, and you are very dear to us.
We'd like to speak to you to inform you.
He was making a scandal in front of people for you.
Are you joking?
They all said there are no vacant jobs.
They want to hire me, but there are no available jobs.
And now, how are you going to manage money for you and your mother?
And don't forget this.
And she has four children.
May God help you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'll take any job, just for you.
I won't say fighting corruption again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
Just you, you never listen to me.
God guides you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister is thinking.
Surely he thinks about her like that.
You're right.
Okay, it's serious.
We need to do something.
They say he's going to replace you. You know such a rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind them.
I agree with you.
How do you feel?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh stopping corruption?
Lives in my neighborhood.
And he will do this thing.
We miss your voice.
No good
I am a big fan of yours.
Saleh is a very kind man.
God willing, soon.
Let's go back and enjoy hearing his voice.
Bo Fahd is inquiring about you himself.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you leave?
I had problems, health problems and psychological ones.
Frankly,
You are diligent.
I have never heard such a thing.
How sweet, may God keep you safe, Saleh.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about him.
Salih says he agrees.
No, guys, it's too difficult.
What's wrong with you?
The rail is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I had already left.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
"Get down on your knees and make him hear your voice, and I'll ask him for a job the next day."
He's doing your homework for sure.
I want your benefit.
Do you know what?
He forgot it, the soul of the house.
No, no, no, we don't want your help.
Come on, man, wait. Let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay.
Alright, if I speak for the last time now, I've left but I'll do it one last time.
What does Bu Fahd want to hear?
What is the problem that concerns him the most? You know, there are many problems here, a lot.
What does he prefer to listen to? Not the commotion, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Eighty-seven centimeters = Bear
Destroy it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is number seven? Seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Issue Seven, His Excellency the Minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
His brother's car garage
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, let's reconnect with the program.
"I am from a dear people, meaning, this is the last time."
Because, frankly, I had left.
Oh Mother, you said he resigned, and you stopped him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man who was said to stop corruption was talked about on the radio.
What I heard, but some people told me.
I'm sure one of the ministry exposed her.
He turned red with anger.
He's free.
Alright, Your Excellency the Minister
Don't be afraid.
My daily routine is dedicated to serving the ministry, may God bless you.
Heard?
I only said it for you.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdulrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Bu Fahad's secretary.
And I know about the subject.
They used you to achieve their goals.
And unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
Was behind all this story.
Bu Fahad will never hire you.
I'll do the same to him.
As long as I'm known.
No one will hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow to get a divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't want to.
We never have problems.
We are happy.
What does nepotism mean?
Everyone is standing in line.
Because that's the system here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We rely on foreigners.
We don't have this.
Your effort and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Important official
And your turning away
We don't have this here.
My regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Known as the Corruption Stoppage
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running and pulling at my shirt, tearing it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Waleed was wearing the T-shirt we just bought from Villaggio.
He pulled it with envy and tore it to pieces.
He has a kind heart, he can't bear to reproach.
I believe.
You there! Adel saw my son was handsome and envied him.
What he has is
Why did you take off Walid's shirt?
I saw him wearing a new shirt and felt jealous, ask your father to buy you one too.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you.
Don't make me hit you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face and mess up his looks?
He's a small child, not your age, be ashamed of your face.
Is this a boy?
Yes, a child.
People need to raise and fix him.
Not only the left
Beware of your words, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, you fix me.
You are arrogant.
"My child is beautiful."
And if you can't do this
I respect him.
I don't want to upset him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adel hits Waleed again,
I'll punish him.
It's me who wastes my time arguing with you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools
Where did the past days go?
And the intentions were clear.
Sorry about that.
Do you have a bigger one than this?
No, no, this is the biggest one.
Leave everything and come now.
Come see the mess we're in.
Oh, my darling, just tell me what happened?
My brother Ahmed, I'm sorry, I have to go home. There's something urgent and I have to go.
Adoul's pants are gone.
He is a resentful and hateful person.
This... this is Sultan.
How is the boy going to cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I have not used them, God is sufficient.
I am bored.
Sit down, listen to me.
If I go and talk to him, he won't confess. He'll say, "This boy..."
What can we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yeah, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
Just tell me.
Where did you put the scissors, dear?
Under his bed.
They destroyed it, may God destroy their lives.
Just show him.
I won't be silent.
He is crazy, crazy.
Currently
And do not change it.
But computers are a different story, I'll show him.
I won't be silent.
Do you think it was our son Adel who broke their computer?
Tell him to come, let's see what's behind this story.
No *
Go mock someone else, maybe one of your friends, not me.
I told you it's Adol.
And laugh at others, oh Cheetahs!
Hey, come here please.
Their hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm going to go look for friends.
You're laughing at me, no, oh my goodness! Sultanu
You're accusing me falsely.
Hold this pair of scissors.
Make yourself comfortable.
Hello, Abdurrahman, come quickly, my son!
Come see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, oh! my sons
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We should
Zayn thought about our actions.
And the actions of those before us
We see.
It serves as a lesson for us.
We should learn from them.
Don't behave like that, children.
Its size is like that of a camel.
Do you have kids?
Without knowledge
You are his role model, not them.
His father is his role model.
You, O Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
I shook hands with him.
We haven't forgiven each other.
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
"Abdulrahman's endless chatter."
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Have you made the tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
You didn't tell us what Abd al-Rahman Salih meant to you.
Okay, by God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
Bouré, hold the tea.
On his head.
Quiet, quiet, enough! You kids, no shame, hitting each other.
You're behaving like children, stop it, my sons!
I swear I'll show you.
Hit him, hit him, oh my son, what a big belly!
Blood, mother
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God!
Leave us alone.
Shame
Even though I reconciled you.
I won't leave you.
When night came, he reconciled them.
He didn't have time, oh! My daughter.
Oh my goodness!
Inshallah
Speaks fluently
Enough, oh! Girls
God guides you.
Calm them down a bit.
Don't provoke them to fight among themselves, girls!
What's happening? God willing, it's good.
Oh, how disappointed I am in you, Abdurrahman!
I want you to help me, not act like you're doing me a favor.
Oh wise brother, may God guide you, my son.
Two hits in a row.
*Reach out your hand*
Shame on you, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Oh, wow! Officer, we've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were stoning the three.
Excuse me.
No *
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
Means very far away.
My brother was right when he said I was crazy.
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed that your children won't do it again,
Thank you, thank you.
Hello, brother, hello
Officer, how are you going to get them out? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is the assistant manager an undersecretary?
Al-Wasatani is the head of a general authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and go to sleep.
Benadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
Allah suffices against the enemy.
Allah suffices against the enemy.
Allah is sufficient as a protector against the enemy; they only weary me.
What is this? * What is the percentage of PW?
He throws the child away!
This is a man's hand, it looks like it's his father's.
Do you believe it?
He seems to be from a respectable family, quiet and polite.
I come from a poor family.
What did I see?
He is following you.
He doesn't take his eyes off you.
And it bothers you.
And you say you don't have a chance.
When I passed by, she saw you, what does this mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same moment.
No, but there must be something.
I notice when you enter.
She seems genuinely happy.
Go ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, believe it or not.
Too romantic
Come on, guys, it's the 21st century.
You're very desperate.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we last sat and talked like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to spend with you.
Just go rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were tired, long hours, I told the secretary I didn't want any press or TV interviews, no contracts.
I want to spend time with my family.
May God help you.
Even if you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have his number, I'll call him today.
And what's the delay?
The villa has now been sold, and the owners moved in a few days ago.
You were busy with series and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them; we don't interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's wrong with him?
This car, my boy, stops every other minute.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
"Sufficient for you is the reward from Allah."
Anytime, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Okay, enough.
Take it.
What's your full name?
Rashid Abdullah
Name yourself?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
The neighbor before the house.
I want to take a picture with me.
Let my colleagues believe me.
I can't believe our house is right next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Talk to him so he believes.
How long is this life!
What we used to see on TV
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor has changed, praise be to God, praise be to the Lord!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but guys, ease up on me a bit, I'm still not quite used to it.
I heard about him.
Wade was very kind from his side, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
Make sure that some of the employees will be transferred to the new branch of the ministry, in Dakhla.
Did they tell you who's walking?
I didn't hear the names.
Okay, what I heard and am sure of.
This is Abu Ali among them.
My name!
We just don't know exactly who we're passing it on to.
I can't go, God bless you, it's too far for me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, it's all business, my friend.
The committee is still studying the subject.
But if they chose you.
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Waleed, please come in.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Please forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We are like one family.
This is from your kindness, Abu Waleed.
"Your reward is enough for you, O Lord, O Father of the Child!"
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God keep this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I'm ready to go around the market until you find furniture that suits you, is nice, and has a suitable price.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you before.
If you need anything
Treat me like your sister.
I will never shed a tear for you.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to ignore her when she called me yesterday.
Because it tires you.
No more.
I'll talk to you later, goodbye.
Indeed, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't be afraid, mother.
Just wait a moment.
Just wait a moment.
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her.
I told you.
No, it's okay, Mom.
And you come and ask me to propose to you.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you'd like to have dinner.
God willing, the driver will take her to university now.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Where is this car, then?
And God willing, soon.
I called to thank her.
Oh good people, you love goodness.
Yes, you're right, Father!
Even our relatives won't do this for us.
Sure! Is my name there?
Are you sure?
What a disaster! Why do problems keep chasing us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, after hearing this news, what I'm going to do, I don't know.
Go, go, go, go, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What's wrong, Abu Ali?
The committee met today.
And the list of people being transferred to Duhan.
My name is included.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it's helpful, oh! Mother Ali, I don't think it's helpful.
I spoke to him, he said there's no way.
Famous actor
Imagine if your name wasn't on the list?
May you be well, many thanks, Abu Salem.
If you don't mind.
I want to take a picture with you so I can show it to my children.
My daughters will be happy.
God have mercy on them.
Can I take a photo with you, actor?
Sure, God bless you.
Come on, God bless you, come.
Sure, I'm happy to help.
You and everyone you love
Let me know a day or two in advance.
Oh Mother, get ready.
Ready? Ready for whom?
Are you crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said, "I have no objection."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
Enough, oh! My son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
It has to be trendy.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You've put me in a problem.
Why are you taking out all these jewels? I've never seen you do that before.
What suits me.
Mother of Ali
Mother Ali is serving her son.
You want chic clothes and jewelry.
You want to show them that they are well-off people with money.
(Surprise) God willing
Lucky she is.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and bluer *a bit*.
Inshallah, I hear.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You need to be ready.
They ask you to meet her father.
I'm not going in this outfit.
When I put on my new clothes
Mom, take care of her things.
Many thanks to Umm Waleed for her generosity, so use her things carefully.
Yes yes
We have to be like them.
Why, didn't his mother go to arrange his marriage?
This is for women.
I have to go and meet the guys.
As you can see, God bless you.
Just the bisht that's left, please.
Oh kind people, help me.
They were helpful, but the pesht is what's left.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the look.
All the people stand for your sake.
Oh, come on, Brother Rashid, should I just leave it like this, or should I hold on to it?
No, look, first
Press this button
Takes my breath away
The dress is loose, but
May God help you.
The left hand must be inside.
The right hand unclasps, thus.
Hold onto the bisht from underneath.
Wow, wow
How sweet!
You need to slow down a bit.
Ah! Yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand like this, left, like this.
Do you know my friend, Aisha?
What's wrong with her?
Do you know what she was telling me this morning?
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be apart."
I'll ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask his sister and put her in an awkward position.
I see a lot of suitors interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Saeed wanted you for his uncle, and today, this one wants you for his brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I just sit and watch.
Do they know about our relationship?
No, they just know we're colleagues.
Okay, enough.
They need to know by tomorrow.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I'm screaming
My son Waleed refuses.
Actors are truer than you, O Double-face.
Just you
You act your whole life.
This reflects your personality.
Serving people
Disbelieving people.
Wearing costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while appearing on television.
You or me!
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Play
Get married
What scene?
A man walking in front of his wife.
He wears his keffiyeh on the side of his face.
Doesn't turn right or left.
She reminds me of your friend you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
"God protect him, oh men!"
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the city center.
No, no, no, no, it won't be nice while you're sitting.
You look sweeter when you're awake, get up, get up, get up.
Please, Thursday!
What's up, are you going to the center?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife raises his blood pressure.
Are you satisfied with that!
Ah! Thursday
Turn it on, and if the host is a woman...
I change the channel because I'm afraid it's giving me a headache.
I swear to God I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my work friend.
Speak to her.
She took the phone from me, take it, take it.
She hung up the phone, now she's going to make me suffer.
Now you're saying I made you talk to her because there was a woman with us.
You can throw me out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first one to get fired.
No, no, no, I can't, oh brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
He entrusted me with the task.
She told him not to shoot.
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you looking for something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You're completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's happening.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem is particularly one of the best men in our town.
It is he who asks you for a divorce.
If he asked me for a divorce, would I be stupid to agree? That's unreasonable.
Thursday, I officially went crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
God guides you.
A poor man, heart-wrenching.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?
No, nothing, nothing at all.
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
Regarding the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you? Aren't you sleeping today?
Hello, Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm talking to you with full awareness.
Oh brother!
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we erase your name?
The only one who can remove your name is His Excellency the Minister.
This is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Who was that girl you were talking to?
Safe and sound, peace be upon you, indeed he was safe.
If you were talking to Salem
Do you speak?
This time, the lie won't work.
Don't lie, God! Khamas
You're not telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
What is this poor life?
God bless you, please call Salam.
Please, for your belief.
Will you call him?
None of your business.
Mind your own business, or you'll see something you won't like.
And I'll complain about you.
Hello?! Hey, you!
How do you bear living with a wife who has such a long tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hasan is going to call Khamis.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
We start
We hope he finds it.
He was shocked when he saw the women.
You searched the whole ministry while you were hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh my God! Thursday, how do you know your wife?
I'm afraid to call.
*Oh my God*, do you want her to doubt me? Don't you understand?
If I don't answer a call, how will I go home?
Does your wife call you at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large.
The project your company is doing for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh people! Why is the table shaking?
No, I'm long-lived, not the table.
Can you answer the call?
Who is this?
Excuse me, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted from fear and went home.
His brother came.
Tell him that his wife told him not to come home unless he changes his job and doesn't work with ladies.
Therefore, he sent a message to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it. What more does he want!
What's wrong with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him who he spoke to.
I told you he's crazy.
Good evening! Your children's allowance will be returned tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
No matter what you did, why are you afraid to go home and see your kids?
You want official proof.
Alright, give her the papers.
Okay, that's what I did, I sent the paper with his brother.
Until you see the minister's signature and confirm it.
Insha'Allah you will agree, and if you agree, Insha'Allah I will be back home tonight.
Oh sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
An office and a job different from the one he used to work in.
Where is this section, please?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister's statement.
No, no, this, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad, and Abdul Qadir, God willing, the office is big, yes.
Goodbye
Why are you requesting a transfer?
The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can enforce a decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh brother, make a deal with your colleagues!
Hello, Mohammed! How are you today? I wanted to tell you about
And we added two more for the new employee.
The new employee, she is an employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office referred a man who works with us.
Are you kidding!
He looks funny, poor guy, working for five women, he looks funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of other women around him.
Blind envy
Poor thing, he needs it.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, we agreed and didn't speak.
Ay, Abdulkadir who is with you in the office.
See if it fits you.
My son called, said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Walk straight, the first floor is on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With the fifth ***
These are six employees.
And here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't help me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because I'm sweet.
May God guide you, Sultan!
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
Oh my uncle, I was at the bank with Saqir yesterday.
This project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important work meeting today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
Dressed, equipped, and ready to go out.
Indeed, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
Scorpion stings are painful.
This is important for rain, see see.
Look, my uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
The meeting is postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And it's necessary to implement.
They must know that you are an important supervisor.
I have a lot of responsibilities and commitments.
They consider women as servants.
I haven't seen people hate women as much as they do.
How old do they think they are living?
They asked me not to go to work today, and instead go to the kitchen to make tea.
Where are the servants?
And the second fled from a week.
Even the servants couldn't bear their mistreatment.
I understand them.
May God help you.
There are few categories of banknotes.
Tea
My uncle, he means that
Indeed, a villa complex without a garden is nothing.
Alright, now, the park...
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My love, Fatima, I have to go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And I hear it at school.
A committee from the Women's Association came today.
The school chose my name to join the association.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league?
If you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You're the reason.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? I haven't seen you in a long time.
A year has passed now, a year since I saw you.
Are you married yet?
Oh God, guide you.
What would agree to marry my mother who has no certificate?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's my mother, he's a man.
And Khamis was born in Aqrab.
The sting is painful.
He should marry someone from the same social class.
A scorpion like him.
May God help you.
What should I do, Aisha!
Ever since the minister traveled, all the documents have been reaching me.
Inform Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet with him the day after tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
And now I am free to speak with you, Oh Aisha!
Yes, Mary.
Present, here, present, I'm coming now.
"What should I do, O God! O Aisha"
My brothers are the source of all this trouble.
I don't know what happened.
No problem, my love. The snow is good for your face so it doesn't get puffy.
Didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about the subject?
She went to them, and they beat her.
Do they know if I tell them it's a football?
They would have killed you a long time ago.
Something embarrassing, playing football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Identify who is speaking to you.
The big spider
This little thing
Oh, come on, Uncle, I didn't hit her, it was Sultan who hit her.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and politics.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's your turn.
You had your chance.
Do not be greedy.
Okay, scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the Scholarship Department.
Architecture
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Sager.
They don't mind if you take Mona.
What else do you want?
Yes, our Thursday deserves all the best.
I'll set up a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to accompany the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
Just give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
I'll tell you the truth,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's true.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I'm surprised.
They're still paying off their car loans from my salary.
And I'll take care of the house.
She wants to take me with her.
Aren't we getting engaged this week?
What do you want to say?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
Done, let's go
This is a flaw.
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh, my son! I've told you again and again.
Why don't you go?
I'll go tomorrow.
Whatever, since he's a Scorpio.
Appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
Go to the kitchen.
They placed it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't beat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and serious about her work.
What's your opinion on this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
Long life
Serve coffee there.
Her happiness
May God keep her for us and grant her a long life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Honor.
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And then
We will play in China after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister, Mary.
Going to the formal event.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Hello %pw
Yes, Madam
Cast and mold a new one.
Connected actors
You know, after Mashael called me a while ago
What should I tell her?
This is unfortunate, Ron's role is not suitable for Mishaal.
Noof is sixteen years old.
And it's clear that Mashael is in her twenties.
Okay, why don't you take Mary's role?
It suits her more.
"Nouf is thirty."
We need to get rid of the critical person on the committee.
It's a problem, I'm sure it won't let it go smoothly.
He is precise.
He talks about art, family values, moral art, content, and more.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hamed can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company was founded under the name of Hamed's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about it.
Are you, frankly, afraid of the committee chairman?
The last word is mine.
No, no, guys, everything is fine, come in.
I just spoke to them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to decide whether to approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
And it is produced by the Modern Touch Institute of Arts.
A sweet, strange, and bold series.
I agree with Hamed.
The storyline of the series is very nice.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
And she sought to hide the weapon, so she placed it in the car.
And I didn't know she was his mother, it's scary, and when the police came.
Her children came back from school.
And step on the box.
So he trod on it with his foot, and it flew into his mother's net.
This is the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
Praise be to God, a local company produces this advanced level of output.
We need to encourage and support them.
Professor Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinion and thoughts on the series, this is "conscience extortion."
Human values blackmail
Surprising disgusts
One and a half episodes
The second half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
What carries a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why do you have to make the viewers cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
We've given our opinion, Ali has given his, now let Mr. Rashid give his opinion.
Clear from the meeting.
In an agreement between you
You put it down.
Some people understand this and it's their specialty, while others have no interest in the field.
I don't agree with this series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said, "This is from Madame Samira."
I don't know what to do.
How true! Ah! Nasser
This is the logo for the new series we'll be producing soon.
The one who drives rapes the girl.
For the blessings we have received because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
"How are you?"
So they present it in the name of Hameed's wife, who sent you the ring?
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
This is a nice role.
You just played a similar role, haven't you seen "Lost Dreams"?
On the road.
It's called "blackmail," something I don't remember.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
All the series last year were about girls.
You notice that every Siriel has more than eight or even ten daughters.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are precious and beloved.
You're lucky.
Yes, Omar.
Okay, okay.
Sorry, my love. I have to go to work. I don't know what's happening there.
Eat and walk.
He said he wants to see me about an important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
He said to him, "You annoy me."
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
The minister's office called and they want to meet with me.
I'm afraid the minister will believe him.
I'm going to meet the minister.
The man came to explain his point of view about the series.
This is all.
This is true, may God grant you a long life.
Your Highness, I would like to say first and foremost that it is unacceptable to speak about your colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He is jealous of everyone around him.
All he cares about is material gain.
But this is his specialty.
But, God bless you, not every educated person can handle these technical matters.
Especially television productions.
The extorted conscience, the series we're working on.
Mass production
We are taking a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your specialty. You know more about it than I do.
I promise you an amazing series.
This will defend our name.
See what the journalist Abdul Hamid wrote, listen listen.
Similarly, one of the actors said:
The series promotes unethical ideas.
This is confined to the decline of morals.
This is indeed a bold and powerful critique.
They'll be in big trouble if journalist Abdul Hamid keeps writing about them.
And if the people I hold accountable find out.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle her.
They are a big family.
We need to create our own website.
And I put all the activities of our company on it.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are a media advisor.
An extortion serial supervised by the Mercury Media Production Company
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries moral values and ideas.
This is a series aimed at developing society.
This is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How could he accept this?
The journalist Abdelhamid and his likes
Don't be afraid, Professor Hamid.
When he asked what I thought of the series, I told him it would be the best series in the Arab world.
Inshallah
I feel like our series is going to be a hit.
I don't know where he is.
One of them is packing the bags and ready to leave.
"The beginning of joy is the relief of the heart."
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
It's clear at first glance.
Your book is stupid.
*Mumkin yusir* (Possible to happen)
Your serial is messed up, messed up.
What do you think?
It's so tragic.
Bad TV series, second excuse is none.
I can understand this output at first sight.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, you need someone who focuses to discover them.
On the one hand, it's a political drama.
It's a shame she was seen.
What's wrong with him?
I wasn't that nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is angry, that's a big problem.
In just one week, we'll all be expelled.
How is this failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
Tell him the series is a failure and there's no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen up! Eli
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
To me, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that didn't just criticize the production, but cursed it.
Don't make me angry.
I'm sorry.
On that day, I was on vacation.
I won't allow them to write this.
But honestly, I didn't receive any encouraging message.
Once again, great success.
Goodbye
Oh Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
"The Conscience is Blackmail" is the best TV production.
"It prolongs your life, they have an agreement."
Listen to what the second newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an understanding with the viewers' page?
I almost had a heart attack.
After a while, they told me.
You're lucky, the minister is happy.
Really, Nasser?
Be ready to watch "Conscience Forced 2".
No, no, no, no, enough! Oh brother!
The series, he said he wouldn't write again.
Prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Problems
A third and a eighth of a violin
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can a magician do?
I wish you more success.
Tell us what you think about this success?
I thank God for this success.
Envious and adversaries of our success
I'm surprised by this.
This TV series wins awards, yet it's a failure.
Only they are the experts.
They awarded her for it, they must see something we can't see.
Get ready for a second season of the series.
May your life be long.
A real wizard.
"Blackmail of the conscience"
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and cleaned.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch
They nominate him at Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it, award it, and even consider it high-class.
Yes, that's right.
As long as the judges are the same producers.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your arrival.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We're not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We don't go down.
Unless, I terminate the contract.
We signed the contract yesterday.
British Company
Cup and why not?
As you like it.
Did a weird job
He will be the first in the world to produce this product.
Who is the best baker in the world?
I'm telling you.
How does bread get holes in it?
Open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and it might hurt your hand.
So he baked bread with yeast.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
I saw what, in fact, is a bag of bread.
How do we unzip this?
So, you can tell your friend: "I ate two zippers."
Why weren't the hospital sweets distributed yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make it.
Once again, use them at the baker's.
That's what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time on football and delaying my work.
Your son likes football.
It's fine, what's the problem if a few employees from the company have some fun?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven starting players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you angry at him?
It's okay now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and they are the 12th player.
I'll let you enjoy their company.
And we've already signed a contract with them.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
I heard you.
Didn't do anything
No, you're upset with him only because he had some employees play football in front of him and have fun.
I said that some employees can't be replaced.
Even if some of your friends need employees, you can lend him a hand.
"Important bakers"
Oh my son, why take the bakeries, it doesn't do any good.
Next time, inform me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi do this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they inform you?
I finished my work and I'm getting into my car.
Nasser knocked on the door.
I went to him.
He said they didn't find the goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
Durolna, the goalkeeper, said, "Then we arrived at the stadium."
Wear the goalkeeper's clothes.
I've never played soccer or touched the ball.
This situation
This thing is strange.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain it to you.
Oh boy, you want to disband and dismiss the team, right?
Yeah, right.
Oh, please, God bless you, I beg you.
I can't let the team down, tomorrow's the final.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
A thousand congratulations on the victory.
A thousand congratulations, Professor Nasser, on winning the cup.
We want to know how you planned to win.
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach is exhausted.
In a hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as we promised.
Your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he's just putting on an act of kindness and politeness.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, we'd like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakeries.
For such a resounding success
"May God bless you, no, no, no"
No picture without a flash, wait, wait, hold still.
No, no
He wears the bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, indeed.
And the coach's plan
But, they played with a 5-5-3-2 formation in the final match.
And as a player, you know that changing the game plan throws off the players, but the Bakers team didn't get thrown off and did a good job.
And the coach's plan
"As the first athlete on the International Bakers' Team, what advice would you give to the players?"
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
"They are welcome, is Hamad Sultan with them?"
Welcome their arrival, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz!
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
"You se
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
Football introduced me to him, I told him that.
I said to him, "O Abu Abdulaziz!"
I've been interested in football all my life.
What's your complaint?
The ball was always close to me, but there were always fifty centimeters between us.
Has Bou Nasser arrived yet?
No, he hasn't arrived yet today.
There is a seminar on football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he must be present.
You see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wants to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
Usually, we tend to meet and talk to a sports figure.
That guy inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What's the news about the International Bakery Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
It's a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
No, man, be generous.
What is my fault, brother Shahin?
Mistake
What's my fault, then?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices in US dollars
That means if a player costs two thousand.
For the fault, it cost three or four million dollars.
What I understand, understand me.
Receive fax here
Read it to me when you have it.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily beat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it says eight hundred thousand on it.
Yes, that's right, God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the Emirates, they sell it for one million and two thousand.
Don't look at me.
Present, can we inspect the goods?
Hani
Calf's leg
Sweet, perfect.
No, no, no, I don't guarantee you.
He is a donkey, God willing, it's good that he is a donkey.
This is slim, suitable for the middle.
The connecting muscle
It is the most important muscle, the player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Let your driver take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did I say! Automatic
Why like this?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yes, we get them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, and then release them into the wild.
"From my eyes, take him. Do you have a place for him or should I put him in my pickup truck?"
When he saw them pressuring us
The offending player was asked to leave.
"In the shade of the acacia tree, no"
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I like his style of managing the game.
This should be on the north road.
In the rules of the game
Even if it's just two days.
What's going on? Why are you shouting?
Your stupid son
I'm not convinced the coach isn't an expert in football.
Listen to her, she talks like Mitsu.
He knows that attacking player Selulu Tekawawa is a good midfielder as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one gives you a headache.
Just leave
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team should consider changing the plan.
As long as the players don't play in their positions.
And player Takulamaka Kola Lalo is lost, he needs to be moved to his usual place.
Ask the coach to change the ...
Dismissal of Hopway Malalo
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what's happening at the stadium?
This is what was supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please defer these topics until after the game is over.
People are noticing this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
His head is hard.
Tell him, Uncle Bu Nasser doesn't want you as a coach for their team anymore.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you stay as a reserve player, do anything I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What's your father doing?
Oh no! Rashid!
What's wrong? You scared me, tell me what's wrong?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
"I divorce you! How?"
I don't know, mother, I just don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without any reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know. He suddenly came to me and said, "Go to your parents' house."
I asked him why. He said, "You're divorced."
I swear to God, I don't know what's happening?
They were only married for a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
All I know is that he divorced her, right now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
My son is crying.
He said that he left Barcelona, a team he loves and respects a lot.
They insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me, "I left Barcelona for you," and I said, "Divorce her and I'll find you another one."
You tell him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
So, that's why he divorced her, right?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
The wife questioned her husband's loyalty.
How true what I hear!
We don't want a daughter who doesn't respect international teams.
This time, she started mocking Messi.
Problems between a couple occur and we have to deal with them.
One bad apple spoils the barrel.
The girls are many and wish to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And don't interfere. He is my son and I know him well.
I told you, it's none of your business.
I'm mad at you.
Don't tire yourself, my son, and don't think about her.
There is one girl in a thousand.
Why are you angry!
But when I remember her words
This Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Present, my love.
What's wrong with her!
Her name is Mona.
She was married for one month?
If I tell you her story and the reason for her divorce, you won't stop laughing.
To involve you with him, we want your attention.
What does he gain from this person? He divorced his wife for a football team.
The barber knows them and told me the whole story. Mother, don't involve me in this, I don't want to get mixed up with those people.
That is, you are hearing the nonsense of barbers.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her piece and say what she wants to say.
Wealth comes to her.
I told her, "My girl! Don't stop your luck."
If it were just her money, I wouldn't care.
But she will stop her luck and ours with her.
Halfway
He won't deny me anything.
God is independent of this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Do not listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand, don't close the door of luck that will open for us.
Yeah, he knows how to convince her.
You must be joking. He actually divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all this nonsense and don't act crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
It could be that she is the reason or there is something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Burjain slip through your fingers.
What's this, O Father of Two Towers?
But when they get closer, they discover it's two towers.
This is why they called his father Shahin Abu Borgin.
Welcome, God.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
God grant you a long life (proverb), They took the money a long time ago, I fell and they spent the money.
Your happiness, you were absent-minded and seemed to be very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, divorced.
He was married and then divorced.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, my brother, hold on to him tightly.
Oh my! This is a difficult generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
A thousand congratulations, a thousand congratulations, my daughter.
Oh my daughter, don't forget the chicken, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you whenever you ride on a plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Oh my son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mama.
Okay, enough.
So you can come with us and drive with us later.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mama.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's the matter?
I had my best day when I ignored her.
It's okay.
In the honeymoon month, it's her duty to pamper you by all means.
Is it logical that she's sitting while you're pouring the water?
The cup is next to you, why don't you pick it up and drink?
She was brought up well.
You should have told her that since the day I was born, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's wrong with her?
You look very sad.
And who is this with her?
Her name is Mashael.
Poor thing, he died during their honeymoon.
Won't you believe me if I tell you her story?
May God protect you, auntie. Thank you.
Your aunt asked, and your uncles too.
Yeah, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Hello, Mom.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or strength except from God.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You tell me, how would I know what happened between them!
By God, it won't happen.
So, where's Manira?
She is in her room talking to that crazy person.
Now she says she's been calling him for two days and his phone has been off.
I just found it.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's angry? The boy just came from outside, tired and wanting to rest.
Mom, every day I tell her to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. Every day she upsets me.
And you know I don't like the apple with its skin.
Don't peel the apple.
Hello, let me tell you.
You are divorced.
And if necessary, one more.
Walk, my darling! My light of eyes.
Walk, my darling! My light of eyes.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still sad!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Be quiet, may God give you health.
I don't know, mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
Right, he has nothing to say.
Dance a few dances.
And let whoever divorces my daughter die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to vent my anger on this shameless man.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the remaining girls are a toy between your hands and your son's.
They don't have families and mothers to taste the bitterness in their throats.
Who are you mocking?
You let them go as you please.
What helped you drink water, insult Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
Those who went to a nightclub
Without shame or embarrassment
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and his son's reputation.
Stop and don't move.
You have a bit of humanity.
It was my father's right.
Who sells land like this?
Abu Sakr took it from his father by force.
Why does he sell it?
God guides you. If Abu Saqr wants something, who can say no to him?
Leave it to God, my dear.
Come inside, come inside.
Come on, come on.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to finish your project, you need to start paying him.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
%pw is what he eats? Isn't there anyone in this world who eats?
This isn't a problem, brother. We'll make him eat and fill his stomach, but the issue is how we'll reach him.
You should know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I met him during Umrah and greeted him more than once.
All you need to know is that as long as you pay him and get your work done, all you need to know is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Ah! Dad, anyone.
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's very fun to spend the night at this farm.
Yes, Your Honor, I am Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency behind the mall.
He wants to get to know you, Your Honor.
I got the license.
"Like my son who got his license."
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, just say OK.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
A gift for him.
By God, you will not say no.
My work is flourishing.
So you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't act like a fool.
Yeah, it's okay, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances served me.
And we were sitting with him.
His son just got his driver's license.
I have a gift for you.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, take me to him.
Yes, it's done.
I just got out of the hospital.
Tonsillectomy
And he will surely do something great.
You deserve the safety of your son, Your Excellency.
We hope it improves, we hope it improves, God willing, he won't see any harm, God willing.
And we met at the flower shop.
I think so.
Oh my! We're starting to forget and we're getting old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the room next to ours and left a long time ago.
I mean, I thought I should visit you.
And I congratulate you on the health of the falcon.
Listen, sir, you shouldn't leave without having dinner with us.
I don't feel like it.
Just say yes first.
Because our dear Waleed Shahin was discharged from the hospital,
In my tower on the corniche.
Just say yes.
Oh my son, don't be stubborn.
Oh, mother, don't even try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
How does one start a project without capital these days?
In the vehicles and bulldozers agency, he said, "Just let him point."
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
The majority of them are in his council every night.
Whatever God wills, your father is loved by all, you just need to point him out.
Wow! Some people take out loans from banks to start a company or a project.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is something new.
This is Saqr, the light of my eyes. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
I only took their agency yesterday.
"You se
He told me later that all the merchants love me, may God make everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to work
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
By God, I like it.
I don't know who its owner is.
A thousand congratulations, congratulations Uncle Saghir, a thousand congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it so easily?
You, you can say no now.
So what's the deal?
What should I say?
Be my partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
Who knows who his father is!
I said I was Qasem Abbas's friend. He asked me, "Do you have experience in trade?"
I said, "I have a bakery, thank God, from which I earn my living."
No, no, I didn't like the name.
I didn't notice it.
No, oh! Brother, the name is not nice.
This is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Understood, big bread.
Qasim, we call it the big bread bakery.
Wait a minute.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you too, and the mercy and blessings of God, O Judge.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
Your Honor, she just sent her car for repairs and came to take mine because she is an advertising agent in a marketing company and she cannot do anything without her car.
You may still need your car.
No, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone needs to have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent! Oh, Dr. Sami!
Yes, Your Honor.
Lesson and class.
You're repeating what's written in the books.
What he studied was neither business nor economics.
He has never read a book in his life, not even a newspaper. I've never seen him hold a piece of paper in his hand.
Do you know who is the hawk today?
I didn't want my father to enter this field of trade and %pw.
Uncle Abu Nasser is here, alive and well before you.
Who likes it.
But some people are born for trade, and by nature, they love trade.
Sincere, doctor, ah!
God willing, Shahin, you will be like your brother.
God is generous (proverb), God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one is like you, Doctor!
Frankly.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily attain this great economic feeling?
If there are a hundred billionaires in the world today, he would be one of them.
Do you know Haiyah Abu Saqr?
Saquar chose a knight to lead the market.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you told me once that you heard Falcon son of Falcon Father wants to take over the car dealership from my father?
You no longer have the agency.
People are never satisfied.
His father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to trade.
Frankly, the doctor said he's in critical condition.
This isn't going to work.
Anything can happen.
Shocked or not, it's none of my business, I'm telling you, you're going to divorce her, you will divorce her.
In the 21st century, there are people like that.
Today, dear viewers, we meet one of the kind and giving men in this country.
A man knows the way to the beggar and the deprived.
I mean, we have a founder and chairman of the Sakar Charity Association.
Of course, if we're talking about this organization, Sir,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to achieve for the world, and of course for everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, we were recently able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
However powerful you may be, O my master, would that God might make many like you.
My wife and I just left the house.
But my wife takes half an hour to open her new project.
And I'll wait for her.
Okay.
I really enjoy their company and love spending time with them. I have so much fun.
And it's my family's livelihood as well.
This is all my life.
I think you're trying to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Regular hot bread, hot bread.
Let's go, people!
In the 21st century, there are people like that.
In the 21st century, there are people like that.
If anyone wants to dive, diving takes effort.
Needs brave men.
Live the Souq Waqif experience.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from goodness.
I want to say something, but tell me if it's okay.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin must go to the exhibition and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
Breezes blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
O breeze, for love's sake, take me back to my home.
Hello, Fadi.
How are you?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days! Ah! Fool.
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes more time.
And if God wills, will you start talking to Alaa and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but my father won't be angry.
What else does Fadi want? They're starting to envy you.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them, not like our people.
Don't let me forget about it.
Is my dress ready?
Here you go, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
Oh brother Fadi, I'll come by next week to get the dress, okay bye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
Whatever God wills, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing amazing work and the girls are coming and going.
Alhamdulillah, we achieved great success in this project.
What's wrong with him?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong with him?
Look at the jealousy!
And we have not heard that he started a project, where does this bankruptcy get money from.
Open their mouths, plunder!
Or he starts his business.
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, what will you do?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
Look, I just want to talk to you about something.
I heard you.
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these matters, may God guide you, brother!
Design, women's fashion design, or something like that?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need advice, you need %pw. I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you! Oh, uncle, thank you!
Excuse me, I have to go.
Come in, buddy!
The first time I tell you if you need a raise.
I mean, oh! Fadi cleaned the shop. I see you're busy.
The shop is no longer enough.
I said the shop next to you is closing, so go ahead and take it.
Inshallah
Did they rent the shop next to us?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your uncle Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a document at my friend's place. His name is Essam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the contract and his name was written on it.
He healed, he healed, he healed.
He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he has a flaw.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw my project succeed,
You told me I had to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a sheep herder? What does he say?
I was testing you; I asked if you were planning to start a project.
I didn't lie to you, men.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your requests.
But that's not what gets you there.
Man, this is a living, and everyone takes their living.
You beat me.
Come on, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh has crossed the line.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer bag.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Madam! This looks wonderful on you, no, no, no, this is it, there's nothing like it in all of Doha.
Oh, how wonderful! This suits you, madam, with your beautiful words, and the piece that's worth a thousand is sold for thirty or forty thousand.
Yeah, do like him.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
My lady! I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented in all of Doha.
Look, if you want to succeed
What's wrong with him exactly?
Why don't you know?
It means he stole the customers.
What do you think about moving to another place, buddy?
Don't mention it, don't mention it! Oh, Fadi.
And now it's playing by itself.
It means we lost, no!
We need to confront them!
And we make our customers come back against their will.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
The clothes you chose are worth sixty thousand riyals.
Certainly without the tie in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
I put a crystal on it, there are only fifty pieces like it in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are globally renowned.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's wrong with you? What happened?
Hurt us, O Sa'd, hurt us.
Is this something they do?
They've slaughtered us; there are no more customers.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We're not stopping to watch!
We need to fight them the way they fight us and respond to them as well.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
And I'll start a war against them and you'll see what I do.
Abu Nasser won't stop her.
Check the ad!
Check the ad you've posted!
We offer a free evening dress with every wedding dress.
Amidst wedding dresses, he designed four evening gowns.
We'll place a quarter-page ad.
Look, he's placed a half-page ad.
How should I know what he intended to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their shop.
No, they didn't open today in the afternoon, they are closed.
And you hear that he put his shop up for sale.
By killing him, I kill him.
Even they can't sit there, so he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
"What tea, may God guide you? I can't drink it, that's a problem."
Does anyone hate you?
In one, God bless you, spray the place with this smell intentionally.
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the shop?
You're cousins, not kids, so don't fight like children.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, that's your scent.
Don't cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I adjusted his hellish plane.
Without anyone catching me red-handed.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear to God, I don't know what's happening. Today is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our shops.
Oh no, this isn't the right shop, we have to go to the other one, I've lost face, God guide you.
What did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and there are no customers entering the store.
I don't know, it's as if they bewitched him.
Women and children shouldn't come near the shop.
She turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
He is charming and evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go and see it, brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will fall.
Lost, oh Sultan, lost!
I don't know, it's a dog!
Leave him alone!
Calm down, brother, don't be angry.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? They say his friends have started collecting money to pay off his debts.
This is designed.
What is Lebanese?
You told him, didn't you?
Do you know where he is?
The stars have them, and we're searching for these extra things with all our might.
Call the men again, maybe they have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed?
Get well soon, Ahmed! Here I am, and the manager is shouting at me! What should I do? Where are those files you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone. I called him and ended up with a headache, even asking Professor Abdullah.
First of all, don't shout. We're actors and we want to rest a bit. We need to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man called more than once in front of me, but calm down.
What do you say, Abu Abdullah, what do you say?
Oh God! Professor Abdullah, what should I do now, the director is finishing the scene and shouting at me.
Present! Oh, boys, present! Oh, boys.
We want to finish, but the extras who are supposed to be in this scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want someone to shout at you, do you?
Work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our state, screaming from morning till night. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about stabbing yourself with a knife until God sends someone to play the role well?
It's true that he only appears in one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Just go and let me go now, please.
But if I'm not ready today, I'll quit the job.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
"I'm saying something, is it okay in Filipino?"
You don't know Abu Walid, he always quits jobs. He wants someone who looks like they're from the elite, they have to be from the elite and Qatari.
Wow! He'll just wear the gutra and agal, and no one will notice.
Do you mean what you say, Alaa? You only want the easy way, this is production, respect people's feelings and minds.
Delegate all responsibilities, distribute tasks, and you'll be at ease.
Calm down so we can think. Think with me, Reem, maybe you remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember someone from the Power neighborhood, named Saud Usher?
Saudi grapes themselves.
Saudi said a treasure!
The manager said he needs a wealthy man of stature, and you say cans!
Dear, by the end of the day he's just a bit player, you'll bring in a rich and distinguished man for a bit part.
Just with light makeup, Reem wore a traditional cloak and a clean robe, and rode in a luxurious car.
Insha'Allah, it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy treasure?
So who is he?
Ah, ah, ah, that's it, that's it.
That's it, thanks a lot.
And now, how will you walk, mother? There's no other option but this dish that my uncle brought from abroad.
Oh my son, you only have what you are wearing.
My son, here it is inside the closet under my clothes.
Oh my god, the people outside are waiting, what's the hurry?
Oh my Lord, may you be happy, my child!
Today I'll see you and people will see you on TV.
Oh, Mom, they told me I'd be appearing on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you wretch!
Come on, guys. What's this? Spitting on you.
Vaporizer, vaporizer.
This is for you, Mom.
Quickly, mama, did you do well?
If God wills, my son!
God forbid, hopefully they just give you money.
May God help you.
Pray for me.
I'll get you a can, Saud a laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
This is Abboud, Fatima's son, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Who's creating the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, he'll do a good job. Calm down and be quiet, so they give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She's not the same person who used to pick berries like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, we rely on your nomination.
The men who brought him to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
He's here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Try as hard as you can, this is our manager, Professor Ghaleb Fadl.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Oh brother, I only fear God.
Don't be afraid, be quiet and listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager says.
Oh brother! Oh brother! Please, you're going to act as one of the elite, one of the rich people, got it?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is very light, the role needs a serious person.
Anything goes for some people.
He asked me why I speak like that.
Brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen, I'll take you to the makeup room now and I'll coach you on the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop! Slow down!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Hey, boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he purifies everything, he does it.
We'll do it again, and the assistant director is there to watch you and assure the director.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You're saying this?
Yes, yes, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush. I didn't expect that from you. Oh! (Abu Abdul Aziz), say you're Abu Abdul Aziz.
For our rights.
Sweet, and you need to know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother!
He will do the cleaning and complete the full name Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Al-Marzook, nice.
Sweet, go ahead, go ahead and think.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't bother thinking about why he divorced her.
"Is she divorced, sweet? Sweet?"
She's beautiful, go introduce yourself, we don't get married.
Why don't I spit on him?
Excellent, you are excellent and he memorized everything, excellent.
Let him clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Wow! Guys, the house owner surprised us and wants the living room, so the director decided to finish the indoor scenes first, and then we'll shoot the outdoor scenes.
How are you? They don't want %PW!
Yeah, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed to the second day. They'll shoot another scene, and we'll be there, God willing.
Should I tell them to get you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you too.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe do you belong to, boy?
My name, sir, is Salem Abu Shwei Shwei.
The Shawys are famous.
You deserve it.
It itches, my nose is big and also the lips can be placed here.
Tell me, my brother! O people of the refined nose now,
I'm holding myself.
If it were someone else, he wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mama.
My mother is very sick, I need to go quickly, brother!
You're wearing this outfit.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she's very tired and he's saying!
Listen, you can do that, but when I call you, you must come right away.
He and I, we can't get out of the place.
Alright, alright, I'll try to find a taxi. Brother!
What is a taxi? If you look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
We're renting the car for the scene.
Take it while it's hot.
Hello! Brother, please give me the key. My mother is tired, give me the key, give it to me.
She's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
One moment, one moment, I'll bring the chair now, right now, sir.
Can I tell you something, can I tell you something?
My mother is very tired in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? In the car?
Oh my! What happened, my son?
Be quiet and don't speak, just watch and stay silent.
Peace be upon you.
There's nothing wrong, but my mother, madam, is having a breathing crisis, quickly.
I'm telling them to make the bed.
Present, present.
And don't bother.
God save you, what have you done?
Cool! Rashid.
Take care of my son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Professor Rashood.
Come with me, Professor Rashood.
And I'll take Mr. Rashood and do what's necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what you want to drink, Your Excellency.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid!
Excuse me.
What should I do with so many people, but wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first one; Nasser, the hospital security guard, married a Filipino woman.
What made you think I refused?
No one gives me any attention.
They analyze and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, what is this, I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Oh brother! There's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
I can't, oh brother! My heart is suspended.
Your brother fell in love, believe it, when I saw her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May he be damned.
My lord judge, our aunt is now in good health.
You're a professional actor, Saud. Next scene, guys!
Bravo, see how they applaud you and praise you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh man, forget about it, come here and give me a hug first.
Yes, from today, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget this and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook, Abu Abdulaziz.
May God help you, dear.
Buffet one!
I evened two.
Even I heard one of the bride's relatives say: "Wow, they are so classy. I don't think anyone can do what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love. Goodbye.
Look at this, Mom.
I want to bring them something to celebrate the signing of my marriage contract.
What's wrong, mother?
Look at your brother who is humiliating us!
Yikes, this is embarrassing, by the way it's cheap.
But this works within our budget.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He's going to tell us a joke.
Nice to see her.
This type is the free category, dedicated to the sophisticated community.
Around above average.
No, we want something unusual, something no one can afford.
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities.
Shut up, just shut up, you don't make sense.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What is this luxury, so advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I'm at your service, I'm at your service.
He's coming to you.
They booked the small hall and unfortunately the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What she said about Saad's wedding.
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
Oh my dear sister,
All he cares about is money.
He doesn't care about what people say.
He's going to tell us a joke.
But we should get something according to our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people borrow money and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and to prevent people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, and the cheap chocolate is enough to insult us with it.
I said the manager liked the Chinese food and took it home with him.
Okay, if the bride's family says that we choose the hall, the theater, and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we choose anything!
No, not really, but the store we just went to has very reasonable prices.
On the way, this store designed Abu Dharr's wedding ceremony.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, just once.
At the wedding of Mukaram's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't want anything used.
I need a platform that we will be the first in the world to use.
This means you want to stand out.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and sophisticated.
What's the price of this theater with other arrangements?
According to you now, but not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Yamma yamma, with this way our money won't be enough, everything is luxurious, better, and more sophisticated, all of this costs money.
Everyone does that.
Be quiet, please.
What's the decision?
I mean, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your family, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, I don't need Noah's Ark.
This is a wedding and its costs. By the way, we are from the middle class.
Do I have to pay 150,000 for the theater hall and 150,000 for the sports hall, the one you reserved as the Royal Sports Hall as you say?
I didn't say box, but why the showing off and everyone trying to look at each other and everyone wanting to do better than the other.
This is a show of pride, and only wedding hall owners benefit from it.
Who knows that they all want to be different, exploit us, and lie to us.
I swear to God, I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding hall.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father says yes.
Alright, do something.
Like other men who get married and manage their affairs.
Hello Sheikh, Happiness.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
This is the reason I called you.
First time in Qatar, designed by the world artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
From our solar system.
By the time of Noah's Ark, it's going to look stunning.
There is no such harmony; you will be the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright then,
It was one and a half million, and now?
Alright then,
May God fill your heart with patience.
As You Like It
Expenses are high, my brother.
In the way that I can bring all eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd!
How can I get things done, Fahd! We're in trouble as long as we're wasting time at weddings.
There's no need to show off.
Certainly, you will receive the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we'll start with the invitations.
Our wedding will be better than theirs.
Oh my god, look at the invitations your son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitation cards.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design the invitation card, print it, and then return. After Manira's family,
They went to France; even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their visas.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
Why, which country do you want to travel to?
We received many nice invitations.
He is dear to me, that's all.
It's just unique and no one has done it before.
Shine, I love it.
Gold was much better, it shined.
Oh brother! If he can't afford the expenses of marriage,
Why did he get involved?
And stop all this show-off and boasting at weddings and this useless waste.
The only beneficiaries of our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he's going, poor thing.
Let me take him, he might not find anyone to take him.
Come on, ride with me.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Brother, the bride's family should support you.
I tried once, just once.
I told them that there was no need for a ballroom in a very well-known hotel.
Why, you found our daughter on the street, and are there people better than her?
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's all about a simple party and some minor expenses.
Come on, man, they're making Facebook passports now.
Cheaper and less costly.
That means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You see.
If I don't get Abdullah Roaished or Nawal for my son's wedding.
Her mother declares, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If your son has Rawaished's number, give it to us so we can call him.
My love, thank you very much, goodbye.
Oh mum, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
And is Umm Nصورr going to be better than me?
Forgot who she is and who we are?
Those who were below us have become better than us.
That's it, Mom. Look at my brother Saleh. He's the one who broke my heart, and we're not putting this much pressure on him.
By God, he broke my heart.
Seriously?
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, it just happened suddenly.
I heard the news and she just fainted.
He's all talk and no one can blame her. After she prepared everything and people found out, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's causing us embarrassment, he wants to cancel the wedding.
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
My son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, rest and relax.
I swear to God, if you say this to Abu Yusuf, his heart will stop.
Do you know why the minister has kept Abu Youssef until now?
On track, he should retire in three or four years.
There's nothing wrong, he's helping me.
I swear to God, you're crazy.
Understood, what do I want from him now?
And you'll keep quiet until he returns the money.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're terrified.
There's nothing to fear, and in the end, I'll return the amount to you.
You know what they call me, you know what they call me?
Disciplined, discipline.
Oh my uncle, oh my uncle, I tried, but there's no other solution.
If I give it to you and then people come to check.
They are relentless in their scrutiny, they are going to take me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the board, the board, the board.
I ate, I ate the pill.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we'll be in the banquet hall to receive guests.
No, we'll definitely be there.
I'll throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Oh my darling Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm afraid they'll envy you, Willie, my son, if you go in to them tomorrow in this shape in your cloak.
Oh mom, is the length of the dress okay?
The police are here!
Inshallah, there's nothing wrong.
"Okay, just stay here and I'll be right back."
May God protect you, Salouh!
Forgot your wedding.
The marriage cage, now we're entering the prison cage.
They discovered the document I was hiding about your loan, and suddenly, they discovered me.
Why are you angry!
You hear worse things than this.
What else can we say!
A respectful and honest employee
The one who loves his job, the ministry contracted a company for maintenance.
The employee, in his eagerness to do his work, went and inquired about the materials.
He knew it cost four hundred thousand.
He saves one million six hundred thousand for the ministry.
The minister punished him! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why don't you believe!
This is Saad.
Certainly, he has all the news.
He's fed up with work.
What's happening to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him, "Let her work instead of Osman."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
What did you find, Osman?
No, no, no, no, this isn't true.
Oh, Saleh! You're always so surprised! Oh!
Whose company is this?
For whom?
That's how it is!
What do you want to say!
That doesn't concern my speech, what about this poor employee Uthman, what's his fault!
His mistake is that he is honest and trustworthy!
Do you think the president is in his office?
Yes, he left a moment ago.
What's going on in this world!
We saw some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but we can't do anything (like that).
What is justice, Your Honor? He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
His living depends on this job! What's he going to do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister.
She entered Uthman's office and started working. Alas for Uthman, when he came to take his belongings, she prevented him and said to him: "Go, and I will send your belongings with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have changed, Uthman!
This is the reward!
This is God's will and destiny.
Praise be to Allah, the Most High, the Most Powerful.
Oh, generous Lord of all creatures, O Uthman, may God not separate beloved ones. Farewell.
What's wrong? You don't look well!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Hard work! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
And you can stop by my mom's place and pick up the stuff.
I don't want you to stay sad like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How can you go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
A changed world, where are you living?
I don't know, mother!
You're crazy.
People have been liberated, the world has become a small village, where are you living!
Oh, how wonderful!
Be modern, live in this time, and don't lag behind.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Move, don't look at me and lock it.
Something's wrong, Saleh. What's the matter?
No, you're not feeling well today.
I shouted at the poor maid, she was innocent.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
So I can forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The manager is a bit angry.
It is our pleasure, Your Honor.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Fatigue, effort, and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this office.
That's true, Your Honor!
Tell me, what's the use of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
He doesn't deserve it.
This is the reason why I want each one of you.
There's no place for honest people and those with outdated principles and values.
If one day I discover
He only blames himself.
Justice is a principle, whether the reaction is positive or negative!
That's why I'm asking you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just say yes.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nour ever takes a bribe, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't just want her to be like this, I want everyone to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I'm asking you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Sadiq, you know how to choose, you've picked the right thief for the right place.
Enough oh! Mother of Saud enough, don't torture me more.
I don't want to live in prison.
But Allah sufficed me against Satan, he tempted me and made the truth seem beautiful to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why torment yourself with honesty and integrity?
You've always been a thief and comfortable.
Praise be to God, I'm feeling better.
Let me talk to your father.
Don't do it again.
One should be on the straight path, bribe, steal, and be hypocritical to live comfortably.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Stop, stop.
This is something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it discovered?
You're shameless, you have no shame.
I'm shy, I wear my brother's clothes.
Are there shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Are there respectable women who wear this?
As you walk in the street, is nothing visible of you?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to me.
I've never withheld my support here.
I bought her see-through clothes she doesn't need.
I'm warning you, if I ever see you wearing anything above the knee.
As long as you know the situation, don't blame me for the results.
We're here, God bless you.
God willing, he plays with girls and is evil.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't be afraid, Uncle, I'm ugly.
What a kind man. Honestly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
We haven't heard from her since.
Alhamdulillah, her reputation is very bad.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Stop her, dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I still love you, I've been hiding, hiding, hiding.
In brief, Dad, Dad, is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Majid.
No, Papa, Abdelaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
Welcome, please come in, here's some weed.
Arabic, Israeli, and artificial satellites
It was discovered that many Palestinians do not cut their nails.
As committed by the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingers.
Let's see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should cut, pierce, or draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
It is made of cork.
And olives, oh man!
We press the olives like this, like this we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community.
Forming inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, you don't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih, Salih, what's wrong with you?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh no! Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now oh! Brother, what's the number of the school where you'll work tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What's your personality, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
On the contrary, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
That's enough, brother.
That's why you see him silent.
Then, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh brother, we're not talking to you to make you upset!
We're telling you this because it's your last chance.
He told me Rashid accepted, even though he has a weak personality.
Hesitant, and that's in addition to being kind.
Whatever he is, he's a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is right.
Everything you say is right.
I will tomorrow.
The new Sheikh Rashid.
Hello, Professor Rashid,
You're 100% right.
Alright, don't worry.
And tomorrow,
Yes, this is good and what else?
Here I tell you
I am a teacher, I don't like mistakes.
Let's say a boy jumped up and told you what the other boy said at your previous school, with the principal present.
Take your bag!
Gradually, gradually, break the door.
Okay, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I tell you
I'm nervous.
This is on me!
Just shut up!
He seems to have said, "Just shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him Professor Rashid expelled me.
It seems he said what concerns me, but he'll see, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Whose boy is he?
This is Mr. Rashid J.
Did you see him?
Professor, the problem is if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him? = "Sitting, sitting during break time?"
You might find him sitting in the chair area.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, man.
But you shouted at me!
Friends joking around, you're joking with me.
My father is out of town and he'll be back next week. I'll tell him when he returns.
No, no, no, no, Abdul Rahman, may God protect you.
We are friends. By the way, strawberry ice cream is really good, you should try it. It has a bit of acidity, but it's amazing.
Okay, go do your homework quickly.
What I fear is that he'll tell his father.
I said his father is traveling by land.
Yeah, he's out. Doesn't his father come back? That means they took his father's things and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
I carried his bag and brought it to him, I gave him your number, and I told him that if he needs anything, he should call me, I am your friend.
Yeah, just.
Yes, but what?
You're the ones who told me.
Screaming and claiming you're strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh no! Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't tire yourself out, sleep.
Oh, Father Nasser, Professor Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's the reason I gathered you here, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can anyone guarantee a child?
This is going to get us into trouble, that is, he's calling.
At three o'clock.
Hello. He's just joking, God willing.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Teacher! Come, come here, teacher!
Are you done crying?
I'm not mocking, I swear! Man, I'm just asking, are you done?
Whether you finish or not, where is the teacher's authority? In this way, you are disrespecting yourself and the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, enough, enough.
Do you also raise your voice?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first thing you need to know about this boy?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Make room, make room, we have plenty of space. Come on, come on, come on.
He thinks he's the boss of the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
God helps him.
I am the school principal here.
Ma'ruf Abu Nasser
It's used to give all the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who's the manager here?
You are the school principal, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
What you've put on your head, it's on the chair, brother!
What do you mean?
No need, I swear my father is honest, I just want to rest from you.
What do they call it?
What should we do with you now?
Calm yourself, it's better for your health, and don't take more than you need or want.
Get out, go, go, go, get out of here!
Present, I'm leaving.
As you wish, we've told you, man!
We must put him in his place.
Wait, people, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Salman!
Oh, Abu Naif! You're the big boss of the neighborhood, and you need to stop him from crossing the line.
I am my father's son.
I'll see what I can do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Honor.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
You wouldn't believe it, but I knew it was him as soon as he spoke.
Did you know he got promoted last week?
This means that he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magic? Ask him, he'll tell you, what's the secret that made him rise from below!
I've been telling you since day one,
I don't want to hear any noise while I'm explaining.
And we are content.
Follow your path.
And you still reply to me, and you still argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, out, out.
If you are appointed a minister, look for a good job along with you.
Don't tell me to come and take this job.
Unless the second job, no, my brother, give me options, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable one.
My brother is a minister!
I swear to God, I'm not comfortable with the call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What do they say about you, O mother, may God guide you.
This is very normal. Every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, it was a pleasure to meet you.
They know I'll become a minister.
I mean, they're bribing me, it's a smokescreen.
Good luck to us, a treasure, a treasure that will open for us.
The big earth.
Come on, everyone go congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Your Excellency.
By the blessing, O happiness, our congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Excellency the Ambassador, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister!
Oh brothers, the responsibility is great, may God help us bear it.
As they say, you are very qualified for this job.
I left, then Abu Saleh's mobile rang.
It was far from him.
Forget him.
I wonder how she can love him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Machine Allah, you've done a lot!
We're waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
Kafiya says, "Stories, stories."
After her husband died, she said she had envied him.
God forbid, God forbid.
Ah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Oh mum, let's go, I'm bored.
How does that not concern you?
Just stay chill.
I interrupted them because they were making me anxious.
Yeah, they're right.
But I didn't want to say this in front of my mother, you know she tells everyone.
You blab everything you hear; they call you a sieve. We don't want any scandals.
What guarantees that they will put you in his place if he loses power?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees that they will hit it?
No, I'm sure about this.
Needless to say, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You're going to bewitch him.
But the plan in my head is guaranteed and effective.
It's the burn and kick strategy.
I'll make him attend every event in the village.
At this time, a flame will reach him, and when the flame reaches him, he will step down from his position. And when he steps down from his position, he will resign.
I swear to God, brother, I don't know how and I don't know what to tell you!
Your visit is called, it is called participation that reflects the extent of your love for your country.
Do you believe that?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Come on, Your Honor, this is just a sheep, it doesn't deserve this from you. What do you think, Your Honor? Will you come with me today?
The driver is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I'm sick, tired of the respect, tired of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are from the upper class, elevate your status!
God sends you this good man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
Today I'm taking him to a poetry night and a wedding reception, and they've taken at least a hundred pictures of him.
"He says stay away from something very nice that leads to it."
Listen, I've also arranged a really nice educational activity for you.
That's it. Let it shine, I want it to shine, let it shine, let it shine until it sparkles. I'm looking for that shine.
The delegate, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, a picture of Your Highness. Photos, photos. Don't take my picture, far away, photos.
This is the bicycle.
Congratulations on your new beginning, and best wishes for your happiness.
Picture, picture like this. You are fat, fat sir.
"Nothing, God bless you."
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
This is a national contribution.
Say what God wants.
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurt me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
A party for the kids' swimming victory.
There was a man talking to his friend,
They thought I couldn't hear them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my brother's son.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, every day in the newspaper.
Correct, correct,
Your presence in this majlis is a light, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's fine.
That means you're not going to go out, take a walk, and sit with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Until Abu Sultan is ready to go, I'll wait.
He sat me in the front row and then went to the car to rest.
We don't want anything from him, may God guide you.
Oh my! Oh Mary, may God keep your family safe, ask them. I want to call you later to make sure.
And you call your soul.
People offer us discounts.
I told you.
Very nice Halloween.
Just let this guy take me!
The minister's happiness annoyed me, God make him suffer.
Hello, hello Your Excellency the Minister.
No, but I'm a bit tired today and
If you're that excited, we're at your service.
We're at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and show you around, and I hope he can find a party or something for you.
Then, a party?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Okay, where can we find it?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone I can ask?
Go, God bless you.
Sleep and rest.
Just a moment, Saad.
Is there anything, even for a henna night?
Yeah, this is fine.
And there might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and find a photographer to take his picture.
Okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a reserve league match. Let him sit alone in the stadium!
What is this! This official has become a disaster for us!
Sweet, that means he reached the top.
When he became the talk of the town, his end was near.
Oh, my lord judge, he has become much more popular than you.
Oh, my lord judge, if I went to a place and took Abu Saleh with me,
Oh, Judge!
Her star shines.
We'll turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break you. I'm not coming out.
Brock breaks their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
They say I missed the train.
This is Khalid, my brother.
There is no power or strength except from God.
Why like this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see him!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this Khalid?
I haven't seen him in ages, come to me, my love.
What's he doing? He's very attached to her.
There is no power or strength except from Allah; you keep coming back to the same topic.
Get out, get out and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and don't make a big deal out of this.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear to God I'll tell my dad, look at your face, you look like a girl.
It means he was playing, playing.
Yeah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud. I know what to do with him.
Poor Khalid, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he's doing about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and greet.
How are you, my love?
No, my love, we're not going to travel to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to my words.
There is no power or strength except from God.
I'll let the dear Amal choose at her leisure.
But seriously, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
Even in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can go directly from home to the sea.
We and our children.
Please, you need to set a wedding date.
No problem, just a year or so.
Your brother is overdoing it with the perfume.
Frankly, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to do as they please.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know there are unisex perfumes.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
I don't care.
How true, Khalid!
What is your cologne like women's perfumes?
They even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
By God, you have nothing to say.
Oh mother, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Currently, perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends at the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You need to see it, then I'll tell you.
Look how the girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid Muhammad's cousin.
Belongs to my cousin Khalid.
Present, you'll see what I do with it.
His brother Saad is waiting now.
Why? Let him come and see. Come on, Saad, come here! I'll send him the Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you were defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Is your Bluetooth on?
No, I'll just send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
I'm traveling tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself?
What do people say?
They say their son left them and traveled, you don't want to cause us a scandal!
Seriously?
What your son Khalid did is a source of honor and pride!
A man turning into a woman, is that what you call a scandal?
I can't face people when they say he's gay.
Tell him he travels for treatment, study, work, or even to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
Okay, where are we going?
What matters to me is where I go.
This is the end.
We don't know where the other one is, and this one is packing his bags to travel.
Even we don't know where we're going.
What did you expect from him?
What's wrong with you? I come to you to make you feel better, and you respond with harsh words that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you're busy.
Your father is busy with his work and he's putting the responsibility on you.
You're right, Mama.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are correct.
What Khadija did reflected badly on us in the eyes of others.
I can't see anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
This is my father's biggest flaw.
We're in Khalid's strange, bad situation.
I didn't tell him.
Burn it on a CD and give it to him.
Except for when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to be like this! - Amal.
Do not be surprised.
Khaled and his friends don't care about their family's reputation.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values have named them
They go dancing and having fun.
In the evil swamp.
By God, my son, I am perplexed!
Goodbye, Daddy.
Take care, my son!
Hey dad, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what's going to happen, come with me!
Present, Mother.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
It's possible he'll leave.
Where are you going? There's not enough time to go anywhere.
Reply to me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Oh, Daddy!
Okay, oh! Hope,
And if I turn, I fail.
To find someone with your principles,
Just forgive me.
May God help you.
I see you're going up on the roof!
Yes, my love.
We are living in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has one riyal, they can take a thousand, my dear.
Of course I can handle him. God bless America, my love.
Is the salary high these days?
This is one thousand two hundred.
God help you, every time I talk to a driver, I ask him, "What's your salary?"
My salary is very low.
If he sees me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and there are no benefits. We agreed with him on a salary of seven hundred, and you increased it by a hundred when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, "When your year of work is up, I'll increase your salary."
He seems greedy and you'll have tough times with him.
Stop, stop, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, send him back and get rid of him.
This word is easy for you, easy.
You make him complain, I don't like going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
I told you the story now, I'm the master of the house. Shut up, okay? You too, shut up. I'll handle this.
Your father's people are outside, come!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Oh, no, he's not my friend, he's my uncle.
He'll be here in five minutes, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep it in mind!
Don't tell the madam I want a raise, I want a raise in my salary!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Oh boy, I have a lot of problems at home.
Drivers in Doha charge 1100, 1200 riyals.
And it could be a thousand and three hundred.
Wait, I'll think about it.
Listen, if you raise your voice by 100% and more, I'll shut up, I won't raise mine.
What do you say I added you a hundred, go work!
What did he say?
I'm telling you.
There's no use in a hundred.
There's no use in two hundred.
I'm scared, Shashi.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers are escaping.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you make more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at these, they're all drivers.
How much?
2000 and 500
But I'm afraid of the police who will come and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and getting ready to go out.
I was calling, but no one was answering.
He opened his room and the closets were empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I won't say anything except "God is sufficient for him."
Present, Baji is with you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you have no responsibility.
We'll do everything we can.
And you too, keep an eye out in the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yeah, he makes money and when he's full, he turns himself in.
We bring them, spend on them, give them clothes, food, and driving lessons.
It's none of his business.
The match is starting now, go in, you'd better go in.
Yes, we were afraid.
These foxes and jackals aren't easily caught.
Do you know that if we get more than three, it means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear, this is clear sarcasm.
This is his level. If he's not going to score more than three, this isn't the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In us, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank their lucky stars if they score less than three, they should thank their lucky stars.
What's the goal? This is an opportunity for beginners. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, brother.
I scored a goal now, I'm relaxed and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals, or does it end here?
The wolf is very good, he is very smart. He goes here and there and they can't catch him, you'll see how. This wolf eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said that Halfox is a big problem.
You can't catch up with him.
Yes, ah! Sir.
Do you know or not?
He is a Foxes fan.
He sometimes appears on the "Refresh Yourself" show.
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I'll hit you. The Foxes never lose, they always win.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, the seasons are the winners.
The birds came to take their livelihood and flew away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These are foxes, my friend.
The wolf takes the chicken and eats it.
I didn't see what your honor did on the field.
They can't stop laughing at him.
Clear in the stadium and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with the elite Qataris who go to malls and such places.
He invited me for a cappuccino.
What a strange world, man!
The boy gave me five hundred riyals in front of me and settled the bill.
Tell us about your poetry about our match against the frogs.
Thank you all, listeners.
You are a frog.
Aren't you ashamed that my team beat yours 4-0?
Speak rudely, speak rudely about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was driven out
The reason behind this is a ruling.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahbal.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fan.
Excellent, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board members of the club will decide.
They are not all small, each of you is as big as a camel.
From the management of this big club. Fox.
Come, come see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One of them speaks well, and the other is mute.
What do you think, a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The crowd left.
I'm following him.
Look here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Sweet!
Shut up, you're indecisive. I'm the man of the house and I make the decisions.
We need to make sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie.
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subug tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I help you, people? What do you want?
* * May God bless you
Come in, folks. Would you like some coffee?
You don't have anything to say, God bless you. You don't need anything, God honor you.
You say I'm sure, is that right? We're about to embarrass ourselves in front of the elite!
I'm very scared.
Mom, mom, I'm mom.
Now, I don't know what your father is going to do to us.
I didn't mean it like that, Mom.
Oh mom, please don't tell dad.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
He'll definitely kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Oh mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick things together?
What shall we glue, my son?
How can we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm afraid of him for you.
Oh, mother, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
What, what, what! Are you my uncle?
Are you the blind one breaking the jar, or are you blind?
Oh my god, hasn't Waleed come to you yet?
No, oh! My daughter didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This is not right. Have some mercy on the boy!
This is not proper behavior, may God guide you, my daughter!
What should I do now, mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I scared him from the cars in the street.
God willing, He protects him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to our neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he's nice, kind, and friendly, my daughter.
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from Shaytan and don't worry, God willing, everything will be fine.
Present, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Walid?
My father married me off.
Oh, mother, my father is killing me with his beating.
Don't be afraid, my dear.
Don't be afraid, my love.
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come on, son. Come drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
God guides him, God guides him. Come with me, my son, a little bit.
O Allah, the Generous.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come on, my son, don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the poor man feels anxious, trembles, and is alarmed by something he did not intend to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
It makes him see!
The jar broke from the impact of the bag, believe me, it wasn't intentional.
You! You have to support him!
Please don't say anything to me about him. Forgive him this time, his situation is scary and breaks my heart.
But where is he? Where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
What is present here.
He's here! Where?
Go inside, come on!
No, no, I'm taking it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than the old one!
Come on, Nassir! My brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying!
My parents only want me to play this game and study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Dad.
Come on, dad, go and don't ruin the game.
Come on, dad, don't take it seriously. Come on, come on, dad, we're studying.
What are you saying! Listen to me.
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't care.
I'm telling him that you don't obey me.
Go. Everyone take their book and start studying.
Okay, dad, put your phone in your pocket, we're studying, dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Oh God, I'm so confused. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he knows, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course he asks me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
What's the problem if I tell him?
If he knew that Waleed was peeing in his bed, he would kill him.
Oh! Mother, he is to blame. It's all his fault.
Oh, my daughter! It has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child anymore, he is twelve years old now.
Okay, my daughter.
"Will you come and eat with us tomorrow and we'll give you some hints."
And I see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
It's just an expression, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he wets the bed every night.
My son pees in his bed every night, don't tell me the story.
He told me I had to take you to the hospital so they could treat you.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
Yes, indeed.
They need to take him to the hospital, son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
It spins, spins, spins, spins, spins, spins, spins.
He hit him until his screams could be heard by the last person in the neighborhood.
Sit down!
Eat, my child, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly, go swimming, I'll bring you clothes. Go!
Please, if you please.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
You call this a pass?
And Khalid got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass?
But their grades are excellent.
He told them, "You will be punished if you don't get fifty out of fifty."
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They need to be punished.
These are my children.
Present, by God, uncle. Uncle, this is the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him one more.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. It's prohibited.
You are not like us, don't go with us.
Be quiet! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop it, Uncle, I'm dying, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it. I'm dying, stop it, Uncle.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, what you'll see at the end of the year if none of you get a fifty.
I'll drain the pool.
Filled with oil
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
So cool! Excellent, Khaled.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent! Oh! Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
Teacher, he's afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
Oh, my son! I am talking to you!
Call, call your classmate.
He said: "I saw him next to the school gate."
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandmother's house.
No, he didn't go there.
"Where is he? Where is he?"
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
What's wrong with this guy?
Hahaha, he definitely failed and is afraid of his family.
What failed, he was an outstanding student and was second in his class.
But he was afraid to go home.
Because he lost only two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh no! Come here, Waleed.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, lost a mark or two, never mind. I won't say anything, won't scold or beat you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
Which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
Saudi Arabia tops the list with twenty-four percent of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States and Nigeria.
3% for each of them and the rest of the world combined with 15%
And thus
Except production.
Perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons that drive the major industrial nations to scramble for the occupation of this region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, the largest consumer of oil in the world.
But, oil prices are rising continuously.
Concurrent with the decline of the US dollar
Barrel
Where yesterday, the price of a barrel reached
This increased revenue in producing countries, and at the same time
To increase its inflation
Where inflation in some of these countries has reached fifty percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
Prices of goods and living costs
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's communication numbers.
Honorable Deputy, welcome.
I would like to start with you at the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where might prices go?
Of course, where might the prices go? A puzzling question.
Or what we call market forces.
What is OPEC?
What's stopping them from becoming producing countries?
No producing countries, and Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with raising oil prices.
Is this the only relationship between price, supply, and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with the subject.
What are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodities marketing."
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold too.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in past years to $970 now.
And to this day, as I mentioned before, one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, the decline will be slight.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is expected to see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strange state of change.
In the second quarter and the beginning of spring, it exceeds one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
And at the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
In Iran. Do you think that Faloun's resignation in light of the political complexities...
What was accompanying and today leads most American newspapers and global journalism activities. It could affect oil prices.
Yes, 100% and today, yes.
Today, we are in the era of globalization and influence comes quickly.
Non-real factors can influence.
Caused some disturbances in the market.
Also the spread of some kind of political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but did not deny the existence of second options that could be applied to Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Certainly now there's nothing certain that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And maybe there's what we saw happening in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
Let's see if these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
And vice versa in very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil going into storage.
And there is never a shortage in the supply of oil.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
Under this insurance coverage you are referring to for shipping, there are no obstacles to shipping.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
That's another story.
Prices are rising and reaching record levels.
Oil prices might rise.
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, that is certain.
You today
If a very minor accident happens.
Therefore, it indicates
This means that in the event of any war with Iran, there is no guarantee how high oil prices might go.
God knows the day may come, we arrived without reaching.
The Hundred Years' War, the Seven Years' War, a hundred and ten dollars, and it could go up to a hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil is living under political and psychological tensions, as I told you.
And speculators took advantage of these tensions.
Investor in oil only.
Or what is called a non-investor in real investment, of course, neither future buying nor future marketing.
And it is called olive paper.
And it's all guesswork in the oil paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
It could make these people buy more, and then upgrade their devices more.
I wish April was April Fools' Day.
I hope it doesn't happen.
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region, and this is at the top of his agenda.
Cheney is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese bag.
And I can't predict what might be in it, you know.
Is he going to start a war?
America is in transition.
Why doesn't the boy do something else?
Let's see what happens. If we're talking about April, April is almost here, just a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world can pay the price.
And America is a big consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Their production cost is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can.
We've heard this talk from the West and America for years.
Use
"Lina, do you remember the story of the War of the Qazwini?"
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a small circle
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said: "It's strange that you talk among yourselves in closed doors."
In the same way you talk in front.
In the media he said: It's for political reasons.
And of course, there's what is called double standards or double speak.
The language you know is that of the Gulf countries.
It has significance today like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And entering into it.
Despite all this
Leader of the Central Region
Launched a war against Iran.
Even if it's an air war or an airstrike, as they say.
Provisions
You're not late, on the contrary, you're very generous.
I don't agree with you.
We don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Non-renewable energy
For the sake of (between parentheses) generosity
Arab generosity
Give me the spirit.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and the nations.
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on keeping their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the true price, adjusted for the falling U.S. dollar, is sixty to seventy.
Okay, the price now is one hundred.
"Why did the dollar drop by thirty percent?"
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
The comparison
Oil prices
Because of the United States of America.
Certainly, it is currently in our interest for the dollar to decline.
A weak or stagnant U.S. economy, the U.S. can't "do anything"
Why did this economic weakness and recession happen?
You too
The United States cuts interest rates on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is tied to the dollar.
The first, over 100 years old.
The first barrel of oil was produced in the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century to this day.
Oil valuation in dollars
Historically, it happened.
And for a hundred years, the world has been responding and getting angry.
And today, Norway is the third-largest oil producer.
And oil exporters
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Price in dollars, not in riyals.
Everything is changing in the world; other sources and information indicate something different.
You, Gulf countries
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and there isn't
And these are the agreements.
The dollar continues to cover up these regimes as long as oil continues to cover up the dollar.
This is not correct, and there are no secret agreements.
Today we're taking OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent, Your Excellency.
Outside 13 countries
Forty percent of the eighty-eight barrels are for OPEC.
There are many countries that are large producers of oil.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing in a second currency?
Look up the prices in another currency.
It's just until the adults decide.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are good at it.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone.
In sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
In an agreement among all oil-producing countries
In the direction and intention of change
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me speak now why I am European.
Their country does not export oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it's in their interest, their currency is strong and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here's where they lost.
With one euro, they export one and a half barrels.
No, you're the one losing because your currency has decreased in value due to its tie to the dollar.
It is after a great loss, a devastating loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical connection.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
I'm attached now, when you talk about separation.
Easy as marriage when we get married.
And you want to get divorced, it's not easy.
No, here.
Or married a dollar Catholic-wise.
Costs must be examined in a certain way.
Professional inspection and examination
Subsequently, Kuwait dismantled twenty-five percent of its dollar reserves.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar
Can you adjust your currency rate?
Today is about the topic, but this means you have no intention of studying or thinking about it.
"The exam, of course, varies, the Prime Minister said."
It was mentioned that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be in this study.
There's a direction you're going in with this topic on your own.
Kuwait also remained as it was, why didn't it follow its steps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
This poet announces the Gulf countries.
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support it personally.
He supports it.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What did you make from one country or two?
Until we had our own currency.
You're not going to save the situation now.
Certainly, there are experts who conduct this study.
They're the ones who are.
We are experts, this requires a political decision.
We wait and don't hurry. Now let's see what's happening today.
People began, I mean...
Certainly in a position of complicity
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar reached fourteen percent in 2007 and will reach fifteen percent next year.
He ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Salaries of Qatar's residents decreased by thirty to forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to discuss the extent of salary increases.
Employees in Qatar for at least the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah and the industry around the massive rise in prices
with oil that brought back hundreds of millions of dollars to the Gulf and oil-producing countries
About the oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase I would like to give you some important information.
97 and 8 out of 10 billion reserves and produce 2 and 6 out of 10.
Just tone down the report in the Kuwait Times about the economy; Gulf revenues are among the highest revenues.
The expected revenues for Saudi Arabia in 2008 are one hundred and nine billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy years ago, the United Arab Emirates was six years old this year, and it was expected to reach fifty-seven.
Kuwait was fifty-five in sixty-six.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
He is a gas, as reported, and God knows, I mean, we don't envy the honorable deputy.
Iraq forty-four billion.
1.5 trillion
For spending, the amount was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported for a total of one thousand billion, or one trillion.
Dollar was a type of import.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, the ratio was three percent.
In 2007 in Oman, it was six and a half but will increase to seven, in Qatar, it was thirteen point seventy-five but will increase to fifteen percent in Qatar.
This means that residents in Qatar can expect high living costs and inflated prices for goods and services.
Life is getting harder, prices are rising, and they are reaching high and higher rates in Qatar.
We are with everyone in spirit.
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
It means you're increasing their salaries by 50%.
No, they say you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct.
And in the cabinet, against raising salaries.
There's a problem and the solution has to be the ideal one.
And what are patchwork solutions?
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And that's it.
The important thing is to solve inflation.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness issued a decision to form
And it is placed.
A strong foundation is laid.
Solve the problem and control inflation.
What matters now is controlling inflation.
Inflation
If you control it.
Enough, Your Excellency, now.
The one who specializes in market research and published last February, a few days ago.
Among them because of salaries.
Now you will eliminate inflation and let inflation eat away at people's income.
Many of them are here now.
He travels to other countries.
Increase our salaries first, then solve the inflation problem, and then reduce them again.
Repeat what they say is to balance the subject.
Just now
And the solution becomes temporary.
Add more to it.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation
Boredom will always remain.
Because the increase was enormous last year, correct.
The second point is
Private sector employees are not the same as public sector employees.
The private sector is very neglected.
This issue needs to be seen more justly.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellency, not in Germany.
On the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
That's more.
Qatari employees working in government offices have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
You're facing a problem.
Moving to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
It provides good salaries.
Clinging to what they call market forces
Strong market
They come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because its salaries are low or its expenses are low.
Or with expenses they come.
"Tamam, with our clear understanding."
I'm not predicting events, and I'm not saying there's a raise in salaries.
There's no hope left.
Controlling inflation
Let's give her time.
Combating inflation
And, God willing, this is what the report said, that Qatar in 2008
God willing, we say so.
Let's see if these numbers change.
Sprinkle some of it on the people.
This is a professional operation.
Certainly with professionalism and everything.
Price inflation
Because spending
Wide on various projects
Excuse me, I have some questions from the audience, and I hope everyone asks a direct question. Brother Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Based on the ruling families in the Gulf.
So I don't think the justification for this is a difference of opinion within OPEC.
Second, the total oil revenue goes directly to the governorates.
Then to the royal family and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the status quo will persist.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God.
Hello, my brother Ahmed.
I won't prolong the discussion, the brother touched on the topic of governance systems, state systems, and the issue of the Qatari riyal and its peg to the dollar or other Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world and make it submit to its rule.
American deficit reached $83.8 billion as trade between China and the U.S. hit that mark.
The treaty with the European Union is worth sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we, as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf states, are paying the price of its consequences now.
Leads to a confrontation with America.
And among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the issue may become
Purely military
For the explosion, Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and American bombs too.
Thank you very much for this explanation and information.
Your question is to Mohammed.
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I've seen, His Excellency Egypt doesn't respond.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And with God's permission, he will reach the bottom.
He is a kind man.
What should the Arab brothers' style be imitated?
Thank you, Brother Mohamed, thank you. Now we request the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed?
Good evening.
Thank you, and thank you for the great interview.
What's required is a salary increase, God willing, things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, but not in our salaries.
Salaries, by God's leave, are certain.
Alright, tell me your question quickly.
Your handwriting is messy, do you have a question?
Everything is because of the high prices, the increase has affected all goods, they are all exported.
I am from Europe.
In the Arab world, we have factories and laboratories.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you very much, you took your time.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
In support of the poor, the man said to you, Madam Minister: "Hold on to the poor."
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
They are the right of some of our brothers.
Who knows Qatar?
For the state of Qatar, this statement is untrue.
Today, anyone who comes to Qatar will see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and what are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
What's within the scope of the response?
When the Moroccan spoke, he spoke in a way that was neither genuine nor realistic.
"What the eye doesn't see"
If he comes and sees Qatar and how much it has developed.
You're right, growing rapidly, asking questions.
Everyone has a right.
And since your population is small, where do you get people from?
Does this mean you'll bring the surplus from China, for example?
We won't export, God willing.
The city is based on a plan and ...
Complete independence from oil and gas revenues, as we all know that oil and gas will run out one day.
The State of Qatar will transform.
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today after
Focus on
And what will have a great impact.
In the post-oil and gas era
What are you trying to imitate Dubai?
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where people come for treatment.
There will be a media city that adapts.
Certainly the world today, today we must build.
Built a vision
About the post-oil and gas era
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we didn't welcome this change because we were surprised by it.
And we weren't ready, neither humanly, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it changes after thirty years.
And better than that.
Today there is a vision.
"And vision"
And vision
Thank you, Your Excellency the Agent, and I also thank our dear audience.
For following us, we hope we have provided you with what you want.
Qatar's foreign policy appears murky to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
And at the same time, Qatar had relations with Israel and still does.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar presented.
It seemed
The largest Arab country by area
What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Similarly, Qatar was not far from important files.
The example of Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli prisoner.
Gilad Shalit, Qatar's foreign policy reached out to him in a way that angered the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power are you exerting in this position?
Achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Write to us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Hello, Your Excellency
In September 1937, 1337 AH for Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was in stock.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine "Hijaz"
The agreement that was concluded with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which restored relations and the return of the Saudi ambassador.
To Doha
The first time your introduction was too long and needed a lot of answers without your last question.
What I believe you gave him
Specifically in the Saudi context
What's correct?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's mission to Qatar is very important.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the explanation.
# Constitution of the State of Qatar We, the people
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
Point of view
Praise be to God, this was thanks to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf largely
Over a hundred years ago.
They were bright, honest, and their relationships were built on trust.
I want to narrow the gap of misunderstanding between the two parties.
This issue has been dealt with and there are no conditions.
In resolving any issue.
But there was understanding and there was pure intention between the two parties.
Resolve this pending issue.
And its relationship is not seasonal but strategic.
We hope it doesn't stop, we hope it evolves.
Sweet diplomatic talk
Saudi Arabia intends to withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia, this is not diplomacy, but faith.
The topic of "Al Jazeera" falls under media.
Between the parties and many countries got involved in the middle.
She might gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
Reconciling the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries
I mean the exact opposite of the previous statement.
This is part of a political agreement.
No, no, there's no agreement, only an agreement of love and interest.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent a recurrence of what happened previously?
He originally relied on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, and four.
And there needs to be unity.
Some disputes were settled accordingly.
Between some Arab countries and tried to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we look at the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences from different perspectives.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain matter, and another state has a different opinion.
"It is considered my point of vie
Some observers note that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Let's criticize him.
Were you tired and decided to head in a different direction, and from there moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
This is the same idea.
No, no, we don't enjoy either of them, we have nothing to do.
Dealing with any party in this manner
I mean, the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
There's a lot of understanding between them, and I know it.
And you know that we have founded
And there will be a type of form.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
You began with skirmishes with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, issue eighteen, last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a careful investigation, they said that extended investigations
In the Hezbollah network, a sabotage plot was uncovered.
Egypt targets three involved countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
The Medes are known for their conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Head for Egypt.
We respect.
And her struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
President of the Republic of Egypt
And who is the eager one?
On Arab Relations
The first point
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we admit.
Qatar is
Smaller country
It might be part of these things.
Because we suffered from the interventions of other countries at one point, and my father doesn't want to go back to those days.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy
I'm trying to say that a house is protected by its owner. Syria and Iran are capable of defending themselves; I won't defend them.
If the situation stabilizes in Egypt.
Why does Qatar want to change or interfere in this matter?
A pyramid doesn't rise from nothing.
It was said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And aimed to organize a conference parallel to the Arab summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
What spirit?
With the Party of God
And we're not comfortable with this.
But I can say that I'm sure.
That is indeed
Principles don't interfere in these situations.
Our brothers in Egypt forced us to do that, so we blame the Egyptian officials.
The dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
"What" (in the context of "What with?")
I'm coming to this topic.
Days of the sweet scent of peace and the cause of peace, and us.
And it had previously been held in Egypt.
And then with us
Because of Israel.
We have a disagreement with him.
You don't have a problem with Adrian.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive.
This is sensitivity.
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
And we always wish for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
One or two
The Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt doesn't want it to be held in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar and that there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we hold it before any scheduled conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first attendees.
They kill people and
And with procrastination
The dispute began.
A small country can't do that.
I know there are brothers in the government, and that's also considered an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said that after
Okay, you're on the island.
The Israelis reported a day ago that there would be an assembly to halt hostilities before any speech, any person, or anything.
What is this?
My brother allowed medicine and food to enter during the beating our brothers endured.
Once they said the door was narrow.
We can't bring in the trucks.
They sometimes tell us there is an agreement from another side and they are required to come.
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
What matters to me is neither Fatah nor Hamas; our concern was for the millions, half-millions, and six-hundred-thousands who are being beaten.
And for those who don't have medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
And Qatar's intervention in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
It's none of your business.
We didn't tell them what Egypt will do to resolve the situation because it's within their authority.
An official said: "We have uncovered a large conspiracy outside this scope."
He still hasn't told us what the plan was.
We mean this officially.
He tells us that Egypt is something great.
Alright, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask the big country for many things.
Because of Egypt, we...
And you were invited to a conference where they were provoked.
We were invited to a conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
And we coordinated and were in agreement.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know that Turkey brought things through Israel.
I'd be happy to see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question and your introduction, it will take a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me.
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now, anger
On the heads of the official Egyptian system
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom, he sought it.
He wants to reconcile.
That's why he intervened and prevented some countries from attending.
And I said these words to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or one of the officials
Among the senior officials
A large country where an official would say that a small country does things like this.
It means you were there.
Taking any role
Darfur is part of Egypt's and Sudan's national security.
The five great powers decided.
Any other country besides Qatar would be fine.
But these sensitivities only make the situation worse. Why do you have to stick your nose into everything near you?
We want to treat this allergy. Take an antihistamine. They need to tell us what the allergy is.
Why allergies?
Some of my brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal holiday.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza, a revolution.
This is an English proverb that says: "Blame the Italians."
Whenever something happens.
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue is resolved locally.
And we didn't succeed.
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first look at the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
And I turned to the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Qatar attempted to reconcile the two parties.
And I think about what Arab issue I can contribute to as much as I can.
Why are you provoking? Why don't you take it at face value?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
And from our perspective
What emerged from his heart.
Let me finish.
When he announced an initiative for reconciliation and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we wished for something good and welcomed it.
In dictatorships
Certainly the Egyptian official who clarified his achievements.
In a report or a television interview or something, what did he respond?
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and connect Arab interests.
Similarly, it is a response to the call referred to by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and others on
They are trying to rectify their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have our mistakes in politics and economics, and no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
Distorting Egypt's relations, undermining its role, and disrupting its connections with Turkey and the European Union.
While initially our numbers were few
If we can pull this off.
This is not correct.
Personal accusations against you.
Paying money to the Shalit detainees so that Qatar can take Shalit and outbid the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, first of all, we didn't pay any money and we didn't tell anyone we were giving money.
Just this situation.
We support Egypt in resolving the same issue, just as we support Egypt and still do in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and for Palestinian institutions, Len remains until the conflict is resolved.
And we said that
"We did it at the Arab League, but he said no, we did it because we believe there are people who don't want it."
But we did it cleverly.
Is he addressing his boss?
Prime Minister
By God, I don't know about a problem.
I don't know which one of them it is.
They decided now in issue 12, which was released exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper last April.
The political leadership in Egypt decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter Al Jazeera Media Network.
It's just a matter of days and everything will be over.
Are you afraid that the island will become a thing of the past?
Do you mean that we are living in a political adolescence stage?
I also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We didn't concede to them, nor did they.
We treated them as brothers.
A compromise for a small state in exchange for concessions from the large state of Egypt.
In Saudi Arabia, there's an important point we need to clarify.
Qatar's relationship with Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we talk.
What is Qatar's relationship with Egypt?
We depend on him a lot.
Let me be honest with you.
Or is it a disagreement on general policy?
I hope it's not a personal issue because we have no personal issues. I've told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you would tell me that there are two problems: Gaza and what else?
This situation has affected all of us greatly.
We want to solve it from a psychological perspective, meaning we want to resolve this crisis.
Published in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it's clear that things have gotten worse and haven't been resolved.
No, no, I didn't hear it.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They reproach us, and this is their right as brothers.
And we criticize them, while it is their right, just as they are our younger brothers.
With the big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big country.
I mean, Egypt is big enough for contentment.
It's not a matter of life and death, but the solution has to come from heaven.
If anyone is waiting for satisfaction, it's us.
"Or are we waiting for a way?"
In Qatar
Are you dealing with non-relatives or siblings?
We are proud of Egypt as a great nation, yes, we are proud of it as a great nation.
But if one cheats another
I know Israel does this to us.
Similarly, the previous American policy under the previous administration was with me or against me.
I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Similarly, if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that even some dictatorships are for a large country.
What drives your policies?
We have no will of our own; only one thing moves us.
This is our internal affair. Qatar is concerned about the internal.
And if we can help the Arab world, we will do so.
What are the sources of power: Al Udeid Air Base and the island.
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God and our trust.
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause any problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want about great Qatar or not.
But we have a point of view.
The first thing we did was expel the Israeli office and close it down.
First, they were saying to close the office, so we told them we would. They got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team called Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans and Europeans, these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
The Managed Ones
What has been done.
This is a flaw, we reached a certain stage and then what?
Tell me now.
How are you going to solve the problem with Egypt?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We think it's important that we read it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on it.
But some of the crew
I have to leave.
Egyptian public opinion is occupied by the government or others or nonsense leadership.
The focus should be on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Honestly, I can't imagine how it's going to happen.
And I know that there's a time for logic
And it will be either one of us at a time.
If it were up to me.
Or from them
Great Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will discover this matter.
Do you mean that life is long after it?
That means we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you're speaking in.
If anyone helps us, we'll help them as much as we can.
Now, Your Highness Sheikh
We weren't used to running.
Unless we are well prepared, we are ready to fight for Egypt.
With Egypt
There are a lot of rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they were affected by this issue.
And for Egyptians who work either in universities or in high positions
You know we're not used to cancelling work and cancelling.
Because these people have nothing to do with this matter.
This is a market with changing demands, they cancel one and bring in another.
This is a matter of supply and demand, in other nationalities it has increased and some have decreased.
Okay, quick answer.
The office was there.
We've disrupted the office atmosphere, so it's best we leave now.
We should have taken advantage of it during the campaign. All our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So let's keep it closed, let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
It was an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we haven't honored her before. When the relations, as they say, were good, we used to honor her, but now they've become a bit difficult.
There's no reason now that should make you open the office during this period.
The office will reopen once the reasons are over.
You made it big.
Who made it the size of Egypt?
Egypt imposed these.
Let me clarify, our relationship with America is strategic.
Some things and this.
What's the most important thing?
In our region, in solving some cases, there were differences of opinion with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
He is serious about advancing the peace process and resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny that.
What's happening in Iran? What impact could it have on the Gulf and on you?
It is up to the Iranians to decide how to solve their problems.
between some
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they'll be able to overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
It's important that our region, the Gulf, shares the same borders with Iran.
Certainly, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervened every time a party wanted to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe Saad Hariri said
Now everything is over, and all that remains is strategic talk between the president.
And Lebanese groups
# How to See
Yemen has no role for you, nor did they just take a stand.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity when almost the whole Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and the only Gulf state that stood by the unity of Yemen.
And in the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Amir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
I explained to him that our goal is to stabilize Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
I didn't respect the agreement, and I don't want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
This is Qatar that took this position and then was accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior Yemeni officials.
Because we don't get involved in these things.
He who is with unity does not stand against it.
And another goal in the interest of Yemen, politically, economically, or otherwise.
We don't have a problem with it, but to be honest, I'm shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the war, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time has run out, but briefly tell me about the problems you faced while searching for solutions. Will you change your policies regarding intervention in the problems of Arab countries?
If they would only listen to me, I see no need for it.
And he was in a great display once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would now be fifty billion dollars, better than a headache.
But I say it with certainty because perhaps the time is now in the Arab world.
What happens in this case?
Many thanks, Your Excellency
Perhaps it will be exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
What happened to the Doha Agreement?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Mandating the committee and providing it with all support
Discussion of Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
When there was Arab consensus
And when we went to New York, we were able to make a more balanced decision.
And we looked for this in Doha, and both parties were eager.
We tried as much as we could not to hear it, or else it wouldn't happen.
Because we know the committee, we know.
The reality is on the ground, and we know where the problem lies after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
And I believe it's a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is a direct reflection of the region's atmosphere on it.
Is it peaceful or non-peaceful?
Lebanon was supposed to be here.
Under these conditions
And unfortunately
External effects
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is a problem, won't be the number one problem.
Alright, Sheikh, I know it might not be the right time yet, but perhaps we can talk about the scenes a bit early.
Why did you come here?
I've kind of stopped talking about the engagement now.
I didn't delay for a single second.
I know exactly what happened; even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
I'll bring up the idea, he agreed and supports it.
Where would all the Lebanese leaders be present?
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each person's area.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
We created this world, but from the start, our idea was different.
And this was the most important decision the two of them had made.
Certainly
And I felt that from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest intermediaries.
Alhamdulillah, I think this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made a great effort.
On both sides.
Reaching a dignified solution for both parties.
And there will be a solution, and no one will lose.
Before you move
I consulted with the Arab League and we found support.
What we've done
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he advised me.
He locked them up and confiscated their phones.
We were able to reach them there, and our brothers in Syria also supported the position.
And I told you from the beginning that the committee couldn't do anything without Arab support.
Why do they want the solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this is tight.
In Somalia, there is tension; in Sudan, there is tension.
A lot of things are happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire
It is in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign intervention.
And we do our part.
Sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I believe that this is a subject.
At some point, you have to discuss.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reforms between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
Self-review is needed in the Arab world.
Due to Arabic variations.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we've tried this.
Seventy-seven Wars
When Arabs agree on a solution to an issue.
I think I'm interested.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
"On both sides, if"
Prevail with wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we, in the Arab world, face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our backyard.
We have neither power nor influence.
And what is the way we can stop playing in the arena of Arab countries?
At the least, the Arabs have the minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
As we were watching
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust among us, trust is missing between Arab countries.
And the Arab states
Betrayal is a kind of treachery.
What is the word for envy?
This is a case that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think.
Alright, will you make this request and actually ask for an Arab summit?
We suffer when others suffer and rejoice when others rejoice.
He butt in halfway through the conversation.
Is it possible for me to take a role to mend the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
We are eager to find solutions, and I am sure of their wisdom.
They might reach a mutual understanding.
There are many cases among them.
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relations improved.
Both parties need a step.
But I can't confirm that this is what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the existence of a general Arab awakening.
But what I can say is what happened in Lebanon.
It could be interpreted on the ground as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
Perhaps there is an American-Iranian escalation, maybe there are other cases.
Are you going to be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can only bring food and medicine.
It provides electricity to people.
We in Qatar are ready and He is always there.
More than 1.5 million Palestinians are besieged.
And we don't want them to take up arms or receive support.
They can't be doing all this.
And there's no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Crescent to deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we just provide them with food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them could continue.
I hope that Palestinians on both sides put the national interest first.
Leave the illusion behind.
The current Palestinian dispute is a deep wound.
Found a solution
But they didn't commit.
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
They should ask until they return to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
And resolve this disagreement.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties.
We are not part of it and we do not accept to be part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with him.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but that doesn't harm them or us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Cooperation with Iran and its peaceful neighborhood
But why do you say that Qatar is not a party?
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
No, never.
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanon file if there's no objection.
Frankly, sir, we faced a big obstacle, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some people linked what happened to what was said.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but that's what happened.
This is what led you to this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul, I knew it even if he had specific dates beforehand.
I found out there were negotiations.
Continuing to search for a solution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
Change negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led to
For a positive outcome, we met with some parties from certain quarters.
And we started talking.
In this paper, there is an Arab and Qatari approach.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper?
And let's talk about the topic point by point.
In the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
We got rid of this handicap.
And he was free from it.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
What do you consider your role to be now?
Listen, the most important thing is that we stay away from the lights.
I have no territorial ambitions.
Or even control another state or something because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we are able to contribute to solving issues with our fellow peers.
But in the Arab world, the most important thing is...
Let us have countries that belong to us.
We want them to do something, and that's important.
Allowed some small countries to play this role and supported them.
Some things are excellent, some are good, and some are less than good.
The last question, Your Excellency the Minister.
What is the main priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security, not enmity reform.
Confronting Israel
We stop the play at the Arab court.
What are we fixing in Arab countries? Our problems.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
Calming things down
# Development Goals
But if we designed
Unless you have hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the ongoing war on Gaza
We start by requesting a meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
It's as if you've changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be present in this program.
Although the humanitarian situation
Confronting our brothers in Gaza
The conditions that make us do a lot.
Qatar ignored the Arab summit.
# Indeed, when we previously went with the idea of the Arab summit
Security Council resolution but also through
They are not to be underestimated.
Let me say it in another sentence.
And we are disciplined.
The street can't take it anymore, if we, as officials responsible for the Arab street, are lenient.
He won't be able to bear it.
When we were in Egypt
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it is possible that we can hold a meeting.
We will cling to it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if they have a point of view in a meeting.
And what's the solution to the problem?
Because it will be solved.
This topic is important.
Because our goal is not advertising, our goal is to meet.
So the summit ignored it.
We even ask ourselves
We'll go press the other poor guy.
The former president and what followed, and the Security Council resolution, but let's stick to the topic of the Arab Summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We found that most of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And how would I know what they mean by moderation?
We are the only nation.
The Arab nation only, if we go to any country in Asia or Latin America
Unsolved
They were classified as moderate countries.
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Is he going to abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Do we interfere in the affairs of the Palestinians in any way?
No country allows interference, whether for good or for evil.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Do we accept them as part of the Arab body?
People, we're facing a big problem. We need to unite and stand against this. We can't remain silent and let them control us. We must assert ourselves and fight for our rights.
Perfect, if we go to the Security Council.
There is no Security Council resolution.
I hope that after Israel finishes its mission
Okay, the second Arab ministerial meeting I was invited to attend.
The period dominated by discussions, disagreements, and sharp altercations
At an important point
This is not what matters.
When we call for a meeting
About stations
There's no more peace.
Are the ministers ready for this?
Because there's a party that tells you we have to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace initiatives with Israel.
We say we're at a party, you say we're losing in this.
In a greater loss than the one we're experiencing now, but we were always respectful, polite, and adhered to the decisions made since the truce.
She says that squabbles are unimportant.
There was someone who wished Hamas would be destroyed and things like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a disagreement between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not all people
I don't want to talk about others.
It's important that we are men of our word and men of our state.
We are making the policies of our countries.
Who's doing these things on his own account?
I believe
I don't think they respect us in the end.
Is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone, I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the disagreement here is whether Israel will implement the decision immediately.
We can say there's a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I'm sure there will be difficulties.
No interrogation from the international community, even if it happened.
You are shy.
The situation
Check if they did something to the Jew and the Israeli.
They take their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs didn't go to the Security Council
They agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try to influence us.
Because we are in the Arab world and there are a lot of people, and you can see how the Arab street is reacting to this.
This decision is important.
Regarding the topic of calling our bosses one after another.
In the end, they said there was nothing, which is a lie.
If we're like Germany now, we won't demand.
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who attacked, but say you have incorrect information.
And killed one hundred thousand.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We Arabs, some of us.
I'm so tired, how about you?
His presentation.
On your path to self-fulfillment, as if destiny had mapped out your journey, you find yourself facing great challenges. It is God's will, so fear nothing.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur."
Arabs considered, or some of them considered, Resolution 242.
And our brothers worked hard to get the decision.
Issued by the Security Council
I'm not saying it was a win or not.
And what leads to...
We assume that victory
What are we going to do?
We're supposed to stick to the remaining decision.
Just to reassure you, we are adhering to the decision.
Unfortunately, you will agree to the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
It means "so we" or "that means we" in English.
Do you have an alternative, or do you want something better than my ministerial council?
I don't think the Arab nation
By the way, I'm open to alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
Gaza Siege
For various political reasons
To make one group dominate another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
Let's start trying to make plans.
Once they held a meeting, I don't know if it was Arab-European intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And if they do it, I mean we're involved.
In execution
What do they want from us in the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Certainly, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The followers because this case from Gaza started two years ago, not now.
I wanted to talk about the subject two years ago, but precisely on the topic of the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Source and no outlet.
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
Everyone needed to have the same viewpoint.
We don't all have to share the same opinion, but I think those who left made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, and you mentioned "parties."
One team defeated another that participated in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with the statements, hints, or accusations that have been made here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with everything that's happening now in Gaza.
We are partially informed.
On the subject, let me tell you we're not entirely sure.
But I know.
Palestinian conflict
Refuel at the Arab and international levels
And if they had been supplied with fuel, they would not have differed much.
And after the elections...
And Hamas came and took over the power.
By a majority
We should have given them a chance and seen.
They want reform, but until now, the revolutionaries only know the rifle and fighting.
But the day they came
At the Arab level, some of our brothers thought that these radical movements should not come to power.
Some say an assault has just occurred.
Was it Hamas that broke the ceasefire, or was it the Arabs from Gaza who broke the ceasefire?
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain hungry for two years.
This is normal.
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't concern me in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
And then who decides?
This or those, not every state with sovereignty gets to choose.
Our government
Is the main problem?
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we're just tired, we're tired of fueling the disagreement.
But it's clear that we were asked to make one group excel over another because of this group.
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
All that happened leads to
Even the promises they made to the party to provide them with a decent life.
They didn't do anything to them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts that took place to stop what is happening, according to what you were saying.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has not yet accepted.
And in the Egyptian initiative,
And Egypt is in Cairo.
The Egyptians' efforts
No, by God, it's not beating around the bush.
This is required for an important role.
Similarly, Egypt's borders are adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
We
And we won't stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we are calling on people to stop the fighting in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
It has to be.
And therefore we ask them for a great and constant role.
What was announced?
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give a chance for success or to study.
I think his chances of success are great.
If the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt can
Bring Palestinian opinions closer together.
And it is the one who is affected in Gaza who should discuss the initiative.
Because he's the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
Upon the issuance of Resolution 1860
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we are in.
We don't want to hear any party.
But I wanted it when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the league, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't give up power.
Let us have our goal, and not build our policy.
To stay in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't read its articles.
Do you think, in principle, that this could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860, as some people have suggested?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day passes.
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
So neither we nor the Israelis want to delay on this matter. Once they complete their mission, we will propose this initiative.
And I am sure that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt know this and are thinking about it carefully.
I want to clarify everything I've said.
Now we need to solve the problem.
And it's not what Israel wants it to be.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Is it expressed?
Empty Arab air
Undoubtedly, it's a distinguished position.
And he has an Arabic depth.
His door is open to disabled Arabs.
We know there is an Arab disability.
Some of it was due to disagreements.
Some believe their viewpoint is the best because of their perspective.
And another person thinks their opinion is better.
Where is the conscience? How do you allow people to respect and acknowledge that there is an Arab decision?
Or they'll come in one by one.
Someone else says, "No problem, let's give them an extra two or three days so we can contact them, bring the guys, and fix the situation."
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we engage with them.
At the Arab level
But still
At least we tell them no.
Within the required Qatari position, there are positions such as, we will return to this point later but
At the same time, I heard a violin in the field.
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
Firstly, what Brother Khalid Meshaal said was unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit down with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Setting conditions Israel also imposes its conditions.
Let them impose conditions, but they are not allowed to impose conditions and Israel can?
What do you think of this Arabic gift?
We are sheep, and we shouldn't listen to the crowd. Once De Gaulle said, "I don't listen."
It is quite different; first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
With allies or without, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
Now what are we talking about?
Is this an Arab gift that we're supposed to give?
Heads of state must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all these demonstrations we've seen.
These classes can meet the demands.
Similarly, many of those criticizing Qatar in this case are also demanding
What's the actor talking about? The office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
We sever relations, we go with all Arab states.
To cut the relationship, all ties, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They want Qatar to sacrifice its soul.
We
And this is more important than the relationship.
It's not just this decision, but this decision and even tougher ones.
More than this decision.
We need a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells anyone else for spiritual, material, or summoned gains.
Yes, before we close the file on this matter, some countries have taken individual steps.
Hassan Chavez is a different matter, he has disputes with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five permanent members and these are their films.
We're done, and now the street knows better.
"With the high ceiling, Your Highness Sheikh"
Or calling on Lebanese forces to confront the Israeli aggression, and so on.
Do you think that if it were presented in a single Arabic framework, it could succeed?
But we demand an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready for war.
We don't motivate.
How will you unite Syria, Lebanon, and the Arab countries that don't communicate with each other?
It should be.
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current state of politics between Arab countries.
It's still here, but I think it's expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know the structure of the Lebanese society.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if it regained its territories.
The situation in Gaza is going to change, they said.
Besieged from all sides.
This siege
Bring another nature.
Yes, I mean here Israel's goals, that is, Israel's interim goals.
A day for one person, a day for punishment, and a day for pleasure.
An example of that is what happened in Lebanon; for them, it's not a good example.
The solution is the sample that happened in Lebanon.
He considers it good.
Puzzle
The problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than in Lebanon.
They disagree with each other, should we return to our land today or tomorrow?
Their disputes revolve around power.
Separation of powers
And those who differ do so because they are closer to each other in thought.
I understand you mean "more than the Lebanese intellectual."
That's why the solution is much easier.
And here's the problem.
His Highness Sheikh
That means we only have a few minutes if we finish the topic to the point we can reach.
And a diplomat.
How can this process be completed?
Gaza is on the verge of a Palestinian uprising.
Let me tell you.
Accept or reject
Where's the help?
He didn't walk with us.
It's an Arab failure.
Regarding the strategy
But from the Palestinian side
There were efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Why not before now?
It's not a matter of initiative as much as it is how we feel.
We help those who solve the problem without mentioning Qatar, as some people have an issue with naming Qatar.
We won't hold a summit because there's already a summit scheduled for March.
If we take an initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And we do not pressure them.
Because history is relentless if we pressure them.
We are going through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress, and we appeal to our Arab brothers to help as much as they can in this matter.
And with God's will, we'll rise above competition.
Arab competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at a certain stage.
And these are our problems, we fight with each other and disagree.
I don't want to go through that.
"I think we'll be crying on the nineteenth of next month, of course, given the Arab situation."
As you know, as mentioned, and as Your Excellency clarified.
Is the Arab climate entirely supportive? Is it the first economic conference?
His Highness
And of course, we attend any summit held in a brotherly country.
And we have no objection to attending any summit.
But I don't want to become a political football.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
This is late even if it's after ten days.
You're talking about the Palestinians after they were bombed for twenty-five days?
"بتكون" translates to "You will be" in English.
Do they say that Arabs couldn't unite?
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this conference is scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think we
The Arab streets are against us.
In our own unique way
And thus
Enter in peace.
That's it, guaranteed.
For this session
Thank you to the audience for following along.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues with safety.
A few days ago, we celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a special law project.
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He also delivered over seventy-seven lectures, workshop papers, and presentations, and published articles in Arab and international journals.
Let's first agree on the term currently in use.
Should we say "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities" as you mentioned?
Good evening
Taken from a culture of human rights or a legal rights culture for people with disabilities.
Because he treated disabled people as people first and foremost.
Human beings
This led to his disability due to his attempts to adapt to society.
The medical concept was prevalent at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Special education and training appeared.
This category has become
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
What are the approved rules derived from?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And accelerated the process until the emergence of the international covenant, which was legally binding and distinguished by rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or main rule for this term.
This deals with people as if they were human beings, as people.
Is there a change in the community's perspective?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
The Arab world is distinctive or different.
This, legal orientations include human rights and exist for example in Africa.
In Latin America, but for compelling reasons, the lack of financial resources, isn't that right?
Certainly, that's what I wanted to say, that culture exists but there is a lack of resources, and sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes, laws are simple.
Unfortunately, awareness is a bit low and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities from developed countries are of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment.
During my visit to Darfur
Or with mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
Disabilities will be added in remote and distant areas.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Rather, establishing quite a few religious centers.
They started building rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things we are grateful for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Developing an agenda
Or include these humanitarian organizations' agendas to include those centers.
Amidst the decline in the status of people with disabilities in the world
I can't reach her, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there was a decline in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
Placed within a social context and within a political and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be
While they are among the marginalized groups.
In a country like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot categorically assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it was applied in reality on the ground in a real way, and if I wanted to give an example, I would say
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities and health issues are included in this strategy, and there are other programs as well.
We tried to include them as well.
Within the jobs of organizations on the ground
Kamal Kirou is with us now from Syria, welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kirou.
Hello Salaman, sorry, please come in Salaman.
My greetings to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
Is there an intellectual barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
Cognitive blockage means that the healthy individual was the result of what became a pressure factor leading to cognitive blockage.
My son became disabled due to torture and imprisonment. He suffered from mental retardation and has been undergoing treatment for six years now.
I know that there are around four hundred children and disabled people in prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know them as they know their own children.
And all meaning is lost when they don't make an effort.
And in the West, there are values.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not follow Islam, so their wisdom is not to be taken from them.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest to comment.
In the conversations, Solomon wondered if there was any intellectual disability.
Yeah, I'm part of the global ranking.
For individuals with special needs, certainly intellectual and mental disability as it is also called.
Are there any sensory impairments related to vision or hearing, or physical impairments among these disabilities?
Certainly, as mentioned, disability is...
Action and reaction that occur within a social context.
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Surely, dealing with the disability took a long time.
And even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to address and work on...
In other words, it's everyone's right.
Len provides for them.
And various qualifying aspects to ensure their enrollment in schools and also the organization of work.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were improvements.
Especially after the reform
They are generally present in this international committee.
I'm still, I mean as a special rapporteur.
The fact of my work, and this was positive for me even if it wasn't directly related.
Who supported this position?
I've seen her in many meetings, for example, the international conference.
For the rights of people with disabilities
These fetters or these defects hindered him.
Example regarding legal capacity.
This is one of the most important points in the world of disability.
The United Nations unfortunately delayed it a bit during preparation and drafting.
For organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll end with this.
Governments and non-governmental organizations from member states of the United States of the world.
We talked about a second survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
Do their agendas include programs for people with special needs, and to what extent?
If budgets are set, will there be participation for people with disabilities?
Human rights
And it's not just development issues.
We're receiving more calls. With us now is the Egyptian Nagi from Algeria. Welcome, Nagi.
Upon you as well
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly should be blamed.
I want to ask, I am originally physically disabled.
Okay, I'll ask her. Naji Machri from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello to Al-Halbawi from Greece.
Good evening, madam, good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even taking them on seasonal tourism, this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
All we're talking about is unproductive discussion. Thank you.
Hessa's sister mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every organization in the world.
This should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
He faces a large deficit of disabled people, war victims, and others.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji, an Egyptian, was wondering and mentioned his problem: he is disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning throughout Algeria.
Needs are met within the community by the community.
Are these the same rights that should come to any other person?
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
So, I really call from here, from this platform, governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are on current agendas.
No, there's no need to make new devices.
The needs of the disabled person must be met, or there is no need for this if the state is capable.
They extend and must commit to implementing.
I advise him first to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it's within my national scope and should be within this range.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without actually committing to it.
And here we ask a question from one of the callers, why are there no laws?
It is an undeniable fact that we live in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and many truths.
Certainly, many agreements and undoubtedly many treaties do not contain a literal obligation.
Or an ideal commitment from many countries that have joined numerous conventions, such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know.
The question is only about adopting an agreement and arranging it.
First, we will ensure there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, and then it gradually grows until it reaches the entire society.
As well as our commitment to prepare and submit reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of awareness.
The reports you worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations were...
Yes, I am interested in what I have seen and noticed.
It has a comparative advantage in agreeing on the rights of persons with disabilities.
I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important for people with disabilities to be...
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say.
Mr. Naji will speak about the subject. Welcome to Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
With me, Professor Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
Led by Her Highness Sheikh Hissa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
I am a deaf person from Qatar.
The truth is that Sheikh Hessa has a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is in fact
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries implement this international treaty.
People with special needs require the provision of services, and it is essential that...
The fact that there is someone capable of activating this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
We'll be right back to continue our discussion after a short break. Stay tuned.
Send and share your opinions on important issues in economic, political, and sports affairs, and a variety of other topics.
Al Jazeera Mubasher SMS Service
Dear viewers, welcome back and our guest today, Sheikh Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disabling an international support fund
Disability, and it is obligatory for all countries to provide funds. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
And, unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Mission to monitor the implementation of normative rules
When I was working six years, there was no real support.
Only from China and Austria
And I always mean, I thank this country for its support.
The main sponsor of the country is my own, Qatar.
Praise be to God who established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
I mean, as we mentioned at the beginning, this point is always up for discussion.
Terms of Ordinary People
Slovenian calls the care for people with disabilities or the care for the disabled?
That means if there was a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
Under all circumstances, in all categories
Disabled refugee and displaced child and woman.
All of this can lead to a degree called...
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And in voices, they always ask and never get tired or weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry.
For the benefit of these programs and projects.
An example of what he has presented, and I thank him greatly from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what I told you regarding the payment of financial dues.
Funds to assist people with disabilities - do they only include developing countries and Arab states or what?
Even developed countries don't provide.
I mean, the person before me, who is Swedish.
Also some countries of the European Union
Certainly in many countries, especially in the Arab region, it might not be possible.
Even if he is aware of the existence of this special course
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, has become many promises, but unfortunately it was just one country.
We're talking about the Arab region, but
We have with us Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Welcome, Hamad!
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Hello, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa
Close to ten
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role for a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean sometimes even when we maintain
What is your job in relation to the daughters of Qatari women?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, Karwan Bahja from Kuwait, welcome.
As they say, Sheikhah Hissa.
Why don't we leave our oil in its place?
Those with special needs, we can include them.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
If we are truly believers
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikh Hissa for all her efforts and what she presented during her term as a Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her, and our thanks to the State of Qatar for all it has provided to people with determination.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Dr. Wasila.
Peace be upon you
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question concerns prevention.
They say prevention is better than cure.
At another level of disability, regardless of wars and traffic accidents
The genetic level could be a result of families that practice consanguineous marriages.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leads to disability
Many thanks to our flag-bearer Chérif from Tunisia, now I'll go back to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, he was wondering.
Where can a girl with a mental disability go?
And where should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities as mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For the schools
Previously, there was
I do not mean private education in the Ministry of Education, but the current Higher Council.
The standard-bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
and scientific papers, and so on.
I only work with organizations that focus on disability, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All these issues attracted many campaigns and programs to reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Develop healthy strategies.
Based on awareness.
Showing the risks of marrying relatives
and genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
It's just habits and routines, but it definitely takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is essential to have a legal commitment, in other words,
Yes, the rooster suggested allocating one percent of the budgets of Arab countries.
To help the disabled, let me first
Yes, within the framework of the World Health Organization, a statistical estimate is applied to the entire world.
Forty or around forty million disabled people
Their group is made up of women.
But these numbers are doubling.
Like studying in South Africa where they observed and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the Iraq War and the Gaza War.
For every person who dies, three disabled people take their place.
And as the Arab region became the undisputed conflict zone
Even Karwan Behjat's suggestion
One percent is not enough.
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Honestly and truly, I don't think it fits with
Addressing their problems and needs
Confirmation that the disabled are the most neglected.
Disabled people are generally not counted in government studies.
True, and this is linked to the culture and societal restrictions sometimes.
When conducted by census
Concerned authorities
There is a disabled person at home.
Is there a disabled person or not?
The relevant department and through the concerned individuals there.
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, male or female?
Did he get help or not?
Even if the figures are correct, we haven't arrived at an accurate conclusion.
Similarly, attention and care must be continuous. With us is Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with a disability.
And I thank His Highness, the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, on embracing this classification.
I am very proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her important role
Hello, Latifa Al-Musaferi
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Messafer from Qatar is with us now, Naseem.
Abdulkareem is from Jordan, welcome Nesim.
Walk, Kareem, we can hear you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
God bless you, I have a straightforward intervention.
First of all, I am an audio specialist and I have almost four years of experience in the State of Qatar.
We had a month-long awareness campaign for speech and hearing issues.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for the deaf.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I lived there for almost three years.
It really offers new and nice services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether material, moral, or non-material.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
In addition to our private institutes
They receive excellent support.
Alright, Karim, do you have a direct question? Due to time constraints, I'm afraid not.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, there are excellent services, and I believe they are excellent.
Can you comment on the viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I'll come back to the topic of the agreement later.
What is necessary, obligates itself as soon as it is approved and joined.
It is the duty of the state or these institutions.
Because it is based on the issue of people's rights, regardless of
And frankly, what?
What will you do during this period for people with disabilities and why?
I wish it would happen now.
Certainly, I wish either.
I hope that this research or study is measured and that more high-quality research is conducted in this field.
It also became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have roles, it's not just about rights, they get their rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We have now the introduction from the League and Cup Channel, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the distinguished captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Anyone can congratulate publicly, Lana, please.
I had a studio open for five hours and two hours the day before.
Congratulations to Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim.
Yes, definitely, Lana. You are from the sports field and one of the experts in this area, with extensive knowledge of these lines and this field.
Because even our file
A worthy competitor, meaning we deserve the difference of six votes between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That was because our file was rich and comprehensive and enjoyed the support of many ambassadors, very strong support, for example, the fields.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there was some %pw, like America.
In some countries, it's already available; they don't need to build stadiums and prepare special projects for this event.
Because they were already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I believe this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
The economic, political, and health sectors are affected, I expect.
Just, you are athletes.
What does this achievement mean to you?
Certainly a great achievement for us, even you saw how the non-athletic people were extremely happy.
God willing, Ali, tell me about the moment of victory.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
I'm driving the car and listening to the radio.
The moment they announced Qatar and...
We both screamed, and naturally the skylight was open.
My friend stuck his body out of the sunroof of the car.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned on the flashers and started celebrating by ourselves.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on the event greatly.
Lana, you were definitely involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
Delegations and media from all over the world attended.
He became a leading teacher, very clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Sure, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I believe that responsibility must be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Oh Ali, did they mention the required attributes to join the league?
Now there are more sports events coming up.
And we need to prepare a strong generation.
It then had strong foundations and well-planned mathematical strategies for football.
So what are the rules and foundations that the player must possess?
And I believe that professionalism encompasses everything from
Difficult, continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help him exert his utmost efforts in matches or training sessions.
I believe every stage has a unique advantage.
It has a unique feeling and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
Very sweet
It keeps you fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Everyone watches football matches, so you automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Are media workers confined to one side?
What's holding you back in one part?
This is an open field, not just for football.
All of this is exercise, but exercise is good.
Ali, there are still important issues we want to discuss.
Would you have wished to go back to your age ten years ago to reach 2022?
Yes, you wished for it.
Of course, everyone dreams of this, especially since it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone who watches a World Cup match will be happy, imagine if he were playing in the World Cup.
I hope they meet the expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love being with you.
As I said just now, I'm on vacation now, but
For her return to the leagues after twelve years of absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
God willing, Qatar TV has become like a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
"We are brave and, God willing, will win many different awards."
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there? How are you? I hope you're well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Of course, yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
I mean, I think some of the guys who were watching us think that you...
Required
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I have a good chance in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
I was able to take a place in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
Praise be to God, my situation with the team is excellent.
How can we make sports a social topic?
In addition to Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Everything arrives, everything is complementary to sport.
Women have a role in all fields of sport.
And it expands, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, realizes the importance of sport.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation grows up, but we must raise a generation aware of sports from a young age.
We understand Aspire, Aspire is an effective building.
It is essential for the new athletic generation.
We must be determined and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we attract the audience to participate in all the different games of the club matches?
Frankly, the problem of low attendance is one of the issues we face in the Qatari league.
The problem, however, lies in attendance; the Qatar Football Association has yet to find a way to attract the audience.
What methods do we use to attract them to attend football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending classes.
The media plays a crucial role, by the way, in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or a point system here.
No, no, when united there's a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs, %pw, organize some activities and events.
For attendance, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
They love what they do and believe in their abilities. As I said, they need financial support, but moral support is much more important.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
Okay, we want to hear your final thoughts on Qatar's win to host 2022, Lana, please.
I want to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
God willing, Captain Ali, your final word that you want to say in this interview.
A thousand congratulations, and may success always be with you.
Thank you, Captain and Knowledgeable Player. I wish you success in your sports career and life. May God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs are popular these days; however, they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people are singing an Arabic word or English words.
Today we're discussing this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We get to know them better through the interview that brings us together directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For many years, a new style of singing dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
I'm from the West, specifically America, which is the rap.
Before we start talking about rap music,
The use of any word without any reserve is boldness.
Anyone can rap.
To write on the words,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
So we know all this important information and details from two experts in this field.
Make a nice team.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Hello with us, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And surely through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get yourself into this mess?
We discovered that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Representing the citizen.
Including joy, sadness, and political themes.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And sometimes, I think it's from an artist painting a picture and a poet writing a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think that Qatari society, Gulf society, accepts this type of language?
2010
Do you think people like to buy rap music CDs?
A mix of ages
In many families and among many people, listening is more prevalent than before.
There was something like a website.
How many are there in this band so far?
This means you can speak, write poetry, and perform rap.
As the singer, the rapper,
It's him who sometimes plays, write the words.
Okay!
I ask, listen, and tell him I recorded this song.
Present, all these songs that you produced, Salman, from Youssef, from anyone in the same band.
I thought about it on a CD and being available in the markets,
But you know, if I'm alone, it means I'll have to produce the album and release it on the market, and that's difficult, with all the commercial recording and procedures.
Come on, why didn't you think about it? You're twenty-five years old, and you can't clap with one hand.
It is necessary for two, if God wills, you will have twenty-five hands, may God protect you all, young men and brothers.
You can create a CD and market this CD through multiple websites on the internet.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think there are 13 songs.
Registration is not like it is now.
Yeah, a bit old, but it was clear.
It has low quality, not like now, but it's clear.
Burned almost fifty CDs.
There's rap, I can't say there isn't because there might be young people who have known this art for over ten years.
Nothing was as strong as the recording and I believe the distribution during that time, it's different now.
Especially since there is a musical diversity, a wide range of techno music genres these days.
Halriel and the artists produce a nice collection of songs.
And we also want to talk about the parties you've attended.
See, the party we attended in Doha was one of a kind.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
Let's go check on the attendees.
We were surprised; we didn't expect such a large number.
We were surprised by the number of families who attended.
More than the youth
The organization was amazing.
We were a bit nervous because it was the first time it happened in Doha.
We didn't expect this much attendance.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It took a long time, so they became many songs.
Alright, let's hear something, or lyrics to a song composed by you, that the audience, especially the youth, would like.
We'll hear a few words from the audience.
Can we hear it directly?
Take your time.
Go, Salem.
The problem is that it's random.
We hear.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
It's nice to attend the program in the morning.
Salman is an expert; this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if they don't like it.
They have no idea about it.
The words are random.
Okay, for the songs you've presented, give me some of your old lyrics.
See, not all songs are random, or as they say in English, "freestyle."
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We say, good morning my country, good morning health program.
We are live on television, for the viewers.
See what one plus one equals.
Together from the morning of Doha
The beautiful song I just heard
I insisted that the youth spread it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate it. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone creates themselves.
He won't find it easy to execute.
Everyone writes.
Sure, I think every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
Anyone can write about it out of love for sports.
Countries or Love
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
Everyone is awaiting Doha's splendor to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be celebrations on the Corniche.
To celebrate that occasion
We're broadcasting this segment live.
From the welcome of the Asian Cup, Doha
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these live clips together.
Reception, attendance, our children, the students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha Airport this morning to continue the journey.
Preparations for hosting the massive continental event
Go and bring back our guests Yusuf and Salman, whose presence brings us joy.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it that?
Currently, frankly, we
We're preparing for a party, but it's not certain.
Okay, you're working on a party that will be announced, God willing, by Youssef.
If God wills, but we're not sure, we're still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you with all our hearts.
O Salman, where do all of you, twenty-five people, gather?
Where do you meet, and how do you gather all the ideas?
Sure, there are shared songs.
There's no need for anyone like Salman or Yusuf or any of you to sing a whole song.
There must be cooperation among all of you.
It's difficult to get all twenty-five together in one place.
Never contact Youssef, and the guys, and ask them to gather in one place.
Contemplate the song and the lyrics.
And there's a second way.
I register my spot.
And he continued.
Record it and send it to me.
And see other experiences.
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Sure, always.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone and the same words,
We're not producing anything new, we want to do something.
So we benefit from them a little.
Yes, in the Gulf, there's a large group of Gulf youth.
In a primitive way, let's look at the report together, benefit and enjoy, let's see it together.
The talents some people have are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail
This is 150 kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has excellent experience and skills.
From the discovery of shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than a hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the suitable location to dig the well, with the expert, you can.
"Where are you from?"
Groundwater sites
Since time immemorial
Our parents and grandparents
They consulted experts to find the wells.
Dig
Abu Ibrahim's methods for finding groundwater
What are modern technologies?
Soil testing in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And beneath it are rivers.
Pomegranate seeds
Pomegranate or fig branches
Now, the process of discovering water channels is applied scientifically.
To close, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back
Ha, from here, we start putting a mark.
And here, the river ends.
Wade needs a lot of experience and patience.
To be able to know the sensitivity of a motion.
I've been to many places.
Means 95% success.
Certainly, with this method and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
It's strange, to be honest, the success rate among those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
By searching for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to Allah, who taught man the unknown. This report is from Saudi Arabia.
Those who have their own band and more than one CD.
Online or on the phone?
Sometimes competitions are organized between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song about a stronger subject.
Addressing an issue, etc., in various matters.
See me as a role model.
God wants
And at the same time, we want
Broadcast a wide range of songs
As much as possible
From time to time, let's keep in touch with you.
So we can keep up with the band's latest news.
Let's just focus on the band's name.
These are rappers.
Let's go back to our guests on the corniche and enjoy the nice weather.
We are with you live via this direct link.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you welcome the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
# Social and psychological problems of youth Youth face great challenges.
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, hello again.
Sometimes the subscription ends.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a group, you need to improve yourselves, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You'll find us among the top search results.
Organize and work together on this great production.
You compose and match images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or just download it from YouTube and video sites with tracking.
Some people have done it before.
There are a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as not having a company to adopt you, or a website.
You really need a place where you can all come together as a band.
What are your wishes that you want to achieve and surpass?
"Who will take care of us?"
Save us an album.
I wish it becomes official.
Because we've spent five years.
Weather, no longer
Yeah, we've collaborated on some things, some series.
We hope it improves.
And we will have someone to support us and be with us.
Yeah, Salman, we also want to know what your wishes are.
My only wish is to produce a video.
We wish you good luck.
We hope all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is very beautiful and popular art.
And carry a message, as I just said
Good luck, I wish you all success.
Hello to the group, and we wish you success.
We'll end with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is the KWD DJGMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Kai coming, Madame Bobo with SKT one hot on the body.
We say, good morning my country, good morning health program.
We are live on television, for the viewers.
Don't forget, the show airs at nine thirty, everyone has to watch.
See what one plus one equals.
Together from the morning of Doha
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
It might happen again and be used at home.
Shopping cart or purchase cart
I'm buying from the supermarket.
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A big house will reveal the components of this product.
This is also an excellent and practical idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart recognizes the item.
Facilitate the purchase for the buyer.
He can see all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
The details are complete.
Ambition, no, for example in many projects, almost four or five.
This addresses traffic issues.
Traffic congestion causes many problems, such as the parking problem, and creative solutions are always best.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are more surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if I should mention some of the projects I've submitted or not.
For example, for underground transportation, the creative idea is
If the man leaves his house, he will find an elevator.
And they meet at one point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, this is for example like an ATM.
For the woman, for example, I have a card.
Enter it, and I say I need a T-shirt.
This is an example of some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
This is missing, like the office key.
We have a primary goal set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza.
His Highness's wife
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
For 300 selected children
Let's leave two speakers and orators.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be present and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve this core idea.
Children's skills are different and diverse.
Personal development
Present, do you have any collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Certainly, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
This is all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing these talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Innovation Center for Girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers has a very big role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in articulating Qatar's vision.
And train the children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, as every program is built on institutional partnerships.
According to the opinion of the head of projects and establishments.
And what changes?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are currently, in partnership with Katara, preparing projects that will be ready for launch in the next two months.
Certainly, there are many programs with collaboration.
# Reading: An Endless Pleasure
Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
As we implement, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the future generation and youth
What is your final word for the families and children who are watching now and are interested in joining the center?
More than what we offer them now.
Sometimes, our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We should take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It is important that we take care of children and provide them with attention.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Help him.
Encourage him, so we encourage the parents.
Pay more attention to a child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
We took a tour of the exhibition and watched their projects.
We lived the dream.
My dreams and thoughts were of a wide imagination.
And dreams become reality; many of them have come true and become a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there success.
Our hearts are with you.
God wants
Of different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is considered a pioneer and deserves to be implemented.
Talking more about this national exhibition.
And the children's cultural center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, please briefly tell us about the exhibition.
There were a lot of activities, for sure. What do you say about them?
The children displayed a new style of expressing their love and loyalty to their homeland.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
Touring the exhibition
Reaches twenty and thirty
We started training children to visualize Qatar in 30 and 20 along all three of its axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to innovate
I think they have an open mind.
But why should we help him?
I suppose their minds will develop more and more.
Sir, the exhibition was inaugurated under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow."
Our slogan is the dreams of a generation.
"Be part of Qatar's future, Qatar tomorrow."
We felt that when we were walking with the kids, when the boy said to the minister,
I want you to launch my project. I invite you to visit my project on the twentieth or the thirtieth.
A boy thinking about the future after twenty years.
They express their love for their country in the field they are interested in.
There must be activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won a Science Stars award.
Some of them were winners of the first prize from the Arab League.
Sure, all the children.
On the side, there were various displays on a fixed schedule.
To present the projects they have accomplished.
In a vast existence, a uniquely remarkable presence.
Stars of science
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
Innovative peoples or innovative forest or reserve
And we also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and their vision for Qatar's future.
This is an idea for 2030.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea to "2030"?
The main idea is the presence of an electronic chip inside the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee might see the ball's movement.
Or that the playground is changing through this electronic slide.
The one who is playing in the ball.
In creative ideas, I affirm the main idea, some people might ask.
And projects
We always say, "We've reached this stage."
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express their love for their country through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, attached to something he loves, all of this is an achievement.
Offered help, we thank him for that.
Which is currently in the development stage
Also supported by the public, committee, and some officials.
The start, no, it was the second, because this girl
Pipes, channels for underground attendance, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
A huge reserve forest
A place visited by tourists to see animals and reptiles.
Sensors were also installed on some animals to examine their condition.
In addition to the marine environment, the entry method is also innovative.
One of the reasons she won was her vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
Someone else spoke about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth
And many tourist ideas.
Very interesting
Perhaps this is a need in their minds, at this time, maybe in twenty or thirty years.
And in the future, it will be achieved.
Two projects and a project.
It was adopted by the science club; they said these are the projects we need to work on.
In a project, it is water that is not required from air conditioners.
Let's read an Arab newspaper.
The article says, Qatar University celebrates graduation.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Higher Education Council
Dr. Sheikhah bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and the University of Calgary
There's also good news about our students.
An academic achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered one of the young actors who are rising strongly in the Qatari dramatic scene.
How long, O strings and colored threads.
The actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is considered one of the actors who made their own success.
If I don't convince you,
He won't be chosen to work on what's happening inside Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Tsahef Part Two".
We are pleased to have him as our guest this morning.
So that we can talk to him about his participation in these two projects and about his overall experience.
Hello and good morning.
We are pleased to have you on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I've met you and the first time you've been with us on Doha Morning.
With the people who work hard for the program
And you, Madame Lisa.
Welcome everyone. Before we start the conversation,
Okay, let's see.
I am a managing and executing man.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Heard, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them if anyone agrees that you don't have to return the bisht.
Of course I have another question to start with, but since we've watched this part of "The Nine-Tailed Fox" Part 1.
He pointed to Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some historians relate that the famous poet Imru' al-Qais belongs to the city of Marrat.
In this country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there are many things and information.
For more information, we'll watch this excellent report from our colleague, Abdulrahman Mashhad.
We'll see it together.
Certainly, the testimony of people who know about the subject, without flattery or favoritism.
And as proof of the history of this city or that.
As much as we see of its effects and its stories from its narrators and poets.
Their classics and modern works, so this comes as an important record added to the city's annals.
Marat City is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded during the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some thought it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the gulf which is named after him.
Its founding date is unknown.
In the Age of Ignorance.
The most famous thing in the city of Marat is Mount Comet, which many legends have relied on.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical places.
This sight is considered a tourist attraction in Saudi Arabia.
Maraat Municipality has made a Herculean effort to achieve
A park above this mountain.
And councils for citizens and for all in the kingdom.
Named after the Prophet's companion Khalid bin Walid (may God be pleased with him).
Fighting the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
And among her works is the Wadi Komet.
This is a place where water from springs gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
One of her works is also the Al-Dohai Heritage House.
Marat is a city with a history dating back to pre-Islamic times.
He was famous for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Mount Komit.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed to the program Sabah Al-Doha,
Marat City, north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you'll let us know and inform the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, you mentioned that our infrastructure is a very unique one.
We open a file for him and he registers with a special file in our system.
Parent's email.
This report covers the range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard gets a full report.
Present, this report will be added to the academic record.
His son's number online.
And see the progress of his son.
And he can see his grades and interaction with teachers.
So we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this sweet girl.
So we were able to bring most of the children to the center and send them our warm regards.
Those who joined this center with the doctor there.
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached since she joined the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one job after Ramadan.
But of course this is an effect that always works at the expense of another job.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up watching TV, while people worship the television.
Simplify, simplify, simplify your processes. Let them do one job every two years. Is that better?
Certainly.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
But I would like to send you all my best regards.
God willing.
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held in Katara, the Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and loyalty.
And develop the children's abilities and skills further.
Different from various schools in this generous country.
We have a model, and we contacted our previous guest.
Now with us is Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam, we welcome him and say good morning.
How are you, Oumnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Dr. Ibrahim, to start, could you introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Amina is an example of that.
We'll try the technique or method that Professor Nesma talked about with her.
Do you sense any difference in his mindset?
You feel that these skills and techniques,
Nothing changes regarding his mental abilities or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
Incorporate a child testing phase at the beginning with an international test called the Tony Test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the student's level or the change in their level through it.
Now there will be a test or something similar.
Amany will count and respond live on air.
Of course, Amanya has no idea about the questions.
We surprised them with this.
Of course I have another question first,
We want to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the series of classifications of the first part,
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky with several roles.
Professor Ghaniem,
Distribute roles with CEO Ashraf Shahata and Mr.
This is an opportunity from Tara for artistic production.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghaniem nominated me this year for
Certainly every episode is different.
I have more than one episode in which I participate with different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this job, we...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza, we have...
You have another group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Assam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we worked on two projects per year.
Maybe that's why I asked you before going on air. You've been working since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition in acting.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I do it as a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. The person who nurtured my talent at the beginning was the artist Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me their son.
If you need anything, call him.
We were in all of his shows.
We're tired, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very, very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait, they have 12 to 16 new actors emerging every year. Why?
They have it.
Of course, I thank you very much for it because it provides many opportunities.
Okay, let's say,
Let's talk about the second series, we had an idea about Tsaneev.
We need to know about the deadly feeling.
And after the man.
We have a sample, and with us is the processor Professor Abdulaziz Al-Miyouf Al-Tamimi.
Until the procedure is on air.
And we can see how to deal with the person. First of all, let me say good morning to Professor Sabhi bin Hamza, may God bless you.
Welcome, and peace be upon you.
Let's start with you, Sir.
If God wills.
In the name of God
We hold hands.
Let's see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God, glorified be He, displaying all the members of your body.
From the inside and its problems.
You feel dizzy sometimes.
I have a headache and I feel dizzy.
Loosen your grip, loosen it. Keep your nerves relaxed, yes.
By doing that, Abu Abdulaziz, you'll see something specific in his hand that'll let you know he has a certain disease.
On his left side. His ears, he has a mild inflammation in his middle ear.
"There's pain! What does it mean, Abu Abdulaziz?"
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
Since the day I was born and since I was a baby.
Do you still have pain here?
These are the sinuses!
Do you have a pain in your nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It gives him a pain between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
It seems her thyroid glands aren't functioning properly; she feels lethargic and sluggish all the time, and her body feels heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either staying up late or being lazy, you always feel sluggish.
You always have tonsillitis.
In. See the tremor, notice the tremor.
He's stressed, and he'll never walk barefoot again, maybe the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this massage also beneficial for children?
My wife's hand, praise be to God, is the size of a child's palm.
Most of the kids aren't sleeping, why?
If you pick him up, he doesn't like it, but people think he does. He has gas in his belly, thank you.
When the mother puts her thumb, she stretches it.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the girl is parallel to them.
Let's see it, so every mother can learn this move.
You press like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This is about the boy, about, about, about the boy and how sweet he is.
Present, regarding discoveries, you have discoveries specific to women.
As we said, in every house, there are ninety percent women, God bless them.
The first thing, the first warning about ceramic and flat floors.
If we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's fine, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The evidence for this is that when ceramic was used in homes, health problems increased.
Because it's cold and also.
When he was a child, he had problems, he suffered from asthma.
Increased.
Remember to focus on walking barefoot on the sand.
This is the foot and the area behind, the annex.
Here, this is the foot and now under the hammer.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is the facilitation of the delivery method.
Focus with me a bit.
In the seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just as soon as we enter the delivery month.
I mean, they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is that they walk barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be cautious when walking barefoot.
If she had been on time.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, "And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop on you fresh dates."
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even spoke to the scholars, and they told me: Why change the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God put in these sciences, and He inspires me."
Shake the palm trunk towards you, what does it look like when you shake the palm tree?
It's sharp as nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, the wombs, which are the area of the wombs, here in the middle, are commanded.
It's the intestines. They issue orders to facilitate childbirth and to reposition the fetus.
The elevation of the fetal head or its redistribution, until it assumes a natural position.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
And he took his hands and began to relax.
Some take it as a practice, and some know it as a science.
For this reason, they are afraid to tell you, and you wouldn't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
I just wanted to ask you one last question because time flew by.
If anyone wants to get in touch with you, anyone at all, any specific email or you.
Okay, the mobile number is available in the control room. If anyone wants to communicate with Professor Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course on Qatar TV numbers, so that he can call us and take this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like everyone else, and I do everything imaginable. I'm a regular human being.
But, we're looking for the good more.
We always think of good.
Dear viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
We saw a live model on air, demonstrating how to detect diseases in a person.
And what he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from him, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read about him through the internet.
The way it will be implemented in the coming days or years and whether it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So we were afraid Qatar would become the fifth with them.
This program frankly, became the first lady of New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for this.
They presented it to us, we adopted it and said, "Perfect."
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the countries of the world, and this is what we aspire to in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He stopped playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
Kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us what he gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are at the end today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
"Al-Mostaqbal Girls' School, Ruwais"
And with high morale.
The family became more aware, and their siblings were enthusiastic at home and started eating the same food as them.
A transitional culture emerged between the student and it transfers this culture to the home and to its family.
He goes and tells them, "Give me this or teach me this."
The training staff or the one who provided this information to the students,
How did you select it and how did you communicate with the student? Who communicated?
Yes, many people helped us, may God reward them well.
We have brothers at a diet center teaching them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn dining etiquette with Professor Aisha Al-Tamimi.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or raising awareness about the value of healthy nutrition.
It was in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
How do you convey these ideas to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, where we met with all the male and female students.
This isn't about any one person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
How are these students dealt with at first!
I initially said the results were satisfactory.
Is the presence of three semesters or specific semesters sufficient in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, you don't start on a large scale.
It starts with a reasonable set that has all the attributes; boys, girls, independent, and private.
As long as it doesn't fit with our culture, environment, or family circumstances, just as they accept some things for their children and don't accept others.
They want to participate in it frankly, it's very important.
A student aged twelve or thirteen, this is the right time for him to know about his health.
This is really a torment for many people who want to lose weight, but they imagine it's impossible.
Some actors we see in the movies with thin bodies say this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through Doha's mornings, we can remind them of it.
And fruits with vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
The person needs to know the benefits of fruits and must be aware that if they eat them, their health will improve, and thus their morale will be high.
As for the fruit, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruit.
This is true, period.
It is diverse and natural for them to compete; each school was creative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We give them guidelines and everyone has to be creative.
Do the teachers teach the students, or do you have private employees?
I built them, I built them.
But teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida School said they would dedicate Saturday to student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and approve it, Rokia school says it will hold a march.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to cook healthy on their own, the girls were better at it.
I would also like to thank Reyan Water for providing free water to all schools, Reyan Water for this gesture.
Of course, water is much healthier because it needs to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
It means his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and not even know that this is the game I love.
Correct, correct, exactly, and some might want another game, maybe they don't like team games.
Hello, live with us.
Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society, welcome to our program.
"On which we certainly try to focus on important issues as much as we can."
We would like to introduce and provide our dear viewers with information about multiple sclerosis.
Because this name might also sound strange to us.
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All currently available treatments are preventive.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start to
Kills us by hitting the nerve cell.
Let me clarify it for the audience, it's just like a wire.
Covered by a layer called the lubricant, let's say it's the nylon layer.
Of course, it usually leads to dizziness and double vision, diplopia.
It also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
It can lead to madness in the worst cases, causing quadriplegia or paraplegia.
Certainly treatments.
Important functions in the body are greatly damaged.
Or from this disease, the one called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say it is transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not infectious.
Children's rights matter.
Some people consider it a regional disease.
The equator, for example, was exempt from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are still unable to find the cause of the disease, so they can find a cure for it.
Currently, the process has reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a bit scared of this issue, which we can describe as this disease coming suddenly.
Is there a specific group where this disease seems to be spreading within that particular community?
Internationally, it has been ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the international association for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started affecting young people up to the age of forty.
But humans can't recover from it.
Certainly, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the association, the Multiple Sclerosis Qatar Association.
Why do we have this society?
He was in a large group, so I thought about creating an association for this topic.
Certainly, I'll give you random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My number was sixty or forty-six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient has this disease?
We're not certain this is a virus, so we don't want to commit to a particular theory, that's one thing.
The second point is how do I know if I'm infected or not.
This is very difficult.
I am confused! Professor Abdulaziz, I am trying to get to a specific point.
