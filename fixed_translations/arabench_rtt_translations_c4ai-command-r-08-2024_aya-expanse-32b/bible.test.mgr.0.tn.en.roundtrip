environmental khoa who is the most important person in the kingdom?
khoa pupils came to him at that time and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoae soul shall be free from pride like this child, is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
"Would anyone deceive one of these little ones who believe in me and lead them into sin? If anyone does this, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea."
khoa knows who will put the world in order because of the things that drive people to sin! These things must happen. But who will deal with those who cause them!
"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. There you will remain forever in the Fire."
If your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Gehenna. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't mock any of these children. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can at any time go to the Lord in heaven.
(No
"What do you think? A man has 100 sheep, and one of them is lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep in the mountain and go look for the lost sheep?"
"Truly I tell you, there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need repentance."
That's why your Father in Heaven is like you. He doesn't want to lose even one of the little ones. When anyone sins against you
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him why he is wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won.
"But what if someone doesn't listen to you? Take one or two others with you, for every word must be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to witnesses? In that case, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? In that case, do not treat him as a brother. Treat him as you would treat someone without religion or a tax collector.
"What I'm going to tell you is true. What is closed on earth is closed in heaven. And what is opened on earth is opened in heaven."
"Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven."
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." - Matthew 18:20 (NIV)
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered and said, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who collects all the money his subjects have given him.
The king started doing it, so he brought in a man who owed him billions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay. His master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all he owned had to be sold to repay his debt.
"The servant fell to his knees before him. 'Give me time,' he pleaded. 'We'll pay you back everything.'"
"He felt pity for him. He forgave him and let him go."
"But after the servant left, he met one of the men who had given him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started choking him, saying, 'Give me back the money you gave me!'"
The other servant fell to his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'We'll pay you back.'
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
They saw what happened to the other servants. It confused them a lot. They went and told their master everything that happened.
Then the lord called the first servant. "Wicked servant," he said. "I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me."
Where is your mercy for the other servant as you have shown mercy to me?
In anger, his companion handed him over to the jailer. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
This is how your heavenly Father will treat you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
**Jesus Teaches on Divorce**
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Then some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. And it is not possible to separate the man whom God has joined.
They said: "And why did Moses say that a man should write a divorce document for his wife and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you. A man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man divorces his wife only if she is not faithful to him.
The students said, "If this is how it is between a husband and his wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those whom God helps can live without marriage."
"Some men cannot have a family because they were born that way. Others are made that way by other people. But others have chosen to be that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this way of living should do so." The little children came to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to go away.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For to such belongs the kingdom of God."
He laid his hands on them. Then he went on his way. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, follow the commandments."
"What?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
He said: "I have kept all these commandments. What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered: "If you wish to be perfect, go and sell all you have, give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the boy heard these words, he walked away sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter said, "We've tried everything and nothing works! Who will come to our aid?"
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When all things are renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
The Tale of the Workers in the Vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw people standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You too, go and serve me in my vineyards. I will give you what is right."
They walked. He went out again at midday, at three o'clock, and did the same thing.
At around five o'clock, he went out and found another group standing. He asked them, "Why are you sitting like this all day long and doing nothing?"
" 'No one has brought us any,' they said. He asked them, 'Then why don't you go and work in my vineyard?'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the foreman who was in charge of the workers. He said to him, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Start with those who were hired last, and then go to those who were hired first."
The workers who were hired arrived around five o'clock. Each of them received their regular daily wage.
When the newly hired employees arrived, they expected to be paid more. However, each of them received the regular daily wage.
When they arrived, they started complaining about their friend.
They said: 'These people you brought in only worked for an hour, and you paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and stayed under the sun all day.'
The employer answered one of them. He said, "My friend, I'm treating you fairly. Didn't we agree that you would work for the regular daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I'd like to give the same amount to the people who come after you.
Why can't I do what I love with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I generously gave to others?
"Those who were last will be first, and those who were first will be last." Jesus again reminds of His coming death.
Jesus was walking on the way to Jerusalem. On the road, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"And then they will hand him over to the people who are not Jewish. They will mock him and beat him with whips, and they will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
She came with her children. She knelt down and made a request to him.
"Who do you want me to give it to?" Jesus asked. She said to him, "He promised me that one of my sons would sit at your right hand in your kingdom. He promised me that the other would sit at your left."
They said to Jesus, "Do you know what you are asking? Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard this story. They were jealous of the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them and said to them, "You know the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Don't think that way. On the contrary, whoever wants to be important among you should be your servant.
And whoever desires to be first among you must be your slave.
"Be like Adam's son. He did not come to serve himself, but to serve others. He came to sacrifice himself for the freedom of many people."
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd was following him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowds ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the dragon man shouted louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
They said to him, "Sir, we want to see."
Jesus felt a deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He told them, "Go to the place in front of you. When you arrive, you will find a donkey tied up. Her foal will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them God needs them. The employer will send them right away.
This happened so that what is spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you; He is humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
Disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
Large crowds spread their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
**English:** "Wherever Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. People asked, 'Who is this?'"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple. He began to drive out those who were selling and buying in it. He overturned the money changers' tables. And he overturned the chairs of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a 'den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
People brought blind and disabled people to Jesus in the temple. He healed them there.
The chief priests and the elders saw the miracles he did, and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" When they saw all this, they were indignant.
"What do you hear the children saying?" they asked him. "Yes," Jesus replied, "have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city, and went to Bethany. He lodged there that night. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree near the road. He walked to it, but found only leaves. After saying to it, "You will not bear fruit from this day forward!" suddenly the tree withered.
When the students saw this sight, they were amazed. "How did the wound heal so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
"If you believe, my Lord will answer you according to your request and when you pray." "Doubting Jesus' authority"
Jesus entered the temple and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said, "I also will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone will believe that John was a prophet.
They answered him, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "If I do not tell you the reason, you will not understand. The story of the two sons."
"Who do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first son and said, 'My son, go today to work in the vineyard.'"
He said, "I'm not going to do it," but after thinking for a moment, he changed his mind and went ahead.
Then the father went to the second son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "Yes, sir." But he didn't go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw it with your own eyes. Yet you did not turn from your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
"Hear another story. A man had a piece of land where he planted vineyards. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it. And he built a watchtower. He leased it to some farmers. Then he went on a journey."
**English:** When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the farmers. He told them to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
The man sent other people to rent. He sent more than the first time. The landlord treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent them his son. He said, "Maybe they'll respect my son."
But the laborers saw the boy coming. They said to each other, 'This is the one who will one day take all his master's possessions. Come, let's kill him, and everything will be ours.'
That's how they brought him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
"When the landlord returns, what will he do with those tenants?"
"These wicked men," they answered, "shall be destroyed; then shall he assign him his share of the vineyard; and they shall deliver his harvest to him at the proper time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Quran, 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22, 23)
"This is what I will tell you. May God take the kingdom from you and give it to others who will make it flourish."
Anyone who falls on that stone will be crushed. The stone breaks anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew He was speaking about them.
So they plotted how to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. People were sure that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them many stories. He said,
This is the picture of the heavenly kingdom. The king made a great feast for his son.
She sent her servant to those who were invited to dinner. They told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent two more men. He told them, "Go and say to those whom I invited, 'I have prepared the dinner. I have slaughtered my fatted calves and my fat cows. Everything is ready. Come to the dinner.'"
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another went to his business.
Those who remained were captured as slaves. They were treated violently and then killed.
The pasha became very angry. He sent the army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the corners. Invite anyone you meet to dinner.
The servants went out into the streets. They gathered everyone they found, both good and bad. And soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He found one who was not wearing wedding clothes.
His friend said to him, "How did you come in here without your wedding clothes?" The man had nothing to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Does Caesar have the right to levy taxes?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are an honest man. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't care about anyone's opinion, nor do you show favoritism. You teach the way of God honestly. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?"
Tell me, what do you think? Should we pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
I want to see the money that people pay in taxes. He brought him a silver coin.
I said to them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's," they said. Then he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. "For the dead to rise"
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe in the resurrection after death.
"Professor, this is what Moses said. If a man dies without a child, his brother must marry the widow. He must father a child to carry his brother's name."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he didn't have any children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same story happened with the second and third brothers. Now it's the turn of the nephew.
In the end, the woman died.
And why, when the resurrection comes, with whom will you be? All seven of them are married to you.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong; you do not know the Quran. And you do not know the power of my Lord."
**Tunisian** When they raise the dead, they don't get married. And their parents don't give them away in marriage. They become like angels in paradise.
"Who are these dead people who are rising? Have you not read what the Lord has said?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the audience heard these words, they were amazed at what he was teaching. The most important recommendation.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they met together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Professor, what is the most important commandment of the law?" he asked.
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." "Where is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"Who do you think the Messiah is? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "What does David say whom the Lord called? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.' " (Psalm 110:1)
"If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be David's son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
**Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law**
Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:
"They sit on Moses' seat," he said.
You have to obey them. Do everything they ask you to do. But don't do as they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They carry heavy burdens and place them on others' shoulders. But they don't want to lift a finger to change them.
All they do is to be seen by people. They wear small amulets on their foreheads and under their clothes, containing verses from the Quran. They enlarge the amulets greatly and lengthen the hair on the cuffs of their garments.
They like to sit in the place of honor at banquets. They like to have the best seat in the temples.
They like to be greeted in the markets. They like people to call them "Rabbi."
"But you cannot be called 'Lord'. You have one Master and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth "Father," for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher.' You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important one among you is his brother.
He who raises himself falls, and he who falls is raised up.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
"How evil you are, you blind fools! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is not binding; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.'"
You're blind and foolish! What's more important, gold or the temple that worships gold?
Many people say, "If someone swears by the stove, it doesn't count, but if they swear by what's inside it, they must keep their promise."
O blind ones! Which is more important: the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
"Anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and everything in it."
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by His name and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former."
Oh you blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will be clean as well.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. "
That's your problem. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing, but inside, you're full of mistakes. You deceive yourself and appear to be something you're not.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous."
And they say: 'If we had been living in the days of those who went before us, we would not have been partners in the killing of the prophets.'
You bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Complete the sins that those before you have started!
"O den of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to the fire?"
It is I who sent you the prophets, the wise men, and the teachers. You were able to kill some of them, crucify others, and whip others in their temples. You pursued them from place to place.
"So that you might finish off all the righteous blood you've shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah. Zechariah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
I'll tell you what's true. All this is going to happen to those who live like this.
"O Jerusalem! O Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is empty.
I tell you, do not keep looking at me until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
**Signs of the Apocalypse**
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "The truth I tell you is this. Not one stone will be left standing here; every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There, his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jobu Jesus: "Beware! Be careful lest anyone deceive you."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many people.
"You hear about wars. And you hear people talking about future wars. Don't think too much. This has to happen. But the day is not here yet."
Countries are at war with countries. Kingdoms are at war with kingdoms. People are starving. Earthquakes are spreading in many areas.
All this is the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
"And then they will hand you over, torture you, and kill you. And all the nations will hate you because of me."
In their ignorance, they stray from their faith. They come to hate each other. They deliver themselves into the hands of their enemies.
Many people will seem to be liars to you. And they laugh at many people.
Because of the abundance of evil, the love of most people will grow cold.
But those who persist until the last moment can succeed.
This good news from the kingdom is proclaimed throughout the universe. It bears witness to all nations. And then comes the end.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of 'the abomination that desolates.' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this."
Those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one needs to go up on the roof and down to their house to get something.
No one in the field go back to get his jacket.
Who will take care of the pregnant women in those days! Who will take care of the nursing mothers!
Pray that you don't find yourself having to flee in winter or on a Saturday.
In those days there will be tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever will be again.
If it weren't for God shortening time, no one would live. But thanks to God's chosen people, He does shorten it.
No one will say to you at that time, "Look! There is the Christ!" or "Here he is!" Do not believe it.
Imposters and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's far out in the desert," don't go. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
"The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west. That's how the story goes when a son of man comes."
Vultures gather wherever there is a dead body.
"In those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
"At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory."
Ismito is a small town surrounded by mountains from all sides. It is located in a valley, with hills and peaks towering over it from every direction. One can see the sky only in patches between the peaks.
"I learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its veins begin to soften and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near."
However you see all these things happening, you know for certain that the end is near. It's at the door.
I'll only tell you the truth. People who lived in that period didn't die until everything I said happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
I haven't told anyone about the day or the hour. Even the angels in heaven don't know. The son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They had no idea what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two masters in the field, one they take and the other they leave.
Two women are grinding at the mill with their hands. One takes and one stays.
**Stay alert. You never know why the month of Ramadan will come.**
You need to understand something. If the homeowner knew what time at night the thief was coming, he would have been prepared. He wouldn't have allowed anyone to steal from his home.
You need to be ready. The Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.
"A master appoints one of his slaves over the rest of the slaves in his house. The task of this slave is to provide them with food on time. The master seeks a trustworthy and vigilant slave for this service."
It is in the slave's interest to find a master to serve and to serve in his absence.
What I'm about to tell you is true. His master is going to make that slave responsible for everything he owns.
"But suppose this servant is wicked. Suppose he says in his heart, 'My master is delayed.'
If he starts beating people. And if he starts eating and drinking with those who drink excessively.
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect it. He will come at an hour he does not know.
Then the maestro began to cut them up until they became pieces. He sent them to the place where the claimants go. There they cried and bit their teeth.
The Tale of the Ten Brides
This is a picture from the parable of the Kingdom of Heaven at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The foolish ones brought their lamps, but they did not bring olive oil with them.
The wise men brought oil in flasks with their lamps.
The groom hasn't come yet. That's why all the girls got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted: 'Here comes the groom! Go out to meet him!'
"Then they surpassed all the certificates and prepared their lamps."
The ignorant said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No, he doesn't need to get everything. When you go to the oil sellers, buy some for yourself."
"That's how they went to buy oil. But by the time they were on their way, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready for the wedding entered with him. Then they closed the door."
After a while, the bride's older sisters arrived. "Oh sir! Oh sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "The story I'm going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
**Stay vigilant. You don't know the day or the hour when the groom will come. The story of the three servants.**
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who went on a journey. He called his servants and put them in charge of his property."
He gave one million dinars. He gave another four hundred dinars. And he gave the third one hundred dinars. The man gave each servant according to his ability. And he went on his way.
The servant who received ten thousand dinars immediately started investing his money. He made an additional ten thousand dinars.
He who brought $4,000 added another $4,000.
But the man who was given 2000 dinars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man to whom I had given 10,000 dinars brought another 10,000 dinars. He said, "Sir, you trusted me and gave me 10,000 dinars. Look, I made another 10,000 dinars."
"His master answered him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!'"
"The man who had 4000 is coming too. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me and gave me 4000. Look, I made an extra 4000.'
"His master answered, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!'"
Then came the man to whom he gave 2000 dinars. He said to him, "Sir, I know you are a tough man. You plant where you haven't cultivated and reap where you haven't sown."
I was scared. I went out and buried the $2000 for you. Look, this is what belongs to you.
Jawablou Sayidu: "You foolish and lazy one! Do you know that I reap in a place where I did not sow? Do you know that I gather crops from a place where I did not scatter seed?"
And why didn't I put my money in the bank? When I come back, I'll find it with interest.
Then his master ordered the other servants, "Take the 2000 away from him and give it to the one who has 20000."
Anyone who has more will have it increased for them, so that they will have more than enough. But those who do not have will have even what they have taken from them.
"Put that worthless slave outside. There, in the dark, people are crying and gnashing their teeth." "Sheep and billy goat."
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne."
All the nations will be gathered before him. People will be separated into two groups, like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the camels on his left.
Then the king speaks to those on his right and says to them, 'Blessed are you by my father. Come, take what is yours. This is the king who has been preparing for you since the creation of the world.'
I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
You clothed me when I was in need, and you gave me shelter. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?"
Why did we see you as a stranger and bring you in? Why did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
"Why didn't we see you sick or in jail so we could help you?"
The king replied, "The story I am about to tell you is true. Whatever you do to one of these little brothers of mine, you do to me."
"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
"They will say, 'O Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not help You?'
He replies to you, saying: "The story I'm about to tell you is true. Anything I haven't done to one of these children, I haven't done to you."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.
**The Plan to Kill Jesus**
Jesus said all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be crucified and die.
The elders met with the chief priests of the people. They gathered in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They planned to catch him in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"But not on the festival," they said. "There might be a riot." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, a leper, in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, broke it open, and poured the perfume over his head while he was eating.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why is this happening?" they said.
"The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to poor people."
Jesus knew this, and he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
You always have poverty with you. But I don't always have it.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
"What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will be published everywhere this joyful news is spoken of throughout the world. So that you will always be remembered." "John agrees to hand over Jesus."
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you?" They weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him.
From that time on, Jesus was waiting for the right moment to hand himself over to them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
Reply: "Go to the countryside to a certain man. Tell him: 'The teacher said: 'My time is near. I will celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples.' "
The disciples did as Jesus had directed them. They prepared the Passover meal.
**English:** When evening came, Jesus was on the platform with the musicians.
As they were eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
He told them the story. Many of them began to say, "Not me, Lord, not me."
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand in the dish with me will betray me."
"A son of Adam walks as destined. But what is the state of the one who betrays the son of Adam? It would have been better if he had never been born."
Judas was the one who would betray him. He said, "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he raised the cup. He praised God and passed it to them, saying, "Drink from it all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, shed for the forgiveness of sins for all.
This is what I told you. That's why I won't drink wine with you until the day I drink with you in the kingdom of our father.
**Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "Today, you will deny me."**
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7)."
But after we rise from the dead, we will precede you into the Galilean.
Replied Peter, "Everyone might leave you. But I'll never leave."
"What I'm telling you is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "Even if all perish, I will not deny you." The same did all the other disciples say. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Carrying Peter, James, and John with him, Jesus began to feel sad and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell on his face to the ground. He prayed and said, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet, not my will but yours be done."
Then he went back to his friends and found them sleeping. "Can't you even wait with me for just one hour?" he said to them.
"Watch and pray. Otherwise, you will fall into sin when temptation comes, for the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus walked again. He prayed, "Papa, is it possible for this cup to be taken from me? But if it is necessary for me to drink it, let it be as you desire."
He came back later. He found them searching. They couldn't stay awake.
He left them and walked away again. He prayed the same prayer for the third time.
Then he returned to his disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of sinners."
Come on! Let's go! There he is, waving to them! They're calling Isa.
When Jesus was speaking, Judas arrived. It was around the twelfth hour. He had a large crowd with him. They were carrying clubs and torches. The chief priests and the elders had sent them.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, signaled to them. "This is the one I'm talking about," he said. "Seize him."
Judas went up to Jesus quickly, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized him and arrested him.
At that time, one of Jesus' companions reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Tell him: "Put your sword in its place; everyone who takes the sword will die by the sword."
Don't you think we can't ask God for help? He will send me an army of angels, more than 70,000, in an instant.
"But how are the sacred texts verified? They say it must happen like that."
Then Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like a bandit?" He added, "Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this is your hour, when darkness reigns."
But all this happened so that the prophet's words might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was tried before the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus brought him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He came to the inner courtyard of the high priest. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for some way to bring about Jesus' death.
But they found no proof, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two more witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This one said, 'We will destroy God's temple, and in three days we will rebuild it.' "
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these people are accusing you of?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Ah. That is true, as I said," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all, in the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see him coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy against the Lord! Why do we need other witnesses? You heard the blasphemy yourselves."
"What's your opinion?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they imprisoned him. They hit him with their fists. And they continued to kick him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said that he wasn't. "We don't know why you're talking."
Then he went out to the gate that led to the courtyard. Another woman saw him there. She told the people, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said it again and swore, "I don't know the man!"
After a while, those who had been standing there approached Peter. "You are one of them," they said. "Your accent gives you away."
And then, Peter began to curse and swear. He swore to them, "I do not know the man!" At that moment, the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered Jesus' words. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had said to him. "Before it does, you will disown me three times." Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was still dark. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They tied him up and brought him. After they handed him over to the palace, where the governor was.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt ashamed and deeply regretted what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said: "I committed a sin, I greeted a man who was not supposed to be greeted." They said: "What does it concern us? That's your problem."
Suddenly, Judas threw the money into the temple and went out. After he had left, he hanged himself.
The senior leaders brought the money. They said, "This is ill-gotten gain and should not be used in the temple's treasury. This is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy land for burial. People from outside would be buried there.
That's why they still call it the Field of Blood.
Then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said, "They took the thirty pieces of silver. This is the price set by the sons of Israel."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus before Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the adults and elders came to accuse him, he didn't answer them.
Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the accusation they are making against you?"
But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that this was the reason they had handed Jesus over to him.
While he was sitting on the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message: "Don't interfere with that man. He is innocent. I dreamed about him today and suffered greatly because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which of the two should I release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done to deserve this?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and with a sudden flare-up of anger he went back into the palace. "What! You bring me this man as one who stirs up the people," he said, "and look, I have examined him in your
Everyone replied: "We and our children bear the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers brought Jesus to the governor's headquarters, called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. And they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They watch him. They hit him on the head with a stick once and then again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They gave him back his clothes. Then they took him and led him to the cross. They crucified Jesus on the cross.
As they were leaving the place, they met a man from Cyrene, whose name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They went to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with bitterness and gave it to him to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They came, sat, and guarded him there.
They placed a sign above his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
The thief escaped with him. One on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
And they said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
However the priests, jurists, and elders understood it, they ridiculed it.
They said, "He saves others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.
"He trusts in God. God will save him this very hour, if He wills it. He who said, 'I am the Son of God'."
The thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus died.
From where until when three, darkness covered the whole land.
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately, one of them ran and brought a sponge. He put vinegar in it and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elias comes to his aid."
After Jesus cried out with a loud voice, he died.
While they were seated, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The graves were opened. And many of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The centurion and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified and said, "Surely this was the Son of God!"
Going on a little further, he saw many women who were following and mourning him. They had come from Galilee and had been his followers, serving him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there as well. So was the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
When evening came, a man named Joseph, who was from Arimathea, arrived. He was a good and righteous man, and he had not consented to their decision and action. He was a follower of Jesus.
Peter went to Jesus and asked for his body. Peter commanded them to stop.
Joseph laid the body down and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And they laid it in the new tomb they had cut in the rock. They rolled a big stone across the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said: "My lord, we remember what that liar said while he was still alive. He said: 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' That last deception would be worse than the first.
"Tell them to take guards with them," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
**English:** The day of the week had moved on to Saturday. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His body shines like lightning. His clothes are white as snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they trembled and fled like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He's not here! He got up, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Walk quickly! Tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him." Behold, I have told you.
They ran quickly from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Peace!" he said. They went to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the elders met with the seniors, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a lot of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That way, we'll keep you out of trouble.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated before him. However, some of them still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
You must go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am with you always, to the end.
"John the Baptist prepares the way."
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths.'"
And so John came. He baptized people in the wilderness. He taught them a great deal and told them they must be baptized and turn away from their sins. And so God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went to him. Even people from Jerusalem went. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore camel wool clothes. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
"Someone stronger than I will come after me. I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opening, and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven: "You are my son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
Suddenly, the Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. Then the devil came to him and tempted him. The wild beasts did him no harm. Angels waited on him and took care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
And after they had put John in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
"The hour has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Suddenly they left their windows and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. At that time, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in their boat, mending their nets.
Quickly, they called him. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired hands. Afterward, they followed him. Jesus healed a demon-possessed man.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When it was the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were surprised by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He didn't speak as the religious teachers do.
Suddenly, a man cried out in their temple. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
"Who are you to deal with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One from God!"
"Be quiet!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
We were all amazed. We even asked each other, "Who is he? What is this? A new teaching! And with great authority! Even the evil spirits obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the mosque. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he walked to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had passed. After that, she started serving them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick or possessed by demons.
Gather all the people in the square in front of the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. And he cast out many demons. But he would not let them speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still dark in the early morning. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they said, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus said, "Let us go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. We need to preach there as well. That is why I have come."
He traveled throughout all the region of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to him, knelt down before him, and begged him earnestly. He said, "If you want to heal me and cleanse me, you can do it."
Jesus was very confused. He reached out and touched the man. "I'm ready to do it," he said. "Be 'healed'!"
Now the disease has increased. Get well.
They sent Jesus away immediately. They warned the man sternly.
He said, "Do not speak this word to anyone. Go, present yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to tell it everywhere, spreading the news to everyone. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in solitary places, but people still came to him
**Jesus Heals a Man Unable to Walk**
A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered, so large that there was no more room for them, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get to him because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man down on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia scholars were sitting there. They were thinking,
"Why does this person speak like this? They utter demonic words! Only God forgives sins!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why do you think this way?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"We want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
He said, "Get up, take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and took his mat. He walked, and everyone marveled. They were astonished, praised God, and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chose Levi.
Once again Jesus walked along the shore of Lake Galilee. A large crowd followed him and listened as he taught them.
As he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Then Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. There was a large group of tax collectors and "sinners" eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the larger group that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."
The scribes and the Pharisees were hypocrites. They taught one thing but did another. Jesus said to them, "You title yourselves 'teachers of the law.' But why do you break the law?
Jesus answered and said, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't sew a new patch of fabric onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old one. That way, the tear will only get bigger.

Jesus was walking with his disciples on the Sabbath through the wheat fields, and they began to pluck the ears of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! This is against the law on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do such a thing?"
Reply: "Didn't you read about what David did? He and his friends were hungry. They needed food."
There was a time when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. And David gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"That's why the son of man is lord even on the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Once again Jesus went into the synagogue. There was a man there with a withered hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered and twisted hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said to him.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around in anger and was deeply distressed at their stubbornness. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, seeking to kill him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the sea from Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. Large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus said to his disciples, "Prepare a small boat for me." That way, we won't prevent people from coming to him.
Jesus was healing many people. So the sick were pushing each other to touch him.
When the people who had evil spirits in them saw him, they fell down before him. And the spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve disciples.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called to some people to come to him, and they came.
He chose twelve of them and named them Apostles. From then on, they were with him. And he sent them out to preach.
They have the authority to cast out demons.
Jesus chose twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus named him Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus named them Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
There were also many other people, like Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. And Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He is the one who will hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. The crowd gathered again. They were so numerous that Jesus and His disciples could not eat.
His family heard the news. They went to take care of him. They said, "He's crazy."
There were some teachers of the law. They had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is under the power of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus sat with them and told them stories. He said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights its own soul, it cannot stop.
If a family is divided, you can't stop it.
