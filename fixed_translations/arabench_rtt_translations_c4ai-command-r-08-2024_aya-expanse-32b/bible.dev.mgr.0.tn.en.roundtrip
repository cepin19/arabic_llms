첩 Jesus' family lineage
첵sily, this is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Shimon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz, and Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed, and Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of King David, and David was the father of Solomon, and the mother of Solomon was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram. Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
After that, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerah was the father of Ethni, Ethni was the father of Elioenai, Elioenai was the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the father of Azariah.
Ezer was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaas. Achimaas was the father of Eliam.
Eliezer was the father of Matthias. Matthias was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her in front of people. So, he decided to divorce her secretly without anyone noticing.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
Hello, I'm present to help you. You call him Isa. That's why he is successful in many of his endeavors.
All this happened so that what Allah said would come true. He said it through the Prophet.
"The virgin shall give birth. She shall give birth to a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel."
Joseph awoke. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
But she did not do so even after she gave birth to her son. And she called his name Jesus Joseph.
**The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus**
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Herod summoned the chief priests of the people and the scribes, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem of Judah," they said. "This is what the prophet wrote." He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. Therefore, he will
Herod sent the wise men on their way. He learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
I sent them to Bethlehem. He told them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, let me know. Then I will go and worship him myself."
And after they heard the king's wise men, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them. And at last it stood over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their hearts were filled with joy.
The men of wisdom came to the house. When they saw the child with his mother Mary, they prostrated before him. Afterwards, they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Do not go back to Herod." So they returned to their home country by another route. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
**English:** When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream in which an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up," the angel said to him. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph sat down. At night, he walked to Egypt with the child and Mary's mother.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had played him. He was furious. He gave orders to Bethlehem and the surrounding areas: all boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
Thus the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But after he heard that Archelaus was king over Judea, Archelaus who ruled in place of his father Herod, Joseph was afraid to go there. Joseph was warned in a dream and returned to the land of Galilee instead.
These people lived in a place called Nazareth. Thus, the prophecy about Jesus was fulfilled. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
"John the Baptist prepares the way."
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Stay away from sins! Paradise is near."
"A voice of one calling: 'In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
Clayton John was walking on the beach when he saw a starfish. He picked it up and felt its rough texture. He said it was cool and sticky.
People came from Jerusalem and all the regions of Judah. They came even from all the districts around the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! What has led you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
"You people do not understand what we are saying: 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can create children for Abraham from these very stones."
The axe is still laid at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"We will call him by the name of Emmanuel, and he will be called to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
In his hand, he holds a sickle to clean the yard of straw. He gathers the wheat in the barn. But he burns the chaff with a fire that never goes out.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop them. He said to Lacey, "I need your permission. Why did you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "It must be this way. We must do it this way. This is the fulfillment of God's sacred plan." John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
**Jesus is tempted**
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights without food, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' And 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate before me and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came to him and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was just thrown into prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Surely, the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled. He had said:
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land on the Mediterranean coast! Region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. Those who live in a dark land, the light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Suddenly they left their windows and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. And Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and abandoned their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought him all kinds of sick people, suffering from various diseases. Some were in great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing violently. Others could not move. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. People came from Galilee, from the region called the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the other side of the Jordan.
Jesus gives the blessing.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
"Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven is theirs."
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
The blessed are those who show mercy. Mercy will also be shown to them.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who make things work. They become known as God's children.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Congratulations to you for the times they laugh at you and hurt you because of me. And congratulations to you for the times they talk about you with all kinds of lies and evil rumors because of me."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in Paradise is great. Many people in the past have hurt the prophets. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But what if salt loses its saltiness? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people."
"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden."
How do they light a lamp and put it under a bowl? They light it and put it in its place. That way, the whole house is lit.
"However, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives the whole meaning to the law."
"I did not come to abolish what is written in the law or the prophets. I did not come to do away with them. On the contrary, I came to fulfill what is written."
I'll tell you the truth. Heaven and earth will pass before a small letter of the law passes. Not even a dot from the pen will pass from the law until everything is completed.
"Do not break even the least of these commandments, and do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, obey and teach these commandments, and you will be great in the kingdom of heaven."
"Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven."
"You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not murder. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever murders shall be accountable to God.'"
But this is what I want to tell you. Don't take it personally from your brother. He who takes it personally from his brother is liable to judgment. Again, he who says to his brother, "Raka," is liable to trial in the Sanhedrin. But he who says, "You fool!" is liable to the fires of hell.
"You imagine yourself now, presenting your offering on the altar. And you think that your brother has something in common with you."
Leave your gift by the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother, and then come back and present your gift.
"Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Try to settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still with him on the way. If you don't, he might take you to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the police. And you might end up in jail."
What I'm about to tell you is true. Don't leave until you pay the last penny! Adultery.
"I heard him say, 'Do not commit adultery' (Exodus 20:14)"
But this is what I want to tell you. Don't look at a woman mistakenly. Whoever does that commits adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is not worth more than your whole body. It is better for you to lose one eye than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is but one part of your body. Better to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Amen."
"It is written, 'When a man puts away his wife, he shall give her a bill of divorcement.' (Deuteronomy 24:1)"
But this is what I want to tell you: A man who divorces his wife makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man does not divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him. I swear.
Once again, you have heard how your ancestors were told long ago. They were told, "Do not break the promises you make to the Lord. Keep the vows you have made before him."
But this is what I'm telling you. Don't make such promises in the first place. Don't make promises in the name of heaven. That's my Lord's throne.
Don't let them take it in the name of the land. That's my birthright, God's gift. Don't let them take it in the name of Jerusalem. That's the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head. You can't whiten or blacken a single hair.
"Let your yes be yes and your no be no. Nothing is more evil than the devil. Be good to people."
"You have heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)"
But that's what I'm telling you. Don't fight with an evil person. "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him."
If someone takes you to court to take your shirt, give him your jacket too.
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn your back on him who asks to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
"You have heard it said, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy."
But this is what I want to tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
"Then you will be children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous."
"If you love those who love you, what reward do you expect? Even tax collectors do the same."
If you only greet your group, what's the difference from others? Even people without religion do that.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to people in need.
**Be careful and don't do 'good deeds' in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. If you do that, God in heaven will not reward you.**
"When you give to the needy, do not blow a trumpet. Do not be like those who act holy. They proclaim their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets. They love to be honored by people. What I am telling you is true. They have received their reward in full."
"When you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then He gives you what you keep hidden. Your Lord knows well what you do in secret. Prayer.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that people may see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
"When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
When you pray, don't talk too much like those who have no religion. They think they are heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be silly. Your father knows what you need before you even ask him.
This is how you pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, so that we may forgive those who sin against us.
Keep us safe from falling into sin and being led astray. Save us from the devil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you forgive, the Lord in heaven will forgive you.
If you do not forgive the sins of people, God will not forgive your sins. Fasting.
"To walk around without eating, they don't appear gloomy like those who pretend to be holy. Their faces look very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They receive their full reward."
But if you must walk without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then no one will know that you are fasting. Only your father, who is unseen, will know. He will reward you. Your father sees what is done in secret. Hide your wealth in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up your treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart is where your wealth is.
"The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light."
But imagine if your eyes couldn't see. Then your whole body would be filled with darkness. And if the light within you is darkness, how dense that darkness would be!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will either hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not even think about it.
I'll tell you, don't think. Don't think about yourself and why you eat and why you drink. And don't think about your body and why you wear clothes. Isn't life bigger than food? Aren't there things more important for the body than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you care about clothing? Look how wild flowers grow. They don't work and they don't make clothes.
But that's what we're telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
"If this is how God dresses the wild grass, what makes you think he won't clothe you even better? Grass is here today and tomorrow it will be burned. Your faith is very weak!"
Don't worry about me. Don't say "Who will we eat with?" or "Who will we drink with?" or "Who will we wear?"
Those without faith chase after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't think about tomorrow. Tomorrow will think about itself. Each day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge people.
Do not judge people. That's how you won't be judged.
You reap what you sow. You measure what you give.
You see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but you do not see the log in your own eye.
They said, "Let's get some of your eye dust out," and who would be cleaning your eye while you have a stick in it?
"You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door opens for he who knocks.
Imagine if your child asked for bread. What would you give him, a stone?
He doesn't even think about asking for a fish. Who among you would give him a live one?
Although you are evil, you know how to give your children nice gifts. Who is greater than our Lord in heaven to give nice gifts to those who ask Him!
"In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great and first commandment."
Enter into the kingdom of my Lord through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk on that road.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. The tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you like sheep, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
You can tell what they are by their fruits. "Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistle bushes?"
Nevertheless, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Not every tree bears good fruit, it's burned. It's put in the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Then we tell them clearly, "We don't know you. Stay away from me, you who do evil!" The wise builder and the foolish builder.
"Therefore, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The sun sets. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes your face. But it doesn't move. It's built on stone.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The sun has set. The water is cold. The wind blows and hits the house. And it makes a sound like your voice calling out loud.
Jesus said all these things to them. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as if he had authority. He didn't talk the way their teachers talked.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to heal me and make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of a Roman officer.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion met him. The centurion asked Jesus for help.
He said, "My lord, your servant is still in the house and cannot move. He is in great distress."
My Lord Jesus said, "Let us go and heal him."
The captain said, "Sir, I am not worthy for you to enter my house. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I am a man of authority. I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell one, "Go," and he goes. I tell another, "Come," and he comes. I tell my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who were following him, "Truly I tell you, no one in Israel has faith as great as this."
"I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
But those who think they belong to the kingdom, they are thrown out into the darkness. There they weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman commander, "Go! As you have believed, so it will be done to you." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Simon's house, he saw Simon's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus took her by the hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
This is how the words of the prophet Isaiah were fulfilled: "He carried our sufferings and bore our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) There is a price to follow Jesus.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him and told his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a lawyer came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered and said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
Another follower said to him, "Sir, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves beat against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The disciples came to him and woke him up. They said, "Master! Save us! We are about to drown!"
"Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the wind and the waves to stop, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. They said, "Who is this man? Even the wind and the waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus reached the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He encountered two men possessed by demons. They came out of the tombs. These men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"God, what do You want from us?" they cried. "Have You come to punish us before our time of judgment?"
I walked quite far, and there was a large herd of pigs eating.
**The demons begged Jesus:** "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who had been tending the swine fled. They went into the town and told everything, including what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their region.
**Jesus Heals a Man Unable to Walk**
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his destination.
Then Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the grammarians said to themselves: "This man is saying something very strange!"
He knew what they were thinking. He told them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk"?
"We want you to know that a child of man has the power to forgive sins on earth." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. He said to him, "Rise, take up your mat, and go to your home."
The man stood up and walked to his house.
When the audience saw this sight, they were amazed and astonished. They praised God for the gift He had given to humanity. Jesus chose Matthew.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the house of Matthew. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Walk and understand what is meant by "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to follow me." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to him and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered: "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't sew a new patch of fabric onto old clothes. The new patch stands out from the old one. That way, the tear becomes more noticeable.
"People don't pour new wine into old skins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will run out, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new skins. That way, they save both."
And while he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler's house, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?" As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he said to the ruler
Jesus got up and went with them. His disciples went with them too.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been sick and was bleeding for twelve years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
I thought, "What we needed was to touch his clothes. That's how we'd be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the official's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the crowd wailing.
He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
When they had crossed to the other side, Jesus took the girl by the hand and she got up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
They started to see each other again. Isa warned them sternly, "Make sure no one finds out about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
Just then, they brought to Jesus a man who was possessed by a demon that made him unable to speak.
When the devil left, the man spoke. The audience was amazed. They said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the scribes said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons." It's just a few workers.
Jesus went throughout every city and village. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the kingdom to them. And He healed every sick and afflicted person.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the master of the harvest to send people to work in his field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out demons and to heal every disease and illness.
Hani brought you the names of the twelve disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After that come Philip and Bartholomew, followed by Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The others were James and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go to any Gentile territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town.
Go to the children of Israel, who are like lost sheep.
Wherever you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not take with you in the belt any gold or silver or copper.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. The worker will be provided with what he needs.
"To enter a place or village, look for someone happy to host you. Stay in their home until you leave."
When you enter the house, greet the people living there.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. But if it doesn't welcome you, don't bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to you. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their house or that place.
I'll only tell you the truth. On the Day of Judgment, Sodom and Gomorrah will be easier to deal with than that town.
I send you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Warning! Men are going to hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be able to stand trial before the governors and kings because of me. You will testify before them and before those who are not Jews.
"But when they catch you, don't think about why or how to say it. At that moment, they'll give you the words to say."
It's not you who speaks, it's your father's spirit that speaks through you.
"Brothers kill each other for inheritance. Parents hand over their children. And children rebel against their parents and kill them."
Everyone will hate you because of this. But those who stand firm to the end will be saved.
"If people attack you in one place, run to another. What I'm telling you is true. Don't keep walking through Israeli cities until a human being comes to you."
A student doesn't surpass his teacher. A servant doesn't surpass his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what do the others who live there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Every secret is solved and everything hidden is revealed.
What is whispered in the dark, shout in the daylight. What is murmured in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
"They don't sell two sparrows for a penny? And one of them doesn't fall to the ground without your father knowing about it."
He counts even the hairs on your head!
Don't be afraid, you're better than many nightingales.
"What do you think about someone who says in front of people who know me? 'I will only say before God in heaven that I know him.'"
Who would say in front of people that they don't know me? I wouldn't even imagine in front of God in heaven that I don't know Him.
"You don't imagine I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword."
Let's make sons disobey their fathers, daughters not obey their mothers, and daughters-in-law be against their mothers-in-law.
The man's enemies are from his own family.
"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me."
And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me, does not deserve me.
If someone loses their soul, they destroy it. But if someone loses their soul because of me, they find it.
"Whoever receives you receives me. And whoever receives me receives him who sent me."
If one receives a prophet as a prophet, they will receive the reward of the prophet. And if one receives a wali as a wali, they will receive the reward of the wali.
If someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little child in my name, the words I speak are true; they will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus completed his training for the 12 disciples. After that, he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about the works of Christ, he sent his disciples to him.
They said to Jesus, "Are you the one who is supposed to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus said to him, "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen."
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to those who need it.
"Blessed are those who do not give up their faith because of me."
As Jesus' disciples were leaving, he began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If you don't see, what makes you go and see? Someone wearing nice clothes? No. People who wear nice clothes are in the palaces of kings.
And why did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Ah, I'll tell you, more than a prophet.
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"What I'm about to tell you is true. No one is more important in the history of humanity than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him."
From the time of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with great power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the Law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to accept, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
What do we call the people today? Like little kids sitting in the market and shouting at people. They say,
"We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance. We sang you the song of the dead, but you didn't mourn."
**English:** "Where has John gone? He didn't eat or drink like you guys. And people say, 'He has a demon'."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you do. And they said, "This man eats and drinks all the time. He even associates with tax collectors and sinners. The wise prove that wisdom is right." Do not turn away from sin.
Jesus began to speak about the cities where He had performed most of His miracles, saying, "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which were performed in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
"How great will be your punishment, O village of Chorazin! How great will be your punishment, O Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in Tyre and Sidon had been performed in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But we say to you, on the Day of Judgment, God will be more lenient with Sidon and Tyre than with you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the works I did in Sodom had been done in you, it would have remained until today."
But we say to you, on the Day of Judgment, God will ease it for the people of Sodom more than for you. "Comfort for every weary one."
Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."
Oh, dad. This is what you love.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And those who know the father are the son, and those the son chooses to introduce him to.
"Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
Serve me and learn from me. I am gentle and humble. Find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy, and my burden is light."
"Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath."
On the Sabbath, Jesus walked through the wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck the heads of wheat and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! This is unlawful and should not be done on the Sabbath. Yet your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
He entered the house of the Lord. He and his men ate the sacred bread, but only the priests should eat it.
Haven't you read the law? Everyone should read it; everyone should know that the priests in the temple must serve on the Sabbath day. But they are not punished for this.
I'll tell you what's more important than the structure, it's here.
The book says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You don't understand what this means. If you knew what it means, you would not accuse innocent people.
"He was born on Saturday, the son of Adam, the master of the day."
After he left that place, Jesus walked to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and twisted hand. The Pharisees were always looking for a reason to criticize Jesus, so they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, wouldn't you take it out?"
"A man is worth more than a sheep! The law allows us to do good on Saturday."
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it became whole, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, God's chosen servant.
Jesus knew all the plots of the Pharisees. So he left the place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to talk about him.
This was to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken:
Hani Abidi. I've chosen him. He's the one I love. I'm very satisfied with him. I'll give him my all. He's the one who will announce to the whole country that everything will be alright.
He doesn't fight or shout. No one hears his voice in the streets.
It doesn't break a bent stick. It doesn't extinguish a burning fire. It fixes everything.
"These are nations who seek Him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought to Jesus a man possessed by demons. He was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. After that, he could see and speak.
We were all astonished. They kept saying, "Can this be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is casting out his own spirit. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say I cast out demons by Beelzebul, and by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if we drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
"Who would let you enter a strong man's house and take what he owns? First, you need to tie him up, and only after tying him up can you steal his stuff."
"Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who touches the sheep with me will scatter them."
This is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word you say against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
"If you want to make a decorative tree, its fruits will be decorative. If you want to make a useless tree, its fruits will be useless. You can tell a tree by its fruit."
"O den of venomous snakes! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
The good man says good is good. That's from the good preserved within him. The evil man says evil is evil. That's from the evil preserved within him.
But that's what we're telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every word they uttered without responsibility.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." Ayat Yunus al-Mu'jizah
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you."
Reply: "People who are evil and do not fear God ask for miracles. But the only miracle they will get is that of Prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
"The men of Nineveh will stand in judgment with the people who are now living. And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when Jonah preached to them. Now, one greater than Jonah is here."
"The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with those who live in this age, and will prove them guilty. She came from afar to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, one greater than Solomon is here."
"What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry regions, seeking a place to rest, but it finds none."
Then he says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned well and put in order.
Then the unclean spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself. They enter and make a home there, and the man's condition becomes worse than before. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.
Wherever Jesus spoke to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told me, "Your mother and your siblings are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
"Everyone who does what my Lord in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. And all the people stood on the shore.
He told them many stories. He said, "A farmer went to plant his seeds."
He sowed the seed in the ground. Some fell by the wayside. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, the plants burned them. They dried out because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
The rest of the seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was planted.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you speak to people?"
"You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to anyone else."
Those who have that information get even more. In fact, they take a lot. But those who don't have that information, even those who have a little, they take it from them.
This is why we use stories when we talk to people. We say to them, "They see, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. You will indeed see, but you will not perceive what you see."
These people's hearts have deviated. They do not listen to advice with their ears. They have closed their eyes. They only see with their eyes. They do not listen with their ears. They understand with their hearts. They will go to the Lord, and He will heal them.
But congratulations to your eyes for seeing. And congratulations to your ears for hearing.
I'll tell you something true. Many prophets and saints wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! That's the meaning of the farmer's story.
People find the message on the queen and don't understand it. Then the devil comes. He steals what they planted in their hearts. These people are like seeds they planted on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the word and receive it with joy immediately.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not endure for long. They fall away quickly in time of trial or persecution because of the word.
Some people received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth come in, overwhelm them, and prevent them from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on the good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The barley began to sprout and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The farm owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where did the weeds come from?"
He told them, "This is the work of an enemy." And the servants said to him, "Do you want us to remove that grass?"
"No, answered the landowner. 'While you are weeding, you may pull up the wheat along with the weeds."
"Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, harvest the tares. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then, harvest the wheat. Bring it to my house." "The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares"
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man sowed it in his field."
Hi, the smallest seed in your garden. But when it grows, it becomes the largest tree in all the gardens. It stops being a seed and becomes a tree. Birds will come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus told them all these things in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
"And so the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He had said, 'I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from the time of creation.' (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds."
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
The one who sowed the good seed is the son of Adam.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
"Pull up the weeds and burn them in the fire. That's how it will be on the Day of Judgment."
Man was born to send his angels. They will cleanse his kingdom of everything that causes sin. And to rid themselves of all who do evil.
Bake them in the hot oven. That's where they'll cry and bite their teeth.
There are peoples whom my Lord illuminates like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears, let them hear. Tales of hidden treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When one found it, he hid it. He rejoiced with great joy. He went and sold all he had and bought the field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a precious pearl."
He found a very expensive one. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought the pearl. The parable of the net.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. They let it down into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen brought them to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
This is how it will be on the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come and separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will be burned in Hell. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.
Jesus continued telling these stories. Then he left there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished. "Where did he get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is Emma the daughter of the carpenter? Is her mother's name Mary? Are her brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Why aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They didn't like him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He did not perform great miracles there, because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head was severed.
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do these miracles."
Herod seized John. He bound and imprisoned him because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip his brother.
John was telling Herod, "It is against the law for you to take her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted with her.
And He will provide her with all she asks for with His right hand.
Her mother told her what to say. And the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod had John the Baptist's head cut off in prison.
He brought a large plate of food and gave it to the girl. After she took it in her hand, she placed it in front of her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to get away from the crowds for a while. So he took a boat and went to a solitary place. When the people heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him. "There's nothing here," they said. "It's getting late. Send the crowd away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "Let them go and buy food for themselves."
"We only have five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
He said, "Bring them to me here."
Jesus made the people sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments.
The number of men who ate was almost 5000. The women and children ate a lot. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
After dismissing them, he went up the mountain alone to pray. And when night came, he was alone there.
The ship was far from land. It was tossing in the waves due to the wind blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the sea.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they cried, and screamed in fear.
"Friends, it is I. Do not be afraid. Have courage!"
"Master," said Peter, "are you he?" He replied, "You say so. If it is I, come to me on the water."
"He said, 'Come.' So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus."
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind picked up.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
I told the men living there about Jesus. They sent a message throughout the surrounding region. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They begged him to let the sick touch even the fringe of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.
Who makes people "dirty"?
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked,
"Why don't your students listen to the elders? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
My father said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). And he who curses his father or mother shall be put to death (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not like to honor their parents with gifts. You make God's words useless when you follow your own teachings.
"You hypocrites! As Isaiah predicted about you, he said:
"These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me."
"We do not blame them for their worship; they teach us only human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean". What comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean".
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know why the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "What do you think? A man had two sons, and he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in my vineyard.' "Yes, sir," he replied.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. When the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Let's understand this."
"Don't you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it exits the body.
But what comes out of the mouth is what comes from the heart. These are what defile you.
Remove evil thoughts from the heart. Such as murder, adultery, and sexual immorality. And such as theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
These are the things that make a person "unclean." But eating without washing one's hands does not make them "unclean." "Faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus departed from Galilee and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near Sidon and Tyre. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
He didn't say a word. Then the students spoke up. They said, "Leave us alone. Stop yelling at us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell to her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
Answer: "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Ah, sir," she said, "but even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the crippled, the mute, and many others. They placed them before him, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind began to see. This is how the people praised the Lord of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His pupils answered him: "There's nothing here," they said, "Where are we going to get bread to feed all these people?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
I took seven loaves and the fish and praised God. After he had blessed them, he gave them to the disciples. The disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
Four thousand men ate. The women and children ate a lot.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he went on board the boat and made his way to the region near Magdala.
They asked Jesus for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer: "At night you see the sky. You say, 'The weather tomorrow will be nice. The sky is red."
And in the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to take bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked to each other because we didn't bring bread with us.
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "Your faith is small! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments you collected?
How could you not understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread. He was warning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered: "Some people say he is John the Baptist. Others say he is the prophet Elijah. Still others say he is the prophet Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"And who are you to tell me who I should be?" he asked.
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that moment on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He told them that he had to go to Jerusalem, where he would suffer at the hands of the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes. He would be killed andFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFut
"My lord, this must never happen to you!" said Peter, taking Jesus aside and beginning to rebuke him. "This must not happen to you, Lord!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"Why would someone gain the whole world and lose their soul? Or what could possibly be a substitute for one's soul?"
"The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done."
"What I am going to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus is changing.
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
Hani stood before them, his appearance transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes turned as white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elisha appeared before them. Moses and Elisha were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
When Peter spoke more confidently, even his shy friends started to listen. He made them hear a voice from within themselves say, "This is my child, and I love him. I am very proud of him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Get up, do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They went down from the mountain. On the way, Jesus told them what they were to do. "Do not tell anyone what you have seen," he said to them. "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do teachers say that Elias has to come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, it is written that Elijah must come and restore all things."
But we told you, she came and people didn't recognize her. They did to her everything they wanted to do. That's how they treat people's children.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him.
He said, "My lord, have mercy on my son. He is trembling severely and suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your students. But they couldn't cure him.
"You infidels and bastards! Why do we have to stay with you? Why do we have to put up with you? Bring me this boy."
Jesus said to the demon, "Come out of the boy," and it left him. He was healed at that very moment.
The disciples came to Jesus in secret and asked him, "Why can't we cast out demons?"
"Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They gathered in Galilee. And Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum. That's when the tax collectors came to Peter and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he always does that," they answered. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties from? From their own children or from Festival Festival
Peter answered: "Not even the others." Jesus said: "That is how it must be for the children."
"But let's not anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find the exact money you need inside. Take it and give it to the tax collector for you and me."
