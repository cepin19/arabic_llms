Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram. Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hisiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiakin and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
After this, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Azariah. Azariah was the father of Lazarus.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaan. Achimaan was the father of Ahalud.
Eliehod was the father of Eliazar. Eliazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a religious man. He didn't want to shame her in front of people. That's why he planned to divorce her discreetly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
You will give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet,
"The virgin is with child and will give birth to a son, whom she will call Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph arose and took Mary to his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus was born, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
"Where is the child who is born to be the king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, as was all the people of Jerusalem.
Then Herod summoned the wise men and learned where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem of Judea," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them exactly when the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. It stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down to him and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another route. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph arose during the night, and departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was furious. He issued orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys two years old and under had to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who sought to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph rose and took the child and his mother, Mary, and journeyed to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
Here he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the whole region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' and thus be confident before God. I tell you, from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The spade is still leaning against the tree trunk. All the trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water and call you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is stronger than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
"So there was in his hand a pitchfork to carry the hay from his barn. He gathered his wheat into the storehouse. But the chaff he burned with unquenchable fire." Isaiah is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. Jesus said to him, "I need to be baptized by you; and how are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tested.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you bow down to me and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" (Deuteronomy 6:13).
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled. He had said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come and follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So when they heard him, they left their nets and followed him.
After that, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, those possessed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up a mountain, sat down, and his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you for my sake. And blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil things about you falsely for my sake.
Be joyful and cheerful. Your reward in Heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Similarly, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. They will see the good you do and will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the smallest commandment. And do not teach others to break it. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. It was said to them, "Do not murder. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever murders will be subject to judgment."
But this I tell you: Whoever is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, ‘Raka,’ will be subject to the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to hellfire.
Let us suppose that you are presenting your gift at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Try to settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still on your way with him. If you do not, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm telling you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last cent!
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'" (Exodus 20:14)
But that is what I am saying to you. Do not even look at a woman lustfully. For anyone who looks at her lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one eye than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. It is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell. Divorce!"
"When a man has taken a wife and married her, and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he
But this is what I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only because she has been unfaithful.
Once again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you swore to him."
But this is what I say to you. Never make such promises. Don't make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of Earth. This is the place where God's feet stand. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And do not make your oaths a means to deceive others, lest a foot slip after it was firm, and you taste evil for hindering the way of Allah. And for you is a great punishment. And do not exchange the covenant of Allah for a small price. Indeed, what is with Allah is better for you, if you only knew. What you possess will perish, but what is with Allah is enduring. And We will reward those who endured with a reward for the best of what they used to do.
Just let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything more than this comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)"
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
If anyone wants you to go to court with him over your shirt, let him take your coat as well.
Assume someone forces you to go one mile. Go two miles with him.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn away from one who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
"You have heard what was said: 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18). Hate your enemy.' "
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven, for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what reward can you expect? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your family, what are you doing more than others? Even people without religion do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing "righteous deeds" in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in the temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your charity should be a secret, and your Father, who sees what is secret, will reward you. He sees what you do, even in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. What I am telling you is the truth. They have already received their reward.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the wicked do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
When you walk without eating, you do not look as gloomy as those who only pretend to be pious. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your unseen Father will know. And he will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up your treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is the lamp of the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes were bad. Then your whole body would be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will either hate one and love the other, or serve one while wanting to get away from the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
We tell you, do not be afraid. Do not be afraid for your life, or for what you will eat or drink. And do not be afraid for your body, or for what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not things more important for the body than clothes?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothing? Look how the flowers grow in nature. They don't do anything or make clothes.
But that is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
"If God clothes the grass of the field in this way, will He not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. You of little faith!"
So don't worry. Don't ask, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
People without religion run after all this. Your Father in heaven knows you need this.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be just in your judgment of others.
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure by which you measure others.
You notice the straw in your friend's eye, but you don't pay attention to the log in your own.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get some sawdust out of your eyes," when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First take the plank out of your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will open for him who knocks.
Hypothetically, your children asked you for bread. Who among you will give them a stone?
Or suppose he asks for a fish, who among you will give him a live one?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great and the small commandments.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can know their true nature by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them openly: "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise and foolish builders.
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain pours down. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. And it falls with a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Suddenly, the man was cured of his skin disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The centurion believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
"Sir," he said, "my servant is lying at home, unable to move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I have a head on my shoulders, and I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell one, "Go," and he goes. I tell another, "Come," and he comes. And I tell my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I am telling you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown out, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will be done just as you believed." And at that very moment, his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases. We considered him stricken, struck by God, and humbled." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus costs.
Jesus saw the crowds that were surrounding Him. Then He instructed His disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then one of the scribes came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another disciple said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves were beating against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
Dia's pupils woke him up. They said to him, "Sir! Save us! We're going to drown!"
He answered them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. He found two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Have you come here to punish us before the day of reckoning?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went to the town and told everyone. They told the people what had happened to the men who were possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
There came to him two men, one of whom was lame, walking on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. That's why he said to the man, "Do not lose hope, my son. Your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the Pharisees said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. That's why he said to them, "Why are you thinking about something evil in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven" or to say "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went to the house.
When the crowds saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking, he saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick do."
"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said to him, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridefast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't patch a new piece of cloth onto old clothing. The new piece will pull away from the old one. This will only make the tear worse.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. The wineskins will burst, the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. That way, both are preserved."
Just then a synagogue leader came and fell at Jesus' feet. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with them, and so did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She was suffering from a hemorrhage, a condition that had lasted for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
Thoughts: "We won't touch it, it'll heal."
Jesus saw her and called her over. "Woman, you are set free from your affliction," he said. "Your faith has healed you." And at that moment, the woman was healed.
When Jesus entered the governor's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the boisterous crowd.
He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been driven out, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was going from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your belief will grant you your sight."
They could see again. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
As they were going out, they brought to Jesus a mute man possessed by a demon. When the demon was driven out, the man began to speak.
When the demon had left, the man spoke, and the people were amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He was teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them. They were weary and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to join him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first two are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
The two disciples are Philip and Peter, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go to any Gentile or Samaritan town.
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
And when you go, say: "The reward of Paradise is near."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not take with you in your belts gold or silver or copper.
Don't take a travel bag with you. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to host you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If this house welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is true. The Day of Judgment will be easier on Sodom and Gomorrah than on that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before rulers and kings because of Me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, you'll be given the right words to say.
You will not be the speaker, but the spirit of your father will speak through you.
Brothers will deliver up brothers to death. Fathers will deliver up their children. Children will rise up against their parents and cause their death.
Everyone is going to hate you because of me. But whoever endures until the end will be saved.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is truth. You will not finish traversing the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
The pupil is not better than his teacher, and the servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say of his household?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be revealed. Everything that is secret will be made known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
Not even a single hair on your head will be left uncounted!
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set "sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
A man's foes shall be they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If one finds his life, he will lose it. If one loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
By default, if someone receives a prophet as a prophet, they will get the reward of a prophet. And if someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person, they will get the reward of the righteous.
By default, if someone gives even a glass of cold water to a little one, it chases me, the story I'm going to tell you is true. It will certainly be avenged.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples. Afterward, he went to teach and preach in the villages of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Sola asked Jesus: "Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind see. The disabled walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If that weren't the case, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one who is written about in the book. It says: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
"What shall I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling out to each other."
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang you a funeral song, but you did not mourn.
When John came, he didn't eat or drink like you. And people said, "He has a jinn."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." Those cities that did not repent, though he did mighty works in their midst.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. The people there had not repented of their sins. He said:
"How terrible it will be for you, Korazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hell. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
"But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, Sodom will be treated less severely than you." Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad, this is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. The only ones who know the father are the son and those the son chooses to introduce him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart. You will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus went through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick the heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! This is against the law to do on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, he and his men, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for his men, but only for the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It tells how the priests in the temple are to do their work every Sabbath day. But they are not guilty.
We tell you that something more important than the temple is here.
The writing says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Then, Jesus came to the place, and entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and deformed hand. The Pharisees were seeking a reason to accuse Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is worth more than the sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just as new, like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus was aware of the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to tell who he is.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. He says,
Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love and in whom I take great delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear him in the streets.
It won't break a bent twig. It won't extinguish a faint flame. It will correct everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought to Jesus a man possessed by demons. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man could speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. That's why he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons. But by what power do your followers cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this. How do you enter the house of a strong man and take only what the man owns? You must first bind him. Then you can steal his house.
"What isn't with me doesn't exist for me. Whoever doesn't help me herd the sheep is dispersing them."
So this is what I say to you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
If you want the tree to be good, make its root good, and if you want its fruit to be good, make its tree good. You know a tree by its fruit.
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good man speaks good things. They come from the good within him. And an evil man speaks evil things. They come from the evil within him.
But this is what I tell you: On the Day of Judgment, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be condemned or acquitted." - "The Miracle Verse of Jonah"
Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "The evil and disbelieving people ask for a miraculous sign! But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand in the day of judgment with the living nations now. And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nineveh forsook their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now there is One here who is greater than Jonah.
"The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people who are living now. And she will prove by conclusive evidence that they are guilty. She came from a great distance to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now one greater than Solomon is here."
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through desolate places, seeking a resting place, but finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives there, he finds the house empty. It has been swept, cleaned, and put in order.
Then the unclean spirit goes out and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this wicked generation." - Jesus and his brothers
And while he yet spake to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
A person said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
Everyone who does what my father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things through stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds."
Scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They dried out because they had no roots.
Some seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on fertile soil, sprouted, and yielded a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. This has not been granted to outsiders.
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have far too much. If no one has this kind of knowledge, even the little that someone has will be taken away.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
"The hearts of this people have grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing. They have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when tribulation or persecution comes because of the message.
Some received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then worries of life and the deceitful promise of wealth choke the seed and prevent it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. "The Parable of the Weeds"
Jesus told the crowd another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's slaves came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did these weeds come from?"
"It's the enemy who did this," he replied. "The servants asked: 'Do you want us to go and uproot these weeds?'"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with the weeds."
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus said to the crowds another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a person took and sowed in their field."
It is the smallest of your seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest tree in the garden. It becomes a great tree, and the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus told the people all these things through parables. He did not say anything to them without using a story.
The words of the prophet were fulfilled. He had said, "I open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will be thrown into the burning fire. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it. And for joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together all kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the fiery furnace. There, the wicked will wail and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus went on to tell many more parables, then left the crowd.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogues. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where does he have the power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They didn't like him at all. But Issa told them, "A prophet is not respected in his own country. He doesn't receive any respect in his own home."
He did not do many miracles there, because they did not have faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
That same day, Herod the ruler over Galilee and the region of the Sea of Galilee heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests. He was greatly pleased with her.
So he promised her by an oath to give her all that she should ask.
Her mother said to her, "What do you wish?" And she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she requested.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
They put his head on a large plate and gave it to the girl. She now picked it up and took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a secluded place. The crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "The place is deserted, and the hour is already advanced. Send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves and two fish," they answered.
He said, "Bring them to me here."
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Even the women and children ate. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then He dismissed the crowd.
After they left, he went up the mountain to pray alone, and night came while he was still there by himself.
The boat was too far from the shore. The waves were crashing against it due to the wind blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and drew back in terror. "That's a ghost!" they said, and screamed in fear.
Jesus immediately called out to them: "Take heart! I am here! Do not be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there had heard about Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding areas. The people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to allow the sick to touch just the fringe of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus and asked,
"Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God to follow your tradition.
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship is of no benefit to me; they do only what their own wills command them to do." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
It's not what goes into your mouth that makes you "unclean"; it's what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted.
Leave them alone. They are blind guides. If a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. And then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come from the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual vices. And also theft, false witness, and slander about others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived in that area came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Master! Help me!" she said.
He replied: "It's not right to take the bread from your children and give it to their dogs."
She said, "Yes, sir." "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus departed from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee, then went up a mountain and sat down.
They came to him in large numbers. They brought the blind and the lame, the paralyzed, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
So the people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking, the lame were walking, the blind were seeing, and the crippled were healed, and the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we find enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men I counted was 4000. Even the women and children ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a wondrous sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer: "At night, you look at the sky. You say: The weather will be good. The sky is red."
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Jesus' disciples crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The disciples discussed this among themselves, saying, "He says this because we have no bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. That's why he told them, "Your faith is very weak! Why are you talking among yourselves about the lack of bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? How many baskets full of pieces did you gather?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not advising them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say it is John the Baptist; others say it is Elijah; still others say it is Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "No, Lord! This must never be your fate!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to preserve his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
"What good is it to gain the whole world and lose one's soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
Truly, the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I am telling you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Transformation of Jesus
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James. He brought them up to a high mountain by themselves.
Here before them, his form changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothing became white as light.
Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they raised their heads, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were walking, Jesus told them what they must do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said to them. "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked: "Why do legal experts say that Elias should come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came forward to Jesus. He knelt before him.
"Sir," he said, "have mercy on my son. He trembles greatly and suffers much. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
"I brought it to your students, but they couldn't fix it."
"You faithless and evil people!" Jesus answered. "How much longer must I stay with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the child, and it did. He was healed at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, that is enough. You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
Translation
They gathered in Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were deeply saddened. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect them from their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children don't have to pay," Jesus told him.
"But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find there the very coin you need. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and you."
