Jesus called a little child to him and set the child among them.
Jesus said, "What I am about to tell you is true. You need to change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one such little child in my name, welcomes me."
"But what if someone were to entice one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? It would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea."

"If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever."
"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell." (Matthew 18:9) **The Parable of the Lost Sheep**
Beware that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
Translation
What are you thinking about? Imagine a man has 100 sheep, and one of them gets lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep in the mountains and go search for the lost one?
What I am about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be more glad about it than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
The same is true of your Father in heaven. He doesn't want to lose even one of these little ones. When someone does you wrong
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
"But what if they do not listen to you? Take one or two others along, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you seal on earth will be sealed in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, this is what I am telling you: Demand from those near to you on earth, agree upon something that you will ask for, and He who is in heaven will give it to you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them." The unrelenting servant.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
While the king was about to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man couldn't pay, so his uncle issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his belongings had to be sold to repay his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady was moved by his situation, forgave him and set him free.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe me!'
The other servant fell on his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The remaining servants saw what happened. They were very affected. They went to tell their master everything that happened.
Then the lord called the first servant inside. He said to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant, as I showed mercy to you?
In anger, his lord delivered him to the jailers. He shall be punished until he has paid back all that he owed.
So will My Father who is in heaven do also to you if you do not forgive from your hearts your brother.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large groups followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning God made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Then why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said to him: "If that's the case between a husband and his wife, it's better they don't get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those whom God has helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot beget children like they themselves were begotten. Others are begotten thus by others. And others allow themselves to become such that they may serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can live thus should do so." The children are brought to him by Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus answered, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Warn your nearest kinsmen" (Poets 214) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Attributes 19:18)
"I have obeyed all those commandments," the young man said. "What more should I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you, it is harder for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
"What I tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you too will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
Anyone who leaves houses or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around 9 a.m., he went out again. He saw others standing in the square doing nothing.
He told them: "You go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you a fair wage."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing."
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last hired and going on to the first."
The workers who were hired arrived around five o'clock. Each of them received their regular daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they began to suspect its owner.
These people who were hired recently only worked for one hour, they said. "You treated them like us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day."
The landowner replied to one of them, "Friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I want to pay the people I hired recently the same salary I paid you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Are you feeling resentful because I've been generous to others?
"But many who are last will be first, and the first last." Jesus speaks again about his upcoming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We're going forward to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death.
Then they will hand him over to the people who are not Jewish. They will mock him and beat him. They will crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead! "A mother asks a favor of Jesus"
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's sons with her sons. And she bowed down to him, and asked a certain request of him.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise that the other will sit at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus told them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever among you wants to be important should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like a son of Adam. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many people free." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They begged them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Master! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt a deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples ahead.
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, tell them God needs it. The owner will send it to him as it is.
This happened so that what was said by the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the mare. They put their blanket for them. Then Jesus sat on their blanket.
Large crowds spread carpets on the roads. Others cut tree branches and spread them on the roads.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed him. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
They came to Jesus at the temple, the blind and the lame, and he healed them there.
They saw the chief priests and scribes performing miracles. They also saw the children in the temple courts shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David." But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read in the Scriptures? 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city, going to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem, and he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found only leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" From that moment on, the tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed and said, "How did this fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done. Whatever you ask for in prayer, you will receive."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." The authority of Jesus is challenged.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'of men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
The two sons answered, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." - The Parable of the Two Sons
What are you doing in this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work in the vineyard today."
"I won't go," the boy answered. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw this, but even then you did not turn from your sins and believe him. The story of the tenants.
Hear another parable. A man had a vineyard, and he planted it with vines; he built a fence around it, dug a winepress, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went into another country.
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servant to the tenants, to collect his share of the produce.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated the servants in the same way.
In the end, he sent his sons to them. "They will respect my son," he said.
But the tenants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will take all the owner's possessions when he dies. Let's kill him. Then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
"Those wicked men will be ruined," he replied. "Then others will lease the land. They will give him his share of the harvest at the time of gathering."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that rock will be broken into pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus spoke other parables to them, many parables, all in parables.
It is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. The servants ordered them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent some more servants. "Tell the invited guests," he said, "that my banquet is ready. I have slaughtered my fattened calf and everything is set. Come to the wedding feast."
But people didn't pay attention. One went to his farm. Another went to his business.
The rest took their servants. They tortured and killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servant, "The wedding dinner is ready. But those I invited were not worthy to come."
I'm going to the alleys. Leave dinner to me, whoever you find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they found, both good and bad. Soon the banquet hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests, and saw a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Friend," he asked her, "how did you get in here without your wedding dress?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servant, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him outside into the darkness. There he will weep and gnash his teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against Jesus, to entrap Him in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are honest and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, nor do you treat people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said, "You snakes! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. Bring him a silver coin.
"Whose is this picture? And what's all this talk about?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. "Marriage is when the dead rise."
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his brother's name.
We were seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he didn't have any children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers, it even happened to the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the dead rising from their graves? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. It was a new teaching—with authority!
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was a scholar, so he tried to test Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second commandment is like the first: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. And Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Where is his father?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him Lord, when he says in the Book of Psalms:
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
If David called him "my lord," how could he be his son?
No one could get a word out of him. Since then, no one has dared to ask him even a single question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
So you have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do as they do. They don't follow what they say.
They pile heavy loads on others' shoulders, but they themselves don't want to lift a finger to move them.
All that they do, they do it for people to see. They carry on their foreheads and arms small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the ribbons on their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at dinners. They also love to have the most important seats in the temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. And they love it when people call them "Sir."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher.' You have one teacher, and it is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who raises his head will lower it, and he who lowers it will raise it.
What a terrible thing you are doing, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you prevent those who are trying to enter.
Translation
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"You blind fools! How much longer will you go on being so misguided? You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' "
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the temple that makes gold sacred?
Without a doubt, he says, "If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath."
O men of blind understanding! What is more important? Is it the gift? Or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the sanctuary, swears by it and by whoever is in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, he has sworn by the throne of Allah and by Him who is on it; it is indeed a truth and what is between them.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former."
O you blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You only try to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, and the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
The same for you. From the outside, you seem to be doing what's right. But inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous.
And they say, "If we had lived in the times of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets."
So you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
And complete the sins that others have started for you, those who lived before you!
"O nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to fire?"
So I will send you prophets and sages and teachers. You will kill some of them, and you will crucify others, and you will flog others in your synagogues, and you will drive them out from town to town.
"Then you will pay the price for all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm going to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you would not let me!
Look, your house is empty.
We say to you, you will not see me until you say: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. And the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being led astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You're going to hear about wars. You're going to hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. This has to happen. But the end is not here yet.
A nation will fight a nation. A kingdom will fight a kingdom. People will suffer from hunger. Earthquakes will occur in many places.
This is all the beginning of labor.
Then they will deliver you up to be tortured and killed, and all nations will hate you because of me.
In those days, many will turn away from the faith. They will hate each other, and they will hand some of them over to their enemies.
Many false prophecies will arise. They will deceive many people.
Because of the abundance of evil, the love of many will grow cold.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
Prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) standing in the holy place, which the reader must understand.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof goes down to their house to get something.
No one in the field goes back to get their coat.
How dire the situation will be for pregnant women these days! How dire for nursing mothers!
Pray to God that you won't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be great tribulation in these days, greater than at any time from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
"At that time people will say to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' Do not believe it."
False Christians and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If you are told, "It's far out in the desert," don't go. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west; that's how it will be on the day when the Son of Man comes.
Sheep gather wherever there is a corpse.
"Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a mighty blast of the trumpet. He will gather His chosen ones from the four corners of the earth. He will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Take heed of the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The people who were living at that time will certainly not die until all those things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour.
"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
It is known to them, but they don't know why it will happen until the flood comes and takes them all. That will be the case from the day Adam's son comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two mills with grindstones, one they will take and one they will leave.
"So trust in Allah; indeed, you are on the clear truth. So let those who oppose his command beware lest a trial strike them or a painful punishment." "So be on guard against a day when your Lord will come; you will not know from where it will come."
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have guarded his house. He wouldn't have let the thief break into his house.
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not think, the Son of Man is coming.
Let's suppose that a master appointed one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. This servant's task is to distribute food to them at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this task.
It would be good for the servant if the master found him doing his work when he returns.
What I am about to tell you is true. Mr. will make that servant responsible for all that he owns.
But suppose that servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is away for a long time."
Hypothetically, he starts beating other servants. And hypothetically, he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then his master will tear him to pieces and send him to the place where the imposters go. There people will lament and cry.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
Here is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that hour. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
Fools took their lamps but did not bring olive oil with them.
The wise men took oil in vessels with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So, all the guests got tired and left.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the bridesmaids woke up and prepared their lamps.
The fools said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil, for ours has run out, and our lamps will go out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
They went to buy oil. But on their way, the bride came. The grooms who were ready went with him to the wedding dinner. Then they closed the door.
Later, the rest of the bridesmaids also came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am telling you is true. I do not know you."
Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The parable of the three servants.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was about to go on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could manage. Then he continued on his journey.
The servant who earned 10,000 dirhams immediately started investing his money and made another 10,000 dirhams.
He who wins 4000 dirhams wins another 4000 dirhams.
But the man who took the $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received 10,000 dirhams brought in another 10,000 dirhams. "Sir," he said, "you gave me the confidence of 10,000 dirhams. Look, I've made another 10,000 dirhams."
His lord answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
The man who had $4000 also came. He said, "Sir, you blessed me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000."
His lord answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
Then came the man who had received $2000. "Sir," he said, "I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not plant seeds.
So I was afraid, and I went and buried your two thousand dollars in the ground. See, this is what belongs to you.
The lady replied, "You servant of evil and lazybones! Do you know that I am reaping where I did not sow? Do you know that I am gathering the harvest where I did not scatter the seed?"
Alright then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have collected it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take the one thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has ten thousand."
To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But those who do not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
Throw this useless servant out. There in the dark, people will groan and gnash their teeth. 'The sheep and the goats'
The Son of Man will come in his glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. People will be separated into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on the right and the goats on the left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world."
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me in.
I was in need of clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
Then those who did good deeds will answer: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The King will reply: "What I am about to tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you didn't invite me in. I needed clothes. But you didn't give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you didn't visit me.
They will also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and not feed you? Or thirsty and not give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and not welcome you? Or naked and not clothe you? Or sick or in prison and not visit you?"
He will reply: "What I am telling you is true. Anything you haven't done for one of these unfortunate people, you haven't done for me."
Then they will go away to be punished forever. But those who did what is right will receive eternal life.
The plot to kill Jesus (peace be upon him)
He set out and said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
Devise a clever plan to arrest Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold for a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me.
The poor will always be with you, but I will not always be with you.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
And among the created things are the key and the news, and among the news are the key and that which is not a key. And the key is that which necessitates.
Sool: "What will you give me if Jesus greets you?" They counted out thirty pieces of silver for him.
From that hour, Judas sought an opportunity to betray Jesus to them. The Lord's Supper.
The first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread came, and the disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He answered them, "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him to the house, and tell the owner, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them. They prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me and hand me over to my enemies."
The students were very confused. One by one, they started saying to him, "Not me, sir, what?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
"A son of Adam will walk as it is written for him. But how much torment will there be for the one who delivers the son of Adam! It would have been better for him if he had not been born."
Judas is the one who will hand him over. He said, "It's not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke, and gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "All of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, you will all fall away from me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7)."
"But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter answered: "Everyone else can leave because of you. But I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "It will happen this very night. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Wait here while I go and pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, John and James, and began to feel grief and distress.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell face-first to the ground. He prayed: "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But do what you will, not what I want."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"See how I am delivered. After I fall into sin when I am tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went a second time and prayed, "Father, if this cup may be taken away from me, let it be, yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. A third time he prayed for the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! To the place where they will hand me over!" The arrest of Jesus.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had agreed with them on a signal. "The one I kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that time, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword. He went up to the high priest's servant and cut off his ear.
"Put your sword away," Jesus told him. "All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would send an army of over 70,000 angels right away.
But how will the sacred texts be fulfilled then? They say that it must happen this way.
At that hour Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a band of armed men against you? Why do you not arrest me now? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who arrested Jesus brought him before Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the elders of the law came there.
As soon as he had gone, Peter followed Jesus. He entered the courtyard of the high priest and sat down with the guards, waiting to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer anything? What is it that these witness against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered. "It is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need further witnesses? You have heard his evil words yourselves."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They hit him with their hands. And they slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said that was not so. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't him. He swore, saying: "I don't know this man!"
After a short while, those who were standing there approached Peter and said to him, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt ashamed and deeply regretted his actions. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I released an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Then Judas threw the silver into the temple and left, and went and hanged himself.
The chief priests consulted together, and said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is the price of blood."
They decided to use the money to buy a clay field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it's still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then were fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value.
"They paid the potter thirty pieces of silver, just as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus did not answer even a word, not even to one accusation. The governor was very much amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the people were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While he was sitting on his royal throne, his wife sent him a message: "Be careful of that righteous man. I suffered greatly because of him in a dream today."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which one do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"So what do you want me to do with Jesus, called the Messiah?" asked Pilate. And all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Seeing that he was getting nowhere with them, Pilate took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he scourged Jesus with whips. Then he handed him over to be crucified on the cross. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers led Jesus to the prison known as the Praetorium, and all the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They dressed him and put a purple cloak on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and dressed him in his own clothes. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
As they led him out of the city, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
He went to a place called Skull. The word "Skull" means "place of the skull."
Here they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
After they crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat there with their guards.
Above his head they placed the written charge: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
And they said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
The chief priests, scribes, and elders did the same, mocking him.
They said, "He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He believes in God. May God save him now if He wills it. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those standing there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Then one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Let it be him. We'll see what Elias will get him to pay."
After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom, the earth shook, and the rocks split.
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards who were with Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that happened, and they became very afraid. They said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. There were also Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
God received Joseph's body and wrapped it in a clean shroud.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said to him, "Sir, we remember something that liar said while he was alive. He used to say, 'In three days I will rise from the dead.'"
"Then he ordered that the tomb be guarded until the third day. If you don't give this order, his disciples will come and steal the body, and then they will tell people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first."
Pilate answered, "Take a guard. Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a guard to watch over it.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath was over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to examine the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. An angel came down from God out of heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shines like lightning. His clothes are white as snow.
The guards feared him so much that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He's not here! Just as he said he would, he's risen! Come and see the place where he used to sleep.
"Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Peace be with you!" he said. They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
And behold, there were women who had come from the tomb, telling the disciples. When the guards heard this, they went to the elders and told them everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers: "We want you to say: 'His disciples came at night, stole his body, and we are unaware.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll bribe him. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The last orders of Jesus to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. Yet some still had their doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, saying: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord; make straight his paths.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins, and then God would forgive them.
All the people came out to him from every quarter of the country, and they confessed their sins. John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John preached: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so mighty that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Jesus came up out of the water, and immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice called out to him from heaven, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
When his days of apprenticeship were completed, God sent him into the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Hijaz. He used to preach the beautiful words of God.
"The time has come," he said. "God's kingdom is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come and follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So when they heard him, they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he was walking, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. Jesus cast out a demon.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
So the people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
At that moment, a man in their synagogue shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a shout.
All the people were amazed. They wondered among themselves, "What is this? A new teaching! And with such authority! He even commands unclean spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately, they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
So he walked over to her, took her hands, and helped her stand up. The fever had broken. Then she started working for them.
That night after the sun had set, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them, and they had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons, but he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus was praying in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
He went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus healed a man who had leprosy.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt before Jesus and pleaded, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be made clean!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus immediately rebuked him. He sternly warned the man.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go to the priest and reveal it to him. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a proof against the priest and a help to us, even if you have not seen 'the Pure One'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it widely and spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town. He stayed in remote places, but people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum. When the people heard that he had returned home, they gathered to see him.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no more room, and not even outside the door was there space. Jesus preached to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some scholars were sitting there. They were thinking.
"Why is this man speaking this way? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!"
Immediately, Jesus knew what they were thinking. That's why he said to them, "Why are you thinking about this?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said to me, "I'll tell you, get up. Take your umbrella and go home."
The man got up and took his mat. Then he went home, and everyone was astonished. Everyone marveled and gave thanks to God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chose Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. There were many tax collectors and "sinners" eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. They asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. People came to Jesus and said, "John's disciples fast, and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but yours do not. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't patch a new piece of fabric onto old clothing. If they do that, the new piece will pull away from the old one. It will make that tear worse.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be lost. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the wheat fields with his disciples. They began to pluck the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
This was in the days of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat, and also gave it to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and withered hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around at them in anger and was deeply distressed because of their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. The multitudes were following Jesus.
Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard of all that Jesus was doing. Many came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and from Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus ordered his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. That way, people would not be able to crowd around him.
Jesus was healing many people. So the sick were pressing forward to touch him.
When the people saw those possessed by evil spirits, they fell down before him. And the spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, and they were with him, and he sent them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus established the twelve, and among them was Simon, whom Jesus named Peter.
There were Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name "Boanerges," which means "Sons of Thunder."
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus. And there were Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them, he who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered, so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it, that's what made them go and get him in his condition. They said, "This man is mentally ill."
There came to him some of the Jews from Jerusalem and said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out demons."
Then Jesus called the people to him and said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
