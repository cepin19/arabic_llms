This is a shame! It's an opportunity we're not going to waste.
Likewise, I don't interfere. I have the right to take, and you actually have the right to take before me.

Salih, don't be ... God forgives what has passed!
Oh brother, would a brother advise his brother with what you're saying?

And I found a great feast.
The holiday isn't anyone's right.
Say it to yourself.
This holiday won't come around again.
Don't be strange, Saleh!
And keep us away from temptation.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone benefits.
This is the law!
Even people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control of the situation.
International Third Millennium Shores, specifically the first phase of infrastructure.
You fool!
Here we can loot!
If he refuses to take it.
Who gave you the right?
You have no right to exploit her.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who was supposed to take him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to fix your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and stubborn.
Enjoy yourself a little.
See your uncle Thursday.
And now, as they say, he's a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The other third is a commission.
Who plays in a folk band,
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
Do you know what they did?
He added a zero.
No use, oh Auntie!
No, God will guide him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
This is an opportunity.
For the triumph of good.
And God willing, good will prevail.
This is common.
Just keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about it.
Do we need to worry?
But my friends
Headache.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him soon.
And we must convince him.
It cuts off our benefit.
I swear, they made him change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Uthman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day of work.
Rely on me.
How could you not take it!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you.
If you are hungry and walking down the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The dish is large.
We're still working on the opening address for the meeting.
If you are okay,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know is
It's legitimate.
May God guide you, Saleh.
This is reasonable because you're a boss for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We guarantee our contribution.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So no one suspects what we're doing.
To put our share as a separate item!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
It's not possible.
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said it!
Let's say it's his friend's car.
At a very distinguished location as well!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear this talk from people.
He told me to buy the land and register it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he's going to start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to take anything?
We end up not getting anything!
He wants to eat it all by himself, the glutton.
Don't nod your head!
And not your brother
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked with him all night.
I told him, "Whatever the case, they are your relatives."
He finally agreed.
This is how things should be.
And God willing, you won't take it all at once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
Specifically, infrastructure.
Later, they will start the second phase.
And it will continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
Good that you pressured him into agreeing.
There's no difference between you and them.
But, it doesn't matter.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a cut.
Until he said after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to determine the project's budget.
They need to follow up, it's their money.
We've set it and are certain about it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He's my foster brother who shares with me.
Do you mean that?
We are responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to final finishes.
Zayn, Zayn
How much do you want to finish?
How much will it cost?
We take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And we'll set the amount of money we'll take.
You have people waiting and wanting a little.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million,
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
They specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will decide exactly what they want.
It's not up to you.
Then, it's up to you?
Ignore him.
Hey buddy, what's up? What's wrong?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hey! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Salih, your brother's name is Sultan!
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car is broken down.
Write.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are three other people.
What else can I do, I'm bored of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and be done."
No, no, this takes a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
Poor guy, does he have kids?
Yes, make it twenty-five thousand and four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much are you giving them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, as we were just talking about her.
Yes, indeed, Mother.
Ah, no, no, no, this one here, my son!
No, my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's going on?
Why are you upset?
Only from the first phase, specifically the infrastructure.
What is used?
Add three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand with Strass sparkle.
Did you add her?
Yes, indeed, Mother.
Mom, I added her, but I just wanted to double-check the name.
Oh dear, mother.
Let's increase the determination.
Yes, but the budget needs to be set; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting, and everyone should specify the amount they want.
I have this.
Is a million enough?
My dear Wade
Guys, wait, there's noise, give us a chance.
The committee is in a meeting now to approve the project's budget. The topic of money is not up for discussion right now, that's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh my God, we're screaming, don't draw attention to us.
If someone comes and asks, "What's wrong with all of you?"
We tell him that the electricity is out or broken.
Do not make noise in the ministry's courtyard.
This text is in English.
Sew it! Do you hear me!
Where were you with them? What's the budget now?
Without counting my brother
Completely, fifty million bees.
Fifty million only for the first phase.
How much is it now?
What, Saleh?
Participation is caring, man!
Bon appétit.
Come on, guys, hurry up let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem. The most important thing is that we don't want any discussions; let them agree on the budget and that's it.
And implementation starts tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of the community.
May God bless you, this is the International Third Millennium Beaches Project.
This is the first stage.
In other words, infrastructure.
This is for the coming generations.
Absolutely, and on behalf of our team, we'd like to congratulate you on the launch of the project that will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
It took us a thousand and five hundred years.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
May God perpetuate the blessing of oil upon us.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
actor
Welcome aboard.
Why have we been gathered here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Where are they taking us?
Alhamdulillah, I've grown up and she's started to ramble.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, indeed, she's a kind girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they isolate you?
Eman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
This is not my land.
I saw a farm in the desert and said, "This must be your father's."
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Those who work hard and invest in land, real estate, businesses, and make an effort.
Ridden of the headache.
I am disappointed in you, O trust!
And also, my sister.
How do you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than honesty.
"Because of the money."
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years they spent in court fighting with their siblings.
Nine years, maybe more.
No, but
The brothers of Umm Salma are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I don't say your brothers are like that, God willing they aren't.
How many years has my father been deceased?
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
And what else do you want?
What does the check bounce every three months?
Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not in her hands.
If it was someone else, even his sisters wouldn't get a single penny.
I have it.
Where from?
It's like it's not my money.
See what, Monira
Please look at him.
Becomes fifty thousand.
Because I was brave and asked about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What should I say, oh Manira!
I won't stop fighting for my rights.
Taking my right
It's best to invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
There's no mercy among people these days.
Don't think your brothers will be better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court frequently.
And in the end
I didn't get anything out of it.
Why do they do that?
This is the reason I'm telling you, my dear, be kind to them.
Treat them kindly.
And you get bored of them.
Why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand of us.
If we reach a million like other countries.
By God, I don't think, ya Ghalia, that an order will be issued.
Look at my brothers.
I swear to God, I don't want all this.
Oh my God, what do I say!
All I can say is, "God protect us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us."
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us.
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, oh dear!
We asked the judge to write a memo.
We've been in this situation many times.
My dear, they will invest millions, and you will just watch.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And no one will take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'm satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We don't owe you anything.
The men ask you!
She has some.
Just some questions about her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you find him.
I'll drag you and show you.
He always finds his way.
I signed a waiver.
"Sixty-five is more than enough for her, her husband works."
Take it or leave it.
Why are you asking now?
But he is greedy.
As if it's not my right.
This is my father's inheritance, and he will decide how much I get. Take it or leave it.
It's neither mine nor his to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
Because of the money.
Opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, oh Nasser!
Land, real estate, and buildings are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they take.
Even the company,
It's your right to ask about everything.
And I won't leave them alone.
How do you get back to them?
It's none of your business.
Don't worry about it, I have the right to know everything.
I'm sorry.
Your sister gave him a formal power of attorney.
He is allowed to inspect almost everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He's shouting at us.
Falcon, enough.
My brother Nasser
Sorry, I'll take
Yes, sir.
Go away, now.
Sorry, walk.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
And he said: "I hit him."
That means we let him do what he wants!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
This is his legal right to search everything.
If he has a look at the budget and accounts.
We give them forty thousand every three months.
If you're checking the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight.
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is as much as we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
There's nothing scary, we're not afraid.
If he differs, this is what we got, and if he agrees, welcome him.
Let them go and deal with her.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what was supposed to happen from the beginning.
Here is
As he likes.
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, my lord.
File by file
When she knew her true heritage,
Villas and lands about which you knew nothing.
They came out seven.
They turned sixteen years old.
She didn't know.
Poor thing, she was shocked.
This isn't working.
Don't leave them alone.
Goodness, my son, I don't want to hear about the courts.
The more interested you are,
A judge is rarely impartial.
Half a minute
Then he will say his usual sentence,
To the seventh, the fourth, the two thousand, I don't know how much.
They get very happy, my son.
You were never supposed to get out of bed, Mom!
May God heal you.
No, no, please come in.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we slammed the door in his face and fired him from the company.
One of my schoolmates sends.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't let him.
I mean, can he influence them?
Inshallah, he will do it.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but generate reports.
Delays and excuses, lawyers are no help.
Years pass.
And the years pass by.
And you're not going to get a single penny.
God bless Umm Salama's mother.
You advised me the day before you died.
Never go to court.
Our judge said
She died without taking any of her inheritance.
She passed away while the judge was still to settle her case.
And what if we were like other countries?
Hello Abdullah
Abdullah's brother
Years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
May you be raised in prosperity.
The most important thing
Brothers
My brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't let money problems...
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
It's correct.
They don't even want me to take my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife...
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We're trying one last time.
I sent them your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they even fired him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdurrahman will do.
This man is very kind.
Surely Nasser said.
Don't worry.
Scare them with the law.
Did you forget what poor Umm Salma said about the courts?
The brothers of Umm Salma might not fear courts.
But my brothers
They might be afraid of rumors.
They might be ashamed to go to court.
To wait and see what will happen after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit to them.
God bless you.
Is this a Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What are you saying, my son?
Tells the truth
Go away.
Going to court tomorrow morning.
Why do I have to wait until tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What will happen if I wait until after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid.
This is a promise.
I told you before.
Let's intimidate them with the law.
Now, he's begging me to postpone going to court.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's important to visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is? This...
May God bless you all.
A miniature model of the courthouse building.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God protect you.
What didn't you say?
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until after tomorrow.
To obtain that sample, go to the courthouse this week.
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through this door, over there.
When you enter through the door,
Put all your things over there.
Your phone and anything metallic so it doesn't make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
Register the case, they will ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight elevator go.
Circle around the desks.
See the judge, if you need a specific judge for instance.
Also, these.
They want to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your revenge.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're having dinner at my sister's house tonight.
Ah, has the ministry approved his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, he couldn't believe it.
He said, "If they agree on the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
Oh, happiness of Abu Waleed!
Lucky is he
My sister told me that he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Oh Manal!
He doesn't know much about business, but some men helped him.
Alright, tell your father the truth.
God willing, you liked the food.
Thank you very much, Abu Waleed!
Thank you very much, Abu Waleed, may God bless you.
May God fill your life with wealth.
This food is really delicious, Umm Waleed.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me just rent an office and that's it, they'll take care of everything.
Go ahead and take some, uncle.
Oh my darling, my son.
My father has a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
Look, he's better-looking now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you'd give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project owner, my father, Bou Walid.
Sorry.
Congratulations to you, Abu Waleed!
You deserve it.
But, frankly, you don't have experience in business and trade.
Man! There's a story behind this project.
"How are you?"
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
What I know about her now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, which our ministry is looking for. Submit the request to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
What understands
Who is the contractor?
The Japanese are wonderful.
When you turn it on, the computer says: "Computer."
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, click on Kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid some.
Insurance amount
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place my first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said, "Fahad is not here."
Do you want to drink tea?
Oh, Father of Waleed, tell me, what have you done!
You don't know Bou Fahd, he might come and he might not.
He will suddenly appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
Come on, don't be late!
You are the boss here.
Are you going to kill me?
No, he must sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Abu Fahd's signature.
Ha! What should I do?
Good health to you.
It's one twenty now, Abu Waleed!
It's time to go home.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
May God help you, come tomorrow.
I've known the manager for a long time, and he's your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He's a useless manager.
A very stupid manager, he doesn't do anything.
It's wrong for them to pretend to be wise when they're not.
It's not worth anything useful.
Do they do anything? Never!
They don't move the chair without Bou Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
What if he asks about you?
Not only you are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please take a seat.
Or take a walk.
After he finishes talking to you.
If something happens, don't scare them.
Goodbye
Sorry for scaring you, this is my wife.
Oh, I wish! They agreed to my appointment from two months ago.
I just need him to sign, what's this?
Oh, my son! This is the registration period. My daughter will miss the university scholarship if we don't finish her papers.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers will be signed.
He drinks his coffee, once he's done, you can come and see him.
Come on, he asked all of you to be quiet.
Hey, boss.
Goodbye
Wait, wait people!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a unique voice.
I'm tired of this.
Our interest has stopped, brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What can we do, we'll wait for Fawaz.
Peace be upon you, father.
They don't blame him.
Everything is destroyed.
The factory is in Japan.
I told him the time was up.
Your aunt is a different story.
Poor thing, she lent him money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Oh, mother, I'm very afraid for my father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you calling?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
He talks about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Oh father, how long do you want me to wait?
They always say,
We are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Oh father, you've done your best.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Okay, who are you calling?
Wait for Bu Fahd.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
You've been very patient with us.
Good health to you.
Bu Waleed is in a pitiful state.
He is shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
This is because the time period is about to end.
There are five days left.
He's losing all his money.
God protect us.
How nice! It pulls me, pulls me, pulls me.
God willing, I'll get better, I feel.
I have a strange fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely stationary.
Half of my body isn't working because of the fever.
This is a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
My sister helps.
You're waiting until we pay her back.
May Allah reward her with good.
We're not worried about your sister now.
My boss is still here, God help me.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what he wants to do.
I'm disturbed by him and Bu Fahd.
He pulls me, that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth is going to be gone.
Don't pull us.
In the brain, precisely in the brain.
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Ould
I'm calling you because I feel sorry for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
You were a good role model.
Don't think I don't know about you leaving work early every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
Has your device recovered?
Instead of deducting from you.
I'll leave you in the stocks committee.
You're going to go to the market with them today.
You never leave work during working hours.
If I do
Then don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him looking perplexed, holding his phone waiting for a call from them?
I'm afraid he'll get fired.
This is my phone, Abu Waleed!
Poor him.
Let him go, poor thing.
Oh God! Abu Waleed
Yeah, hello.
What's wrong with you, Abu Waleed? I'm talking to you, not the phone!
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
This is the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Or you want?
House by house
Walk forward.
Oh people, this man has gone crazy!
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you have been...
Taking papers, returning papers.
My knee is weakening now.
Navigating between all these ministries
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back like children carry a bag of chips.
Then, God's will, I learned to ride a bicycle.
Especially the bike I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They run over me a lot when I ride this bike, oh my god.
This is our daily life, and raising our children.
The manager arrived.
We should celebrate after it's over.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Okay, what do you say about the job?
I bear witness that you are truly a good citizen.
"Welcome, dear friend. Now I will rest. Goodbye."
We are all for you.
Don't you want us to give you a one-year extension?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You've already given me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children are employed now.
Lastly, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery driver.
Drug dealer
Do you believe this?
I haven't eaten ham in four years.
They are delicious!
I can smell it now.
I'll do anything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm boring.
Done, finished.
In constant contact
My son, Khalid
From this moment on,
Insha'Allah I'll rest, Insha'Allah.
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the HR department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he can't leave the job.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Do you let him rest?
Poor thing, he's happy to be coming home early.
He called and said that Khalid... (It cuts)
I sent him to finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone relies on themselves.
My mother regrets the cannoli.
Oh mother, it won't break.
How I regret sparing you, my daughter.
But I say from the day he resigned from the job and left.
And Khalid gave him tasks to do.
He's sleeping in his room.
Those Lost at Sea (Singing)
Good morning, father.
Hello, my daughter.
Oh daddy please
But they called me and said the manager was angry.
Give me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the kids fend for themselves. Why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Poor me.
I'm waiting for you while the ice cream seller is in front of me.
We'll eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, dear father.
Good health to you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I left, my daughter, I left!
Oh God, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God willed it.
Good that you found the house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
How can I help you, Umm Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, I should help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
And he spread it out for me to eat.
Poor thing, he's very tired.
And from the taxis
He is naive.
The market branch is closed.
They want to know her identity.
I didn't even take her car.
And she gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I was moving from one ministry to another.
I ran from one ministry to another.
Finishing my children's papers
You raised their children when they were young, and you're still raising them now, which means you're spoiling them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what should I do?
There are meetings every day, either with the manager, or with the director, or with the minister.
They have nice jobs, when they are asked to attend, they must be present, it's their job.
In order to be able to go out and get your work done, there are people who stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking?
Come now, may God reward you kindly.
Okay, goodbye now.
Sorry now, yeah! yeah! Abu Sakr
They called me and told me it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If that's the case, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is annoyed and exhausted from your mistreatment of him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is tired and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Let him give you the papers.
And go straight ahead to finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until noon.
Did you hear this, mother?
Will the construction of my building be delayed?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
You need to finish your papers tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he needs to be present.
What's wrong, Uncle?
Struggling to hold back tears
In fact, I didn't lie to my parents.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they'd come on the weekend.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh father, don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those girls.
You tricked him.
Enough is enough.
I'm going to apologize.
I will do it.
Many thanks
Oh father, Khalud...
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he knew the committee wouldn't come.
We are blessed by you.
From now on, my father!
We do our personal things alone.
Stayed at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Oh, my dear father!
The whole world is worth it to me.
I don't want my father to be sad.
No bother.
As I told you,
After you finish this snippet
I would have really liked to do it myself.
He asked me to come quickly.
Since I have a meeting
With the happiness of the minister
Sorry, it's my duty.
Meeting important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with this one or that one.
Don't worry, go to your work (singing)
Where is Abu Saeed?
Well done, dad.
The envelope is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Just send it over with the tea boy when he passes by me.
My dear father
Do you mean it didn't happen?
It is possible to forget.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome.
Uh, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He's taking a week off and going to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He is enjoying himself there immensely.
And guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
And you go to him.
Goodbye
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong, Uncle?
May God guide you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, there's nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers to
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them puzzled.
Thank you, sister.
You're right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
Sorry, sister.
They call them leagues and cups.
Talk about the rules of the game.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him the title "Judge of Corruption."
People started inciting him.
And give him a few lines to say on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Whether you believe it or not, sister,
These days, everyone is only concerned with themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never, ever do that.
Let him speak, and say his famous quote: "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your presence.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Present, Mother.
I will never call.
No radio, no TV, and I won't call for help.
Your sister Ayesha was...
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
May God have mercy on you, and may God have mercy on your parents.
As you said.
Stop wasting time.
Because I don't want my father to be sad.
Your aunt, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
It's going to be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he's going to drag you to court to divorce his daughter.
Present, Mother.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I won't.
Sorry, I must go now.
"I'll tell you, but keep it a secret."
The manager told me that...
You shouldn't work here.
Because you might be talking about management.
And we started getting into trouble.
How will the manager justify this decision?
He has a million excuses to say.
Where are you going!
Grandpa, resign!
What did I tell you a moment ago?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, just once, tell us "Stop corruption."
This is wonderful
Stop corruption.
True, yes.
You're still here!
We have something to do.
This is a disaster.
Until this case is solved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they're firing him.
And Mona was standing here and heard me say this.
I did it for my parents.
I heard them say it with my own ears.
Please go, let me speak to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he got fired from his job.
Just because we're relatives,
You hear this.
Calm down.
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
"May God guide you to the right path."
I came to drink coffee.
I know you.
I'm bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to God, he will take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if we go outside,
Why do you want to get yourself into trouble?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the corruption fighter?
Oh, dear, he
It seems he doesn't want to talk these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, it's fine.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mom, you didn't understand.
I asked him to talk about my cousin's problem on his radio show.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we spoke to him in front of people.
So I said to my cousin, "Why don't we go to his house and talk to him alone?"
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
Walk away.
Enough, enough, enough
I'm going to be upset and I'll never talk to you again, you hear?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've gotten rid of this habit, praise be to God.
You have a strong sense of responsibility.
Ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
You didn't need to come.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Falcon, what's wrong with you?
I didn't recognize him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh's fight against corruption?
Are you Saleh, known for fighting corruption?
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
No open positions, you know?
You did a great job.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I've been everywhere, Manira.
Not even one of them told me that there was an empty spot five minutes before I arrived, but they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
The minister flatters.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
I fear this man will take my place.
Enough, stop that.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want my father to succeed in some way that affects me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
They're going to kill him.
But how?
I know him.
Is this the one who talks nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring him to your house.
And I'll just give him the information.
You are loyal, patriotic and... (the rest of the sentence depends on the context)
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
By God, I left her.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke with him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard his voice saying, 'Stop corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is normal, Saleh.
I am toiling in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your kind words
Your radio talk is better.
Let's hear the end of corruption, even if just once.
Yeah, God willing, just one, he says, "Abu Fahd, listen, listen, hear him out."
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want to stop.
I can't.
And then get out.
Although I want you to continue solving people's issues and problems.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, by God.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't you understand?
Please wait for my brother.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
A jar containing a quantity of poison equal to the pressure of 210 cm = pressure
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
"Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Saleh, stop corruption."
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
God willing, you will hear it.
Stop corruption... Stop the final corruption
You know.
Necessity forced him to do that.
This is the last one.
Sultan was expelled.
Was he dismissed by the minister immediately?
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bu Fahad can do what he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Your Excellency.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was the last, certainly, I won't do it again.
And this is my job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he's afraid the day will come.
And exposes his evil deeds.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They fear you.
They deceived me, my sister Aisha.
You're kind.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are fools.
These are resentful, they hate our country.
Do we have problems?
We don't have any connections.
I haven't heard that word before.
In our government departments,
We don't have any bribes.
We don't know her.
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem is what family you belong to, we don't have those kinds of problems at all.
If a manager or supervisor gets upset with you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Free of any problems
Many thanks
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Oh mother, I want candy.
No candy until dinner.
Means, no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, we were playing, Adel and I.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
May God protect you, Adoul.
Come see what your mischievous nephew did.
If I told you it was expensive, and we didn't need to buy it, you said it didn't matter, it would look nice on our son.
See what he did.
The shirt isn't worn now.
This is why he's not afraid, no one stops him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how he intends to tear it apart, it's clear he's doing it on purpose.
Poor Waleed
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
Bishop
Where is the bathroom?
In the garden.
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Be ashamed a little.
Don't argue with a child.
You shouldn't let the child do what he wants.
This is not repaired.
Don't ask me to watch my language.
Are you a repairman?
We raise them.
Act like a normal person.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay away from this, mother.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
This is a child.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
You know.
What is your fault?
Let's go upstairs.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
One doesn't become.
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm coming, goodbye, goodbye.
But, Sir, some papers require your signature, the minister wants to see them.
Alright, alright, I'll talk to the minister, don't bother yourself.
I saw the disaster, the calamity?
New, no oh! Aisha
This is not childish behavior.
You're right.
Ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adol's pants, they can cover one leg, and the other remains exposed.
It's clear that it wasn't torn by hands.
It appears to have been cut using a power saw.
All I can say is, "May God protect us all."
I'm telling you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I still know
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike,
Also because there is something else.
Telling the truth is right.
Alright, do you want some candy?
Hey, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors that can cut even a car.
Under the bed, take all the sweets.
Not to that extent.
No one else can do something like that.
Why do we have to be quiet?
The most important thing
We insist on our statement.
Who tore the clothes? It was Waleed, a child.
Which computer?
What's it about?
Those cracks are impossible for a child to have made.
Why don't you believe me?
Go around your friends.
Give me a second.
You're always like this.
He fights every day, my son!
The past days
I ask Allah for forgiveness and well-being.
"May God guide you."
Who can hold scissors this size?
Go and find friends.
Oh mother, she's a big liar.
He went and brought this big pair of scissors.
Peace be upon you, O Sultans, soon.
Come and find a solution to this, come my son!
How did I start?
Each one of you
You are parents.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and stick together.
Okay, tell me, what are you going to do now?
So what, I tore their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information; he ruined everything.
I won't leave him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, like that spoken in museums.
Ignore him.
He'll keep trying until he gets tired and gives up.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
You greeted each other.
Full of hatred and envy.
He's angry because I broke the computer.
Ah, Fahd.
Solan, hit him, hit, hit.
Fear God, O children!
Hit him, hit him, [be quiet] be careful, [be quiet]
Take your cousins and play outside with them.
"May God guide you."
May God protect you.
Old men.
What did you leave for the kids?
Okay, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
One last time, my son!
You know it's the older brother, oh! Girls
He knows how to talk to people.
And they argued.
Don't be angry with me.
You're supposed to... (complete the sentence)
Played a role
"May God guide you."
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you tell me to stay away.
Go away.
There's blood coming from my son.
Shame on you, boys!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him it was kids, he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones and, because he was far away, he thought they were adults.
I'm crazy.
You can go.
I might be tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing stones?
They %pw
Oh, dear!
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed an undertaking. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, oh Allah
God protects him from evil.
Oh my God, mother!
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, they just act like children, sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going into a coma, I'm dying.
Yeah, it's not the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he doesn't take his eyes off you.
I'm enrolled in the business class.
But he has been attending class with us for a week.
It's clear he's dying to meet you.
Don't be too demanding since he loves you this much.
No, my sister.
What my father thinks is that I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it simple.
Now he's running after you, dying to know you.
It's true that I still love him.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She looks at you and *
What are you waiting for her to come and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Take the initiative.
You're right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, miss.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they never get to know each other.
You are very old.
It means you have to go and say "Sorry."
Can we get to know you?
Not to this extent.
I need to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, by God.
Never forget us.
As long as I'm free.
Buying the villa located behind our villa for Wael.
For tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
There's no use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
Hello, hello, dad, good morning
Shift to neutral, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is running now, come on, I'll take you.
Peace be upon them, and the mercy and blessings of God.
What do you want?
The neighbours are talking to each other, what do you want?
You'd better leave us alone.
The neighbors are talking to each other, you're a stranger to them.
The gentleman parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
I mean, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic atmosphere.
See you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know you're Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely when they hear your father's name, many people will say you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
Eat cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Ah, yes.
My friend at the university, you know them, she told me that.
He loves acting and only watches his own works.
He finally said, "We live next to a famous and valuable person in the community."
My heart, what a happiness
He is very kind, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him.
It was said that he
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Oh mother, talk to my cousin Aboud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
Lucky you, he got you a sheep, a gift for the new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, any news?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, "May God bless you, Abu Saad, that my name is on the list."
It will be determined according to the need and experience of the employees.
We don't know.
We might not move you.
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God blesses us with money, we will buy furniture.
I did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbours to each other (are like) family.
But now I heard and saw her.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Don't worry, sister.
When you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan. If approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like a family now.
Can't your sister study without your help?
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Should I lie and say he was my friend?
Oh my son! Oh Ali!
I have no objection.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
Let me suggest my cousin to you.
Leave it to me.
As you like it.
They reject you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
What's wrong with Bouali?
Oh no! My brother broke the car.
From time to time, this bothers me.
My daughter, may God bless you, has a lecture.
And this car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
Don't worry.
No need to trouble yourself, my brother Rashid.
No, may God protect you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the development bank bought you a house and a car.
This is not our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see that relationships are evolving.
We discuss matters of mutual interest.
Oh my God, this is a huge development.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, Mom, this embarrasses me.
I agreed.
She said, "Noura is like my daughter, and the driver will take her to university every day."
I told her my dad's car would be under maintenance for a week.
I swear to God, no.
She said the driver would pick her up every morning.
"God is witness, O Mother of Ali!"
These are good people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
Oh the trouble, oh the trouble, what am I going to do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who's going to drive my daughter to university?
Welcome, O Ali, since you were sent by Mr. Rashid Abdullah.
We can't refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Bu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, Abu Saad!
They love you, God willing.
This is sweet.
Guys, Professor Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Sir Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem.
Lucky you, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, and I'll get it for you.
What happened? What's wrong with you? Why are you dragging me?
Are you going to propose to Manal?
Agree, mother, agree.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Dresses too, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
I hope Waleed gets married soon, the light of my eyes.
She called me, poor thing.
Take some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You're leaving by a fancy car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
Inshallah, I can't see you.
This is a great kindness from Waleed's mother.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I go with you like this, they won't believe that this feeble man is the husband of that queen.
Oh my God
Will you go in these clothes?
Oh, shepherd! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
Without my shape, you won't recognize me.
They're surprised when they find out I'm a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may God prolong his life.
By God, I didn't recognize you, I thought you were one of the notables, not Abu Ali, you are not Abu Ali.
What do you think?
Even your walk is different.
May God bless you, the people we suggest to Ali because of them.
They are important figures.
I arranged everything from a horse bridle to a car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series I acted in
There was an event, as I remember, a wedding.
You were wearing a shiny black bisht.
And my father taught me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I've never worn a bisht in my life.
Inshallah, you look wonderful.
Like this, even when you enter the guest room.
This is not correct.
My brother Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
The one who is always with me and with Khaled.
That's why.
You are my little girl.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to leave us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife.
We are blessed by this.
I'll tell her father, and God willing, he will ease our situation with what is best for us.
Why did they reject him, on what basis?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, man!
I'm crying from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
In return, I act honestly.
I act on stage for a few hours and my role ends.
When the acting is over.
You play roles.
I act.
I convey a useful vision.
But you
I wear costumes for role-playing.
On the stage
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The role of the rich and wealthy woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
This is a scandal.
You missed the view.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head," poor thing, it broke my heart.
And he walked straight.
Exactly like a horse.
It's Thursday, man, Thursday!
This is Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
He doesn't even look at women, and a woman can't see him.
See how his wife slaughters him from vein to vein.
Stretch it, don't turn your face away.
I'll expose him in the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please, show them the shape of the city center.
Thursday, show me the shape of the city center.
Does your wife call it downtown?
Come on, Thursday
I'm going to see what Salem wants.
Poor him.
When will you change!
If you only hear what they say about you
Even my elders say more than that.
Why are you doing this?
She is jealous of the women around me.
Why are you so jealous?
When I sometimes sit in front of the TV
She, she
I swear by God.
No, no, perfect.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
See that.
I spoke with her a moment ago, in front of you. She heard a man's voice.
By God, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Show a little self-respect and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
What's on your mind!
There's nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're spending time with these empty-headed people.
Especially this fat one, he's the one I hate the most among your friends.
He has chubby cheeks and his hair is like a child's plant.
This is rude, no shame.
You want to torment me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, how are you?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Salim, what's wrong! What happened!
Our friend Khamis has gone crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Burst out laughing
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and imagines talking to her.
God protects his wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He's busy right now, he's on an international call, very far away, even the signal is weak.
What does the message say?
Good health to you, Thursday!
Why are you awake!
I'm sleepless, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they?
May God guide you, Khamees.
These names were selected by the Office of the Minister.
Come on, let's go
Why are you afraid of her?
If you're talking to Salem, why are you hinting at him?!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Like this
I saw the last caller's number, read it, you have it.
The last number!
I pressed the last number after I deleted the number of the woman I was talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salam.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do I need to call?
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, give me the password, a pen, a call, I'll give you the number.
Help each other.
Oh men, always like this.
You're a liar just like him, I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
Cursed me
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is very brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
This is my problem. I listened to your advice and called her.
Listen, Thursday.
Did she suspect me in the minister's office?
Come with me and tell the whole truth, stay away from this matter.
This is what he has to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled **our day**
Where is Thursday?
Jay.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Alright, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
Meeting at 1 PM
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, who has been living with you since that day?
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And from that day on, his status did not change.
Jealous, jealous of the presence of women around him.
This is not envy.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Her mother is dead.
This is why I called myself, to find a solution for me.
I asked you to move to the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look, the signature is clear at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've moved to the social welfare department.
ICU! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you Madame, I mean Monsieur Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Did you go to the new department?
Who's in the office with you?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Oh Thursday! The minister decided to transfer you yesterday only.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
It means I have to go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will be back in a month and a half.
A big problem ahead.
If you want my opinion,
The minister is telling you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time they transferred you because many people talked to him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
What can we do!
Don't talk when your wife calls you.
You never know, they might agree with you. Beg them.
I asked them to leave the abayas in the car, I put them in a carton for you.
How many?
I put ten, just like you five are in the office, meaning two for each one.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine if he gave all of us male names.
And Abdelkader tells me
What's his name?
He is sweet and charming, that's why she is afraid another girl might like him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with it?
Who called me?
Ah, Abdelkader, who sits next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, each one can choose the one she likes.
Look at this, this one.
How much is this?
What's wrong? What happened?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office located?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I am crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
I opened the project before us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
"Munaur, make some tea."
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, go make us some tea.
Move, move, nonsense.
Go, listen to what the men are saying.
Don't forget we're Scorpions.
Go, go and bring me tea without sugar, go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project was good.
I called him many times, his phone is busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you for a while.
These are my brothers as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled for three months, and hasn't shown up.
Farewell, O Generous God.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour for us.
Ah, but if you build a garden
It takes up the space of two or three villas at least.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put down the tea and walk.
There's nothing in the garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, to kill yourself?
Saw, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessings.
Ah, Uncle Shahin is here.
Inshallah
Is it Thursday?
Grew up and became an adult.
She came of age.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
You know,
Leave the topic of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Set it aside.
I have a few comments on his suggestions.
Okay, may God grant you a long life.
Is there something else?
No, may God grant you a long life.
Take care of them, and I'll meet them when I have time.
What did you do with the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's wrong with you?
I'm leaving now, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
And we suffered at their hands.
Do you know they asked me about what you play at school?
I told them to play ping-pong.
They should have killed you.
This was just the beginning.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what it means?
This time we've had enough of your attitude.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Uncle, let me slap her.
This is enough.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted to study architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman can't work on the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You're embarrassing us, brother.
Let me break her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Sure, President Scorpion.
You just defeated Fatima.
Let your brother try his luck, Falcon.
This is a flaw.
"It's okay, Darkin. At least you got a slap in the face."
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And write "education" instead.
Or even nursing, we have no objection.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
So you know that we're open to new ideas.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Leave her and walk away.
Bring us a copy of the request.
Go away, get lost.
Leader of the scorpions, my son!
The very scorpion suggested it to you.
Thank you, Uncle, but when is the engagement?
Miss Manira
What you ask is difficult.
I wish I could travel, Abu Khalid!
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How do they allow you to work then!
That's why they're not saying anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is bullshit.
No shame!
You should be grateful that we allow you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them I can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and be quiet.
Thursday, son of Scorpions
He is close to us.
This is true, he's stupid and he doesn't have a degree.
But it's a scorpion.
What will you do, sister?
What should I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
God willing, I will talk to you depending on when the sheikh arrives.
A very sweet laugh.
Go buy new clothes.
Go get yourself a new dress, my son.
I love this laughter.
Oh brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
Lucky you, Aisha. You're the minister's friend now.
I'm afraid it's a rumor, Abu Khalid!
Muna is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry in the new cabinet structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
Inshallah it's not a rumor.
Will you go to work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Highness
Thank you = Happiness
Thank you.
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's play.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, brothers!
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
You're going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister will play an important game.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
You're going to study architecture.
There's no difference between "rail" and "once".
Seriously? Go make coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, kiss your mother and tell her you've been expelled from school.
Go, *
What a fool!
The coffee in the pot you have has gotten cold.
They call all year round, but when they know you have a series, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her to join us in the series.
Sure, she'll be the main heroine.
Look, Ali, Sha'ula is playing the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is limited to twenty-six or seven episodes.
Let Shoula benefit.
He gives us never-ending lectures.
I'm afraid we'll get a headache.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know your production company, you and Hamad.
God willing, I won't be late.
And Rashid is here too.
The manager and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, let's start the meeting, folks.
Please tell us your opinion.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think she's the best.
You see why the maid committed suicide.
You know the most impactful part for me.
It was after the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
She found him and screamed at her son, "He's crazy!"
And he kept kicking him until he reached the yard of the house.
Excitement
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
This is a really great series.
I was about to run the series here on this table.
In fact, it's artistic blackmail.
My community
All of them are about extraordinary events.
This is unreasonable.
Seventy-seven cases of murder.
What's wrong with crying?
You are known for holding people up.
Okay, Professor Hamad, let's be a bit open-minded.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, this doesn't work with a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
He was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Madame Hessa?" and I replied, "Yes."
I opened the bag.
It was a ring worth about seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian brought these things by mistake.
No, it's not a mistake.
She is tanned.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Ah, this is for you.
The ring is very luxurious.
I never dreamed of owning a ring like this.
May God bless you, dear Hessa.
Ah, that's it, I call it the series of blessings.
Ali and Hamad own the production but they are employees there, they cannot present it under their names.
What else will we take besides the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your shining husband
The one who is called the magician.
Only five percent, that's little.
No, that's fine if they agree to four million for them.
Your husband will have 200,000 riyals, right?
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada.
A great role, loving a man and escaping on a bicycle.
The series we will produce is called Blackmail of Conscience.
Talk to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf series are always like that, this year's trend is blackmail.
Okay, tell me, brave one, what's my role?
You too, my love, your turn is guaranteed.
Don't shame me.
Jay, Jay, now
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect us
He never asks to see me at this time of day.
And I told him it was going to be a weak and stupid series.
Don't waste your money on her.
Okay, so, what happened next?
God forbid, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid said something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
Social series
I saw her on TV.
No, I seek refuge in Allah from longevity.
The series on TV now is called "Blackmailing the Flower of Youth."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
Requires a high budget
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need to support her.
Don't worry.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they've started filming the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
And a huge budget is allocated to it.
However, it was said that the series was weak.
Others said the series consisted of a school that taught moral corruption.
It's possible they'll stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
Hello, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I'm Monir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if that's not a bother.
Yeah, okay, please sit for a bit, because there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will enable us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will contact all the correspondents in the world to get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
He discusses issues in a way that classifies him as the best output in the history of the world.
Believe it or not, who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have such a journalist?
Do we have such a journalist?
A journalist must have a moral sense.
They are working.
You think they're here to *
I met the Minister, guess what he told me?
It's very tragic and the events are extraordinary.
The first episode is tomorrow, I'm going to watch it with people.
What do you think, mama?
It's okay, Mom, just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Similarly, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your series?
My son, art is a skill, not a strange thing to generalize to people and society.
Oh Mother, this can be done in art education, but theatrical acting is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our kids see this.
Not to that extent, brother.
In worse TV series.
In fact, no one.
This is your doing.
For everyone, in every home.
Go and find people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And show it to them.
It's ours.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How does the minister like it?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote this.
I only publish messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow, and I'll publish praise messages from me, claiming that viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You are happy.
For this year
Alright, if they have an agreement with him.
This is the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They all agree with them.
Alright, let's say they all have an agreement with them.
I'm reading the translation only.
I wish they would rerun the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I wish they would do it again.
When the minister's office first called me
It means we can come to pick up the final installment of money from the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
This wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding and we got our money.
The series is also a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose a second part to the series.
The minister believed the press trick that was fabricated.
Believed the imaginary success we made.
He's not happy with the series.
This means it's impossible for him to agree to a second term.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can't help it.
Say "thank you"
For all people
Who worked on this series?
Congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards from distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
This is what you believe.
You are a genius.
He won the gold prize for sure.
And what was he saying?
He said, "If the readers and the press lie to me."
Yeah, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are artistic whitewashes.
Money laundering!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Illegal money
The series are similar.
What can't we do with "one, two"?
What do you mean?
Didn't we sign a contract with them? They need to comply.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and diverse.
How much did we agree upon in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Did anyone tell you about his product?
No, by God, they just told me this is bread, but I don't know its ingredients.
This is Zibib bread.
Soustha
Instead of cutting the bread, call it "samon" as you call it.
The inventor tried to simplify it.
Genise bread
This is the secret.
Eat bread with the zipper.
People do very strange things.
This zipper is amazing, it's made in such a way that as soon as you put it in your mouth, it dissolves.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Enter, Sameh.
Yes, by God, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
Sir, we delivered it today.
Tell him: Oh! Forgive me.
I was with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
And also our team is incomplete, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I should have fans too.
When I took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
The important people in the company.
Those we can't do without.
Take over the hospital bakery.
Why are you bothering the boy?
I said he can't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and laugh at himself.
He can do what he wants.
But do not take the necessities.
What should I do, Mom? We have a team match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, what's done is done.
Hamdi hasn't shown up for work today, sir.
I went with him.
Put on your clothes.
And leave me standing in the goal area.
The match started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Have you ever been a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
We're tired of your love for football.
Right now, Nasser!
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, this is it.
I don't want to hear anything.
Sorry, Abu Nasser!
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, I'll do it, just because you asked me to.
Speak, and what did you want to say?
Tomorrow we'll play the last match in the tournament.
Don't bother him, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations
Zina, Zina, Zina, Congratulations
Oh, Mr. Nasser! I'd like to speak with you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we are compelled to...
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
And they invited the press and journalists to come there.
No oh! We'll take Rashid to our house.
Even when my father sees the players and their success, he doesn't cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
Inshallah
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Keep it close to me.
Take a good picture.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's victory, the bakers, made them win.
Fun and full of vitality
And the effort
Loyalty to the bakery.
Excuse me, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the baker's plan and the coach.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
May God protect you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
Al-Duwairi and Al-Jazeera = Journalists are coming to interview you.
No, they are not from the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Well, goodbye.
Inshallah your phone doesn't stop ringing, and your pictures are in the newspapers. Congratulations on this ball.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He lowered the price of the engines, said okay.
Yeah, you've become famous now. Under every picture of you in the newspapers, they write: "First female athlete in international baking."
Were you interested in soccer?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say you weren't close to football.
Since the person next to me is playing football, I am close to the ball.
Proximity to sports means that I am an athlete.
We are no longer the International Bakery, we are the International Football.
I heard him say yesterday that he would make it a sports club.
And today we meet with the first athlete in the international bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To improve football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before you go on stage.
The match is tough today.
The team that controls the midfield will be ... today.
By God, hopefully we will communicate with professional player agents to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud, listen, we want a commitment.
Yeah, he wants the previous deal for the players.
What's the use?
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
So, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is not your job.
Just let me know when a buyer from the Gulf arrives.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a center player.
Look, these are the four players.
Three of them cost.
Ten thousand dollars for the player.
Take them all in one bunch.
The amount becomes six hundred thousand, I still want to give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Sweet, this is about African players, now, about the Brazilian player.
He is the player of the season, he alone is worth a million and two thousand dollars.
They gave me this price, and then I received a fax. I'll show it to you, it's right here. Wait, look, look, I got it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Many thanks
God willing, he will lose his leg from below.
How are you?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want any injuries, God willing, no cruciate ligament tears.
Hey! Abu Nasser
What is this connecting muscle?
Butcher! Make a "mufattah" (rice and meat, a traditional dish).
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the shop, the shop.
Ah, God willing, you have another business.
No, no, no, just the players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the forests of Africa.
Ah, why?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being just like us.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear it?"
He said they are young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, he will be beneficial to you in the future.
Then they went and released him in the stadium.
Come, come, come, come
Don't be too hard on him, he's still young.
Put it in the shed, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach must understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
Dad, he's the coach of Spain.
What I love
Successful coach
You must control the game.
This is one, the opposite, the Wakrah road.
We shouldn't let your coach do what he wants.
He stayed with the team for less than two months.
We need to finish this matter.
If he were an expert in football, he would activate the wing players and not attack from the center.
Ah, rely on the offside trap.
Oh, Mom, don't give me a headache.
He must expel Kakno Malawi.
Replace it with Shinamoo Hababo Hitawala Hatawa Hawawa.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget about Shlulu's pills, they're useless.
What line?
Execute the plan.
And he forgot his joy.
This is what was supposed to happen between the coach and the team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
You mean we're not football experts?
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery car, let him go by taxi.
None of your business.
Stay informed
Do you think what my father did was fair?
The coach was fired and sent packing.
What's he doing?
The team is destroying.
Tell our team goodbye.
Oh my God, mother!
No, he's crazy. That means he said you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the very first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this young man.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talking about the past.
You should go to his father and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say, oh! Rashid.
For what reason did he divorce her then?
This can't be, Abu Abdullah! We need to know, it's our right to know, why it was launched?
Come on, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
How, how can I interfere? The man is waiting in the hall, does he know why his daughter is divorced?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
What's your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not six.
This is Guardiola's team.
It means that I'm going to meet the man who's waiting for me in the lobby now.
If you go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
She goes out without looking back.
She's done enough to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the magician of the ball, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your daughter, who has no shame, mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter doesn't support Barcelona and doesn't fit us (as an example).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
To apologize and make amends.
May God curse you.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if it doesn't make our son happy?
Oh, enough.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not mad.
She's crazy, my son, forget about her.
Drink your tea, my son!
You know, son, they are the ones who lose.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Poor thing, she got divorced two days ago.
One month after marriage.
Why do you want me to interfere with him?
I don't want to mess with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Do you know who he is?
And what else do you want!
Just her luck.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and convert into a hotel apartment?
Those in Mansoura.
His father owns it, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If I can.
Spoke with her brother.
Listen well,
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain so they can spend every summer there.
Okay, what about the Barcelona story?
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
Do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they called him Abu Burjeen because he had two towers on the corniche.
Design them in an odd way, like intertwined ropes.
When people see them from a distance, they think it's a single tower.
What do you think? All the luck is with you.
Welcome %pw
God bless you. Okay, take something, take everything.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me, my dear son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry about Nour, my dear Abd Allah's mother.
If I searched all the Gulf countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
They are to give us their estimates for building the structure.
I'm done, sir. Anything else?
Yeah, the family knows how to reach you.
Look into their marriage needs, prepare the check and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God willed it, in the name of God, God willed it, with your permission, my lord.
Abdullah is divorced again!
I wish for children from you and money from him.
God bless you, auntie.
He's wearing it because of the cold.
Ah, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Where did you book us, Mama?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia? I hope everything is okay.
Have a safe trip.
What's wrong with you? Did you hear someone coming back from their honeymoon shouting?
What's wrong with you, my daughter? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Oh mother, she is so arrogant.
Why?
She's arrogant, forget about her.
You did the right thing when you let her go.
I feel sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
May God bless you, don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Alright.
My mother says she booked us to the Maldives.
Okay, okay! The Maldives are still beautiful.
And also bless you.
I thought you'd come back happy from your trip.
What gets me is why he took the kids?
Come take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, light of my eye?
Shut up! God bless you, you're going to tell me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you sad?
When I see the scales, I'll get depressed.
May the one who bothers you die, my son.
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Shut up, and I know my son has something small bothering him, why is he living miserably!
Oh my son, call her and divorce her.
May God curse her.
Say it to her three times.
You're divorced. Wait, don't hang up, stay for two more minutes.
Divorced, divorced.
Very nervous.
Oh my God! Oh son, relax, my dear, and don't worry. There are plenty of girls, as they say. Oh my God! Oh son.
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
What's my mother's name? Divorce me already, he told me, "You are divorced, divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you? He has no shame.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will they do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong! The world has gone crazy!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and scold him, and he won't know who you are.
I, I, my daughter is divorced, O Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
Just as you feel the bitter taste in your mouth right now because of your daughter and you are discouraged.
And they did nothing.
%pw is what brought you the apple peeled, divorce her.
No problem, you can release them however you want.
She is still married to a man.
It's fine with you, let him go to hell!
I feel the same as I did to others.
What you do not accept for yourselves.
Do not accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land this mall is on?
In a strategic location?
Just leave it to God.
And at a ridiculous price, too.
Out of service.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
By God, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow I'm free, and the problem is I need to get Abu Saqr's approval, I need it.
He's the life of the party.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, God forbid, is the office, not the home.
Do you eat like that too?
And what makes Abu Saqr full?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd!
Do you know him?
What I know, I only see him on TV, and you told me that you meet him during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Let's get rid of this nonsense.
God guides you, you came straight away, at least ask about the reason for this party.
There's no occasion for this, God forbid.
The month is thirty days long, and he hosts fifty feasts.
I suggest, Your Honor, that you be put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the largest banquet maker in the world.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
Honor us, Your Honor.
Oh, farmer!
She says Abu Saqr throws a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But Abu Flah! Tonight's feast is for a special occasion.
Today, God willing, He protects you, your son Falcon.
God bless you, you deserve it, good luck.
He is here, welcome my son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Saqr must go to the agency tomorrow and pick up the car he wants.
I waited for approval for a year and a half.
I was out of the trade.
But when I reached him.
And I give him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things aren't going to work this way.
I told him it's okay.
He is to visit the exhibition and choose the car he likes.
We buy three for him.
Take it to him!
They took me to him.
You told me that you met him during the Umrah last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
He deserves to be well, Your Honor.
Oh, Falcon of Abu Sukkar.
May God bless you, thank you, people of Qatar.
Praise be to God that Falcon is well, Your Honor.
God bless you
By the way, who are you?
My lady judge
You don't know me.
I can't lie to you (like that).
My lord, I went on Umrah with you last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Fahad, are you still undecided about entering the business field or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
Why, son of Falcon, trade is beautiful.
You should start, open an office and then see.
Abu Sakr,
Madam, please say yes.
Why?
I have a small gift.
Full floor
And if trade loves you and is coming to you, you say no.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Since you got your license, everything has come easily to you—a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz told your father that if he wanted to join us in the business as a partner with a 50% share, he would be welcome.
Oh my god, how can I balance business and university?
Oh mother, don't make me do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are being thrown at you for free.
This is an opportunity, my son! Who can start a business at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, [son], this is the opportunity of your life.
Roz prepares lunch quickly.
He also reached for the pickles and pepper.
"He didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa business."
Waldo has a sweet tooth for business.
This is what I was eager to see. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
May God protect him from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan told me yesterday, "Your son has just started in business."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a partner in two banks.
I'm sorry.
I think, Allah knows best, they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, the one in the northern area of our office, what's in it?
No, but I love her.
Thank you very much and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
May God bless you all.
There's no use regretting now.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of suffering and hard work to get the supermarket ready.
What's wrong with you! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me this is Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, who wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
He also wants to be your partner?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
You started talking to him, right?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I told you it's business!
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian bakery?
As we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on the sign? What name was written on the sign?
It said "Neighborhood Bakery".
No, I want a different name.
"Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon him."
Hey, how's work going?
Very well, Your Honor, God willing, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will finish the drawings for the Future Company's worker housing.
No, no, Sir Sakr is my wife Elisa, let me introduce you to Mr. Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, one person says he wants to work in the field of trade; he has a little money and wants to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study in economics, or even business.
One like this
Do you think he'll succeed? I don't think so, he's wasting his time and losing.
Listen up, Abu Nasser!
I heard what those two were saying.
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
See him.
See it today.
Your Honor, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son is a falcon, God willing, and I don't want to envy him, exceptionally.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, my son Falcon builds himself alone.
Once, he gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
"And whatever Allah wills, behold it now."
Oh Falcon! We are talking about ordinary people,
One of them is a falcon, and that's what Abu Nasser did to it. He took it and put it on the road.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We should ask who his father is.
By God, I am surprised.
God willing.
Gulf Funds Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Please come in.
Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome Salim.
What's wrong?
I swear to God, I don't know what to say, Salem.
By God, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
Poor thing, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
He showed him much kindness.
As they say, "I taught him archery, and when his arm grew strong, he shot me" (a popular proverb).
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, Salim.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without his left hand knowing what his right hand does.
Donations from this organization are distributed to all Muslims across Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Al-Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we are now also supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of no more than one hundred and thirty-two riyals only.
We don't lag behind.
Then we'll come to you right away.
Who is this beloved?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yeah, anywhere I am with you, I'm happy.
My love, may God keep you for me - Qatari dialect
Ah! My love.
This isn't fair. It's my livelihood.
This bakery
And take the money from your account.
Five real beans, three real hot bread.
Two chickpeas.
Five beans, perfect, perfect.
Cook six broad green beans!
Come on, divers!
The captain is here and brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Pardon me, Your Honor!
And what does that mean?
No, no. The thing I'm asking you for is to hear the word "yes" ringing in my ear.
Hello Nora.
Enoud is mad at you.
Can I bear your anger?
So, what's the story?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a plain and simple dress.
Don't say Anoud will get upset.
Goodness, these Lebanese speak fluently.
And you should not talk to him much.
I'm still jealous of her.
The best dress for the most beautiful flower.
He flirts with her by calling her "Noara."
Let your blood boil, will it take long?
I paid twenty thousand and have twenty thousand riyals left.
Keep up the good work, congratulations!
God be with you.
Hello, Mrs. Saleh.
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to keep you.
I'm at your service (proverb).
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I got it, oh! You fool.
Did you like the joke?
I mean, did you bring the design with you?
I don't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
Let them leave, envy starts working.
When he realizes that my project is good and starts generating income,
They say he will carry out a project like mine.
Design and Sewing Operator
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser, he has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He is harming his cousin.
That's the way it is these days.
Hey, what's up, bro?
You know I was sleeping and they woke me up and told me your cousin wants you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
Inshallah.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like.
Are you looking for a partner or something?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I might drop by.
Excuse me.
If you need more, we've got it.
Praise be to God, the work is going well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh!
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
By God, they did it.
Okay, God willing, goodbye.
That's it, then.
Sure?
And with haute couture, you know the big disaster!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You're jealous! (Ad) You're envious!
Before you knew the market was open to everyone,
You should know.
May your heart be open to your cousin.
I'm here to ask you,
You deny, lie, and mock me, and you told me, me,
I wanted to do my work in secret.
In order to get this from the shop next to us, you want to ruin my business.
But they didn't say come and become like a pain in the neck next to the wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. By God, I'll slap you. This is hatred. Leave me alone with him.
Come on, are you relatives or what?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, I swear I'll hit you! With your terrible voices.
I'll hit you just as you hit me and stole my stuff.
Come on, people!
Just say peace be upon him, people!
I swear, I swear, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why specifically the Lebanese?
They exchange chatter, jokes, laughter, and feel very comfortable.
This is why Abu Saleh speaks Lebanese.
He started saying sweet things to me and convincing me.
He bewitched me, he bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me and I was convinced to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
And make money.
A Lebanese designer bag.
Can I meet with Mr.? You told me yesterday it was difficult, is it still difficult today?
Yeah, today was really tough.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed in these days.
What's wrong?
Don't I know? What's the problem?
Abu Saleh is mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar. No Qatari opens a shop without another Qatari coming and doing the same project and opening the same shop next to him. Can I go into it?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now, they're thinking of a solution.
What do we do now?
We sit as if we had eaten poison.
If we stay like this, I think we won't even make the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we'll be giving them a free rein.
Okay, thank you. How much is your discount?
"It's not possible. Why don't you give away an evening gown with every wedding dress for free?"
No room for hesitation, let's go.
What's wrong? What's happening? We're going to the store next to you, today they have an ad with every wedding dress, two evening dresses for free, and also a 25% discount.
Come on, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will release the same ad: Buy a wedding dress and get two evening gowns free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm also thinking the same thing, if we leave them, they will ruin us.
Don't bother.
What did he do next?
The subject is an absolute challenge.
Of course it's a challenge.
Strange, this troublemaker deserves it; he doesn't want anyone to earn their living.
If he hears news within two or three days, he'll close his shop.
You did well.
Wait, wait, hang up the phone, hang up the phone, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's wrong with you?
Saad says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit there, and he doesn't know where the foul smell is coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, it's impossible.
The smell in the shop won't go away for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cut the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this justice?
Now do you expect a pledge, or do we file a lawsuit and open a case?
Don't do anything for him.
He ended his life from this world.
Oh, Abu Nasser! Something strange has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, close up, close up, a customer is coming, I'll talk to you later. That's strange.
He's in bed, moaning.
He said it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and they want the installments.
His debts mounted up because of his wicked cousin.
What's been up with him lately?
Poor things, if they accidentally entered and saw Saad the designer, they would scream at his face and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he can't sleep, his eye doesn't close, he stares at the ceiling above him.
I don't know what my question is.
Saud is at the shop.
He bewitched him, I don't know what he did to him.
When the women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, what made him do that to himself!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence to be able to sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget him, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what magic you've done to him. You've turned a designer into a monster, and women are afraid of him when they see him.
Spread a rumor.
It's not possible, guys. Tell him the group needs him urgently.
Oh, please, God protect you, tell him he needs you quickly, quickly.
I swear to God, they raise my blood pressure, they kill me, they paralyze me. This is not fair, Professor Abdullah.
It's okay, my dear Ahmed. Don't be upset. You have heart disease; this is what suits you, man!
I swear to God I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but he's useless. Those add-ons will drive me crazy, they'll drive me crazy.
Don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll make you hear endless talk.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed, let's finish.
I mean, I'm going to stop filming because the extra actor didn't show up.
What is this production?
I have nothing to do with this, Mr. Abdullah. Why are you shouting at me?
My love, if anyone shouts at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
An extra actor was late and they were in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, darling.
Look for someone with authority and a strong reputation, who can convince people that it's really possible to become a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Come on, son, upload the pictures and I'll have it ready for you in half an hour.
No one, oh! Ala', no one, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll organize myself in two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What are they going to do now?
They'll do everything, see the manager, his nerves are showing and there's chaos, but they'll manage.
A person with special qualities is needed. Where can I find one now?
Grandfather?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know one, God help you with him, hopefully he will be suitable.
I cannot translate the text.
Saud Qanaz! I remember him as Saud al-Asha.
Ah, when he was little, they called him Saud al-Ashr. When he grew up a bit, they started calling him Albalb.
Why cans?
"Why, poor thing. He used to roam the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo."
My rich, esteemed brother, do not despair.
His appearance is suitable, as I recall he is plump and fat, neither tall nor stout.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do his makeup well, and I guarantee it will work out and be cute.
Okay, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and go to him.
Where was Saud's house?
And what does he say?
Shut up, shut up.
Saud Albalbishi
We don't have anyone in the neighborhood named Saud Kanz.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud, and he lives with his mother.
Yeah, that's right.
But this is not Saud Kanz.
This is Saud's laptop.
Sure, this is it, but it evolves over time because laptops are like cans.
He is tall, fat, and somewhat brown.
Cancel the cans and start collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, man!
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where's the second handkerchief? Where is it?
Eid al-Adha
This is what I'm looking for.
Fix Wax brand oil.
Oh my son, iron it a bit before you go out, it's wrinkled.
But these days, I feel worse.
Oh mother, may God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting that you take me to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they told me they would pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you are now employed instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mum, goodbye.
You fight with her, you get upset and then you make up.
You wander off by yourself with your camera, it walks beside you.
Yes. Ja'far! Yes.
My laptop?
Abu Aboud, this is a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Maai.
This is for you, and I am the son %pw, Aboud, how are you?
How are you, my servant?
Act fairly, you have to act a little fairly in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Hadi, Hadi, Hadi, Hadi, Be quiet, Be quiet.
I love acting, and I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
It's not like you think, oh my brother.
He is very sick, do you know he didn't sleep last night, brother!
"May Allah heal him, breathe, my brother."
May God heal him/her.
Your life is just a bowl of cherries (proverb).
Oh my lord! Oh my lord!
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He's a director, not a doctor.
Mind your own business, listen to what he's saying, he's talking nonsense.
What's his mother's name?
A spit on you, what do you think?
I heard what she said about you.
You say you're shallow, you should be more serious.
Give me, give him, give him, give him half a million so he can fix my car tires.
And I'll give him three million to get me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you talk like that.
Because I'm sober at the request of some people.
See, Mr. Naïve, our neighborhood's production, actors of a high level.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Excellent, I'll help you, I don't mind, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a bowl of cherries (proverb).
Take my brother to the hairdresser, do his makeup, and I'll tell Salman to bring you the suit and come to you.
Walk, walk, walk, this is nice.
Okay, okay.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, I'll call you tomorrow to pick it up.
It doesn't matter, but is there anyone who can give me a ride?
Pick you up! Okay, I'll have our driver pick you up. Alright, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the extra, call him.
Oh my God! People are calling Saud "Laptop" from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth.
It's written in front of me before.
Okay, shall we review again?
This means me!
I didn't expect this from you.
Why are we fighting?!
We're fighting for our rights.
Yeah, wait.
You should know who you're talking to, Abu Abdelaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Divorce her and be done with it.
We don't marry the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He's cleaning it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you're going to the fitting room to change your clothes, and we're ready to shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Oh no! The shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why?
I don't need tea, oh brother! I'm bored and my stomach is bloated from tea. What's this, I've been waiting for an hour, how long do I have to wait?
I didn't see anything, it's perfectly normal.
May God give you good health.
They are fast.
Thank you, Your Honor. May God protect you.
Give my regards to your people.
They say Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Alright, Your Honor %PW.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Those who resemble you, greet you and kiss your nose as well.
The first time someone kissed me on the nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose was like an ice cream stick, cutting your lips. It was funny, it was fun.
You didn't laugh!
Don't mention it.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
Oh my son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
May God bless you, Sheikh, may God bless you.
See it for yourself, man!
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
Oh my son, what happened!
Peace be upon you, what's wrong with you, Your Excellency?
Vinegar, vinegar, vinegar, vinegar
And don't tire yourself, God willing it will be, Dr. Hassan come here, come, come.
Yes, Dr. Hani, what happened?
Let your honor rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be fine.
Hello, hello sir, hello.
Shut up or I'll slap you.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Call me, sir!
How are you, sir?
May God curse you (Qatari dialect).
Yes, Your Honor.
Hello, welcome. Please have a seat.
God bless you.
You ugly bitch (Qatari dialect)
Walk with him, Mr. Rashid.
I swear to God, if I don't do something for you, tell me and see what I'll do to him.
Comrade! Can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, your turn will come.
Listen to me, you!
May I ask you, comrade?
Oh my son, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, I didn't find anyone there, they are good and accept anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, find yourself a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
But, my brother! She's ignoring me.
Just try to get close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intentions are good.
There's nothing wrong.
Act like a human being.
Or get out, get out, if you don't leave, I'll call security to teach you some manners.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
Please give it to me.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
You're marrying him, that means you're marrying him.
No, no, I need the car, the clothes, and also the money. I'll rent them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Come on, let's go.
What is this %PW Al-Marzouk!
Please, please, may God please you.
The light of my eyes signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were amazed by what I did for them; it was a very sophisticated and private event.
One regular and one diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Oh no, I promised my friends I'd be at work tomorrow.
You're taking this to them!
Ah, what's wrong?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take this matter to his friends, for the sake of embarrassing him.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Ah, but I promised them now.
I need to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go change your clothes so we can get something that will please people.
What's wrong! Let's go.
And the price is reasonable and the quality is excellent.
Above average, not the best!
Of course there's premium chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for the right price.
It's too expensive. Why are you looking for the most expensive one?
This is unbelievable, check out this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always ordered at the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations and, by the way, there is a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion, guys?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in accounting.
"By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me another one."
Hurry up with the coffee.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, dear, I attended their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Do you believe me, sister!
Did you listen to your aunts?
That's why I want to throw you an unforgettable wedding.
No time, you only have a month and a half.
I'm organizing everything.
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You live in the community, you see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw it with your own eyes.
When you buy something beautiful, you see how they praise you and admire your taste.
They told you it was imaginary and beautiful?
You're right, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate could have bought four sheep for the wedding.
Come on, don't interfere. Your mother knows how to do everything. Just give her the money and be done with it.
This means they will accept whatever we choose.
Oh, you have bad taste, frankly.
What's your opinion on this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was nice!
What's your opinion on this one?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought of creating a platform similar to a computer mouse.
Excuse me for a minute.
See, they talk about everything except the stage and the arrangements. This is the place where the women sit who have nothing to do but gossip, so just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We're going to the mouse stage.
A very strange phase.
The latest model in 2011.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit next to him, it's all for your own good.
That means you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark you have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse you pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Decide and we're ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
See for yourself, getting married in the Comoros? That's how it is in our country.
We're still at the beginning.
If you don't need a stage, where will you take the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and a little wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in reality, they are thieves.
So what's bothering you now?
Angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I'm talking to the bride's mother and telling her that Saleh has very difficult conditions.
Doesn't he want to get married? Can't he afford the wedding expenses? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much more?
One hundred seventy-two, alright then,
But I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's scandals.
Okay, booked.
Your salary is higher than mine.
We're going to have a problem we can't handle.
God help you, Saleh!
But if God guides you, you should have tried to fix things.
Alhamdulillah, I've decided to look for a wife from any Arab country.
They say there's a marriage that costs you only two thousand dollars and enjoy.
God bless you, dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You just need to specify how many cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about his interests, and don't care what people will say.
People know the standard of marriage from invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the women will say.
Look at their marriage, if these are their invitations, they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we'll order it online.
It has a cloth cover, is made of panda skin, and has a silver sheen.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be a hot topic for the ladies, we're just asking for invitations, asking for invitations!
I feel sorry for him, man.
Poor thing, of course his family put a lot of pressure on him.
Oh man! He's collecting money from everyone.
He says he even sold his car.
He looks twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, poor thing, I don't know when we will develop.
Lock the door, please.
Sorry, brother!
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
What do you mean by "based on my budget"?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our societies suffer from is the illness of showing off, boasting, and pride.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there.
Once, I hinted to the bride's mother.
She attacked me with her words (proverbs).
Trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you, my brother, decide that I should get married,
I'm thinking of marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And say your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser invited a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems you don't like what I do!
It's enough that he sold his car and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
I just entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, Mom, that's enough.
I don't care about either you or him.
I'm no less than anyone.
Don't make a fool of us.
Oh, mother, please, my brother spent all he had and borrowed from everyone.
Come on, be quiet.
My mother has new demands for the marriage, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she screamed at him and said, "I'm calling off the marriage, I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She is inside and they are administering first aid to her.
He said she was much better now and they would find a room for her in the hospital.
Shame!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you a sleeping injection.
How can I relax when he wants to joke with us for better or for worse?
I was telling him to bring us Abdullah Roaished, and he said he didn't have any money.
I feel sorry for your mother.
I'm afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her at your leisure, I'll do what you want.
I'll get you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not possible, you couldn't find anyone but Abu Yusuf.
What's wrong!
Oh Saleh! Are you crazy?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man and, moreover, he was disciplined and honest.
In my opinion, if you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Okay, done.
This is because of the financial crisis you are going through, and you want to ask Abu Youssef for money, of course from the ministry's funds.
And Allah knows best when He will restore it to Him.
And when the accountants came and asked him about the money,
Of course, he can be in trouble.
No one knows, but he knows how to deal with her.
You're free, the man is in his office, and you're responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
Uncle, they call it theft.
On the first floor.
In, in a white box wrapped with blue ribbon and with a circle containing a picture of a dove's wing, put it, put it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me, if I don't have any problems,
Whole slave.
People call me Abu Yusuf.
You came to me in my final days.
Corrupt me, O Thursday.
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying. If it were someone else, they would have been slapped or something bad would have happened to them! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Khaled.
Salih, Salih.
Every way I've tried isn't working, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I can't back out of the marriage.
And you don't know them, they're all pumpkins.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the second one, the panic pill, the panic pill.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Yusuf, the stairs are full of discs, which one do you need?
The box with the picture of a terrified man.
We've already booked two rooms for makeup and hair styling just for us.
And we'll be there tomorrow.
I brought you Abdullah Al-Rowaished and his band.
You'll see, dear.
No, I won't tell you.
It's going to be the hit of the season.
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mama, Mama,
Goodbye.
There is no god but God.
Oh my son, don't forget to read the Mu'awwadhats when you enter the concert hall.
The women here have evil eyes.
I told you before that it's terrible.
The best groom ever, God forbid I envy you.
Mom, mom, the police are knocking on the door.
I erred when I obeyed you, O God.
It's not possible, today is my wedding day.
People came for the test.
Solve it now, imprison me, O Lord.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But this is what happens when this happens!
The company offered a contract for three million, two million of which was just for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but it doesn't reach this extent.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
Why didn't our shepherd object? They say he was with him!
As far as I know, I really don't know.
Where is the morality?
What is right has become wrong, and what is wrong has become right!
Oh my God! Saad, are you sure the minister has sacked him? Goodness gracious! What's happening to the world?
I just fired him!
What's next?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
That girl has a relationship with the minister.
What a strange world (proverb).
Your affectionate one, don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee whom the minister appointed in place of poor Uthman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh! Object to the minister!
Shame on you!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
That's him, standing by the elevator.
This is the reward for honesty and integrity, brother Saleh.
God willing, we can do anything for you, my brother.
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see incredible things.
I'm at your service.
Please stop by the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll go try, okay bye.
Who will take my sister home?
It's as if she's sitting in front of you, laughing and chatting. Who is it?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he gives me a ride home? It's fine.
Oh my god, I can't believe it, why do you look so backward!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You're old-fashioned.
There's old and new in right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that harmonize with the world and no one can keep up with them.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Manira. I can't help being nervous and upset.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her you're sorry.
Life isn't going the right way.
Don't be sad, come and eat your lunch.
Let me sleep to rest.
The manager is not angry with you.
Is the manager not angry?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and eat your lunch.
Okay, my love.
I'm really looking forward to meeting you on my first day of work.
Honor us, Your Honor.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
Yet, at the same time, it is a matter of great importance.
A reminder of some of the values and principles by which the institution operates.
In the public interest.
This is what your honor should be.
We all have to.
Division is absolutely necessary, Your Honor.
To be thieves
Thank you, thank you all.
What I want to say after my father.
And I'll even warn you about my first day at work.
There is one employee among you.
Who is sincere, devoted, and far from such bad things?
Just doubt.
This is a dedicated employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, things will be as you like, my lord.
Praise be to God, we're all thieves.
As you wish, sir, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, I praise you very, very much, may God bless you.
Alright, Your Honor.
Oh, my lord judge, you know how to choose!
May God guide you.
Why did you let the devil manipulate you?
You should thank God it was only about honesty.
Oh no, why is my father in prison?
Be quiet, girl!
No, no, I'll never do it again.
Oh mother, why is my father in prison?
Okay, stop.
This means he has become honest.
It's a shame to say your father is honorable.
This is a dress!
Your whole body is covered.
What will people see?
And if God wills you to find a job, no one will take you as you are.
Is there a respectable lady who covers her body and attractiveness?
She covers her chest, dresses like this, chokes herself.
I'm tired of her, my son.
And I bought her a blouse and pants that showed off her midriff above her navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I tell you!
You'll only blame yourself.
For the engagement of your daughter Sarah to our son Rashid.
One of us is just looking for the right man for her daughter these days.
Let me tell you, my son Rashid.
He is a good and wide boy.
What doesn't empty a cup.
He's drunk twenty-four hours a day.
Drunk, tipsy, and feeling heavy all day.
And don't ask about the sleepless nights and the revelry.
He was well brought up.
And let me tell you, he's also a hypocrite.
And how about theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how are the drugs?
Clear, it's done. I'll give you five riyals if you find anyone who can get it out of their eyes, I'll make a competition out of it.
By the way, oh! Abu Sara, we're just here to ask for her hand in marriage.
You know how to stay up late and have fun.
We know she came from a good family.
Congratulations, my son, congratulations, that's how life goes, congratulations.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Okay, come.
Goodbye, take care.
Okay, call your father to come and pick you up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, peeking out with his headgear with a blonde-haired woman.
By God, your father walks straight, he enjoys it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Oh Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yeah, that's right.
You confused me, my daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 1990, after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest being the claims raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Let's move on to the crucial meeting now.
Two-Riyal Man
When Israel agrees to establish the State of Palestine,
Oh man! What are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation and leaving me alone!
Well done!
Sorry, Sir Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find anything solid, stone or plastic as a commitment
Oh my God! Even our houses!
How do you call it, you Gulf people?
In Palestine, they are all made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And the gates of all our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very sensitive point, and I would like to vote on this matter because nail growth is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
So you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you'll start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The kids chase him and tear his clothes, and he doesn't do anything.
How many times has he come to me without his ghutra?
This is what the manager told me.
Rashid is kind, and we don't want to expel him.
The children are throwing chalk at him.
And they spray his perfume in the break area in front of everyone.
They said this teacher is very lazy and he ruins everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the deal with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He knows nothing.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Okay, stop.
By the way, your new boss who you're going to start working with tomorrow called me.
Anyway, it's fine, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The age of kindness and weakness is over.
Hey, brother! Abdullah!
You will see Rashid again.
And there's no need to remind you of the important educational saying,
You are an education graduate and I am an education graduate.
And we all know this quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see Professor Rashid the Strong.
And if anyone does a wrong,
There's going to be a problem.
When you start talking, he just said shut up.
You'll see what I'll say.
Who among you mocked me and said, "Just be quiet"? Who?
You're the one who told me to just shut up!
No, not me.
It's next to you!
Go, see the manager.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me!
What do you think of my tension?
It should only be like this on the first day; it should be like this all year round.
Beware of the consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
I explain or speak.
Do you know what that means?
It means nervous, do you know what nervous means?
It means "nervous."
Did you hear my words or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
Go to the manager.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Take your stuff.
I don't care.
Certainly, he is still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see it.
By the way, milk ice cream with strawberries inside is amazing.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and so does man.
I'm joking with you, my son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't find out about the story!
I don't want it, I want chocolate in my bag.
Okay, and you? Where's your bag? Where's your bag? Where's your bag?
In the school year.
I'm at your service.
She says she's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a regular kid.
Disaster, how can a disaster be green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the desert.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one bag of chips.
I took it before them all, I bothered them. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation CD from him.
So what do we learn from this story?
This person
He must have morals.
This is a PlayStation device. He also told me to bring the entire PlayStation device at once.
Alright, do you want something else, my friend Abdurrahman, my companion?
There's nothing now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
I thought I had to submit the event file before I traveled.
How can I pick you up at night? Abdulrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me when!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything, thank God I'm relieved.
Let's say he took it this afternoon and got upset and told his father, no, no, no disaster, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman.
May God help you.
What do you order?
Do you like it, do you like it this way?
Today, children, we will have a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon him.
Thank you.
I need water.
Whatever you ask, whatever you ask for, I am at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How do you ask for water from the teacher?
Is there a teacher who answers a student's questions, are you his assistant? This issue won't pass like this, I'll write it in the report.
And you're still messing with me, messing with me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, you hear me?
Is this enough for you?
Fine, is this your car?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What's he doing?
As you can see, he will be standing in an inappropriate place in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is done.
He studies abroad.
Okay, I broke the table.
Don't get angry, brother.
Why?
Are you different? (Example)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother!
What do you mean by "no need" when I want to help you?
What are you saying?
Instead of, what do they call it?
It seems you want it.
You want this, as you like.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
It's not up to him, that's not fair!
What the neighborhood has (proverb).
We are coming to my uncle Abu Naif to discuss not shouting.
Who is this Rashid who does what he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Come on, everyone! Be quiet and listen to what Uncle Bounaif is saying.
Now, this good-for-nothing is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I hadn't slapped him in the face to make him stay on the parachute he made,
The game is played by its players (proverb).
Is this acceptable?
Goodbye.
I haven't seen anything yet.
You know he owns a jewelry store now!
That's why I see her here wearing all these rings and necklaces.
May God compensate us.
Just walk, are you going to sit in the heat?
I can't believe that the naive and poor Rashid has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You're a teacher and he's a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
No thanks.
Don't mention it, Abdullah!
I'm telling you a secret.
The professor came, the professor came.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Professor, don't you know who he is?
Yes, my love, I know who he is.
Here I tell you, we won't get a good opportunity like this.
I'm looking for a job! It's funny, I swear it's funny.
No, brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Convey my regards to him.
Your mother sends you her greetings. May God protect you, I will tell her, he sends his greetings.
Okay, goodbye dear, in the protection of God.
What more do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, just believe it, my son!
Oh Mother! We will work, we will work to a high standard.
But, my son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He just gave it to you like that.
This is normal, right?
Enough! This is automatic, without any doubt.
This, my love, please fulfill my dream.
Before your dream, my dream.
Building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, let's go! What are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is angry.
That's just like my brother!
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
He actually stopped, took the phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm 100% sure Abu Sultan has his eye on it.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do it unless he means to do something else.
"By God, to that extent?"
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son! Don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes happen in the village.
But what I hear is unbelievable!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women will start talking about me. You didn't mention Latifa Jumaa Al-Hasa, she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I feel like I'm going to collapse.
Please, I know what to do.
This is none of your business.
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I am more deserving of becoming a minister than him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
Let him release it.
Yes, plan.
He should have trusted me from the beginning.
They told me they appointed him a minister because he was appointed before me by two months.
Because I'm quite sure he's getting fired from his job.
Magic may be undone.
What is this?
What's this again?
And at every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him until his image becomes very widespread in the newspaper.
It keeps rotting until it overflows on the surface.
Sure?
Just wait, let me work on it and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Of course, Your Highness.
Just tell me.
Did I thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be foolish, people want to give you a good reputation and you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. Just His Excellency the Minister, a photo, a photo of His Excellency.
Take another one second.
Oh brother! By God, I liked your plan.
I want you to take it to her.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he must be.
Okay, I'm telling you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say, "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist, okay, okay, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
Present everywhere (proverb).
They are envious, they envy you. Only the productive tree is stoned (proverb).
Take me to the market!
What's ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, and upon you be peace, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
Are you home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is acting up.
I'm tired, really tired. I've been running around with him for a month.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh my God! I just want him to take me.
You're starting to like it.
I saw with my own eyes what fame does!
I know, thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is anxious, it seems he loves this story.
I'll send my brother Saad to you.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants to destroy an ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
Don't remind her, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Normal to leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Walk, walk, walk and take your time. Walk and ask, walk.
God helps everyone.
Does this minister allow us to sleep or rest?
He couldn't find a party, a wedding, or any problem to throw himself into.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and couldn't find anything for him, his luck was as bad as his face.
Just shut up, bye.
I didn't find him a birthday, or anything.
Go, you can catch the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired, brother.
Oh man! The newspaper editor says the first thing we need to prepare is his picture, and then I'll prepare the newspaper.
She said my children had a contest based on your husband's picture, the minister.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the cafe and listen to the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. They never stop gossiping.
Oh my God, his death is so close.
As they say, when God wants to destroy the butterfly, He draws it close to the light.
They will leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't mention him. Who is he?
You've ruined my reputation.
God bless you and bless her.
"We all got married except poor Amal; she's the only one of us who didn't get married."
This is my fate.
It's written for me to get married.
And forget about marriage.
God is sufficient for whoever was behind that.
Do you see those spoiled ones sitting over there?
Yes, and what's wrong with them?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean was killed.
You saw it, it grew, right?
It's not right to leave him attached to the maid.
Go make tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mother. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two for him.
I've told you a thousand times not to interfere; Khalid is my son, not yours.
You don't have another problem besides Khalid, the male servants, the female servants, and Khalid.
Oh no, this is not good. Khalid is with the maid twenty-four hours a day and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my dad about you.
Let me tell you something, what's Khalid's problem?
Saud says Khalid wears makeup and acts like a girl. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Oh! Saud.
Khaled puts makeup on his face! But it's light makeup. A boy saw a makeup kit and played with it.
I saw a very small dot, and it's not even clear.
He is kind, friendly, and gentle.
Shortly after Saud shouted.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Khaloudi, my dear Saad, you will become an office, and what will you become?
This year we'll go to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the trembler in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khaleda, and Fahida.
And greet Samoura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you the land overlooking the sea or the one next to it?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Oh, wow! Aunt Amal, I want to open my eyes and hear that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
The way you speak has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
Do you talk to people like this outside?
How true! Oh Khalid.
Please leave my room!
Alas, Khalid!
You disappointed me.
Come on, don't make me angry, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Poor you, Khalid, my dear, I wish all children were as kind and sensitive as you are.
And when you see someone gentle and calm, you say he's like me.
Shame on you, it's wrong of you to say such things about your brother.
Alright, you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
Poor thing, he just uses a very sweet perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I tell you, don't say this in front of your father.
I have.
We'll show it to you, but be quiet so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How do these girls get along?
It's a shame for a beautiful girl like her to do such a thing!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he felt that it concerned him.
Ease up on yourself.
I know you're monitoring the widespread diffusion of Bluetooth these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, tell him to come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Ah, why?
Would you like something to drink?
I see him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He fears him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, for my sake, my child!
I have already booked.
I'm leaving, how can I face people? I can't!
And what should I tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, those kids, they only bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khaled was little.
Of course, this is the expected result.
Okay, please.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar was broken.
Impossible to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is locked for a bit.
And you're blaming me, Amal?
You're a girl and you spend every day at home.
What should I say as a stranger who spends all day meeting people?
It's difficult, really, O Amal.
I can't live my day and my life with my head always down.
The parent feels for a while that there is something wrong in the house and that there is a change.
For how long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don't.
I blame him, oh Amal, when I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live among people with our dignity.
And I do blame him.
When the father leaves the house, the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to reopen old files right now.
Does your father know or not?
But I'm ready for it.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
I'm going to be destroyed.
Oh, wonder! Oh, Hope,
Yermina knows.
It's much better to know from someone else.
Alas, our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called "Khalid" had exploded in it.
And customs and traditions.
You'll find them rude.
Stopping their ears from it.
And they don't want to listen to her.
They only listen to one voice.
Which one is dirtier and weirder?
And they trample on all that is good.
And what's on your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, "God help you, my son!"
May God help you.
It's the people who come back who bring the gift, not the ones who travel.
You're right.
This is the law.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did he see her?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Oh father, what's wrong with you, father?
Oh, dear!
Don't be sad.
You are a great person.
Any man would wish to marry you.
I only divorced you without any fault of yours.
I divorce you.
Because it's impossible.
This is me accepting my children's uncle.
I am like your brother.
"Be healthy."
You're here every day.
Before you even come,
I was hidden underground.
This was before we were on the metro.
These are very strong words, can you handle this kind of talk?
You get a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say "Insha'Allah."
Go, go.
I've only been here for seven months. Enough gloom, find me a way back home.
Shame and disgrace! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
The driver is making fun of you.
He came less than seven months ago.
His son annoyed me, annoyed me.
Give it back, so we can get rid of it.
Return it and get another one!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know the cost it takes from my time and money.
Leadership training. Send him to the back and be done with it!
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago.
Alright, I'll tell you something new.
Petroleum is now $114, before it was 50 cents a liter, maybe 5 riyals, everything has become expensive, oh boy.
Open your mind and listen to me!
When I first came here, what was the salary I gave you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've been here less than six months, and this salary of eight hundred is too much for you.
I need money.
The drivers you're talking about are old, old, and you're new.
Seven hundred became eight hundred now.
Walk!
He said, "I'll give you an extra hundred riyals."
There's no use in the three hundred.
What I told you is right?
No, no Shashi. I'll get hurt when I run away.
No, I think that's Sashi.
Those who run away from their sponsors.
Why are you afraid?
Because before these people were shepherds.
Give them a salary of six to seven hundred. Do you know how much they take?
How much is your salary?
I mean, why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
God suffices him.
Wake Nasser up and tell him to go see it.
No one.
Even the phone I bought was stolen.
What did you do?
What have you done!
They did what they could, took his passport and kept it.
You may go! Your Highness is excused.
We're looking for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They got us into trouble and harmed us.
I told you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him?
I'll find him no matter what.
He'll come back, meaning he'll come back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
Keep going with me, God willing, I will find it.
No one's buying right now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what are we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't score any goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared; you were afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Fantastic! The foxes have scored a goal now, you're leading by one goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, boss.
Why do you try? You can't defeat us!
Your Honor, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear his words?
He said: This is a big problem.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Will my friend's brother come to pick me up and take me to the stadium quickly?
Take it, my friend Sajid.
Take it, sir.
And what did he do to himself?
Yes, he is Indian.
Oh, man! He's a football fanatic.
Don't say that about my team, the Foxes.
They will win, they will win.
Come on, Sajid, come on, Sajid, hurry up, the match is starting, hurry up, hurry up. Take one bottle of water with you, the foxes are playing today.
Dear viewer, with us is one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club, Tha'lab.
They say you beat them because they were missing players.
What they say, what they say is not true.
And what's missing? Each team has twelve players.
Whether there's one or two, that won't change anything.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Okay, congratulations to Fox! Fox, any final words for the foxes?
All words stop.
When they mention the name of foxes.
Her name is high in the sky.
This fan is decorative.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him just as enthusiastic.
Come on, beautiful!
Okay, where's the Indian who supports football?
I haven't seen him for a while.
Oh my God! He's become such a big star now, he won't come here.
I saw the guy a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in Villagio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and didn't have money for a cup of tea.
The boy gave me twenty riyals.
What made him like this?
Oh man! He sits with important managers at the club, they assist him and provide him with everything he wants.
Can I say something off-topic?
I and my parents.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
These foxes are my heart's team.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes in it.
I haven't heard the poem, Your Honor, that was written about justice.
When we played a match against them.
Please, please, Thaloub! Read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. Oh my God, who knows my secret.
My spirit is very tired.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're a fox fan club.
You can't tell me the winner's name so I can have an exclusive scoop.
We will hold a press conference and, God willing, announce the winner's name.
Who spends.
The famous Thaloud, this fan who was honored today by the Fox Club management in a generous, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Fox, on this beautiful honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
This is it, father. I swear.
This is a sign.
I'm telling you, this is it.
We need to inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
Fans all, all, all the fans.
No, no, no! Oh, son, that's not it, it looks like him.
I'm telling you, that's not him.
I'm late.
I don't know the game schedules, brother!
Now how do we catch him?
We're just waiting for the Foxes to play their next match.
That's it, that's it, I've seen it.
Alright, let's follow him.
Brother, you're late!
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it.
Catch up to him, follow him, follow him, catch up to him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's this one or not.
I'm telling you, dad, this is it.
I say the truth and wisdom is that we go to them and ask them to talk to them about the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Oh dad, you always complicate things.
We talk about it, I'm sure of it.
Earth, God protect you. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Likewise the other land beside it.
Tell your father, Abu Abdel Rahman al-Subji, to greet you, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken! My son, we came to a friend and thought you were him.
God Almighty creates many people who resemble each other.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Honor, thank you."
No, no, please God. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
"Alright, if you please. I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God honor you, goodbye."
And you say you're sure!
How should I know what your father will do! I'm really not reassured.
What have you done, Waleed!
When, when, when were you, you were walking, the suitcase handle got stuck.
And try to solve the problem now!
Go to your room, go.
Inshallah, nothing bad will happen.
Inshallah, nothing bad will happen.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father finds out?
Shattered into a million pieces.
Okay mom, let's buy something like that as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Sorry, Mom.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
By accident, he hit the vase with his bag and it fell and broke.
Oh mother, I'm afraid for him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter!
You scared him and terrified him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he comes, I'll give you a call.
Inshallah, nothing bad will happen.
Auntie, I know where Walid is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
Come on, let's go. Please.
This is it.
Auntie, please, I don't want to go home.
Hide me with you.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear to God, I don't know.
This is how your father scares you, may God guide him back to the right path.
Come with me, my son!
Don't tremble, my son, as long as I am in the house, don't worry, my son!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid.
Please, I beg you, Abu Walid!
This time, I'll forgive him for it.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Come on, my son. Oh! Waleed, your father won't do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
By God! Yes, my son, yes.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and said he needed me to get him one like the one I got him that Walid broke.
He wants exactly this. I went and found only this, the last one in the store. He's very lucky. Where are the children?
In the room, he studies.
Alright, take care of him.
This is the game and I'm done.
Oh, wow!
Alright, study!
Just this game and then we'll study.
Come on, dad, don't tell uncle.
Oh, dad, don't tell my brother, oh, dad, I promise this is the last time.
In a word.
And you, in particular, have insulted me. Am I your friend at the café?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't watch out!
Alright, I won't call. Here's the phone in my pocket if you need to study normally.
Daughter, why don't you take us to the doctor?
May God guide you, mother.
He scares him to death because he beats him all the time.
Poor boy.
Be patient.
Mom, where is Auntie Ola? I don't see her with you today.
And she went with her.
My sister doesn't accept wearing abayas.
Oh my God! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
She gave birth to a baby boy. May God protect him.
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and was shouting in her face.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He has to take his son and chain him to the middle of the backyard.
And then he tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
This is much ado about nothing (proverb).
What did you say, Umm Munira!
I was telling her: Eat, eat.
Eat and good luck.
Poor me.
Mom, Mom.
Thank God your father doesn't know about you.
He'll beat you to death.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up and causes a disaster.
I won't listen to you.
Poor them.
They weep and tremble.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
What they failed at, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle's?
Nasser got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Here their uncle warned them.
Frankly, I agree with him.
Forget the feelings.
And my brother must punish them.
Alright, I'll take it, I'll take it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He's wasting our time, and I assure them that he's our son.
Why don't you get a perfect score?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
You don't listen to my words.
Shame on you!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Ah! Stop her, Uncle.
Next time, review well!
Okay, enough.
Do you know what I'm doing?
I'll make you jump one after the other and turn into falafel.
Be cautious about going to public places with your family.
He created a misunderstanding for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
Strange, you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Oh my God! My son, everyone has left, even the buses are gone. You'll have to wait for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance means he's waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, Walid! Come back.
Hello and welcome to a new episode of our program "Without Borders."
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of total energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the number one source of energy in the world.
The Gulf states and Iran together possess only six hundred and eighty-six billion barrels.
Iran follows with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Each of them comes after Venezuela by seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran possess two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded $109 for the first time in history.
In this episode, we attempt to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems faced by oil-exporting countries.
Despite its prices that have reached the sky.
Similarly, the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
which will appear later on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because today the market is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
Today, what determines the price is market power.
No, not OPEC.
Certainly supply and demand play a role.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
and stock markets and others
I moved on to prices in speculation.
Essential goods, such as oil for example
And tomorrow you'll receive a thousand dollars, and only God knows.
In 2004, the price of oil jumped from $44.
And today we see that even oil prices
Fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always, for the second quarter.
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, the temperature drops below ninety.
And all these indicators suggest that speculation has power and control over the market now.
"You've changed a lot" means "You were very different when we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see economic growth as...
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection to the so-called expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
It could quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The impact is definitely coming and will have its effect.
Even speculators react to political effects.
This could confirm, he will say, some of them will tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
What's going on in the market? The market is somehow optimistic.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in light of what the White House has stated...
And this returned the region to a tense atmosphere.
This is the mystery.
But Val had seen this scenario.
He has a quick reflex on the oil market.
Today, with the evidence of numbers, we have proven that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, oil reserves have increased to more than half in the past five years.
Today, I don't mean to say...
Even in the next war because I tell you today even the world has profitable storage.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues waiting at gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks posed by this issue?
What number do you think it is? I don't know.
Maybe three hundred dollars, maybe less but not much less.
You might arrive if these tensions become real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a distant country, even from oil-producing nations.
You'll see how the effect reverses on the oil market.
It can go up to three hundred dollars.
I moved from stocks and other things to the oil market. Today you'll see more than two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
Speculation is over a hundred a day - meaning -
These tensions in the region and in anticipation
April, as previously stated, will be the month to decide this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, it's Chinese.
In the area because now
This year is an election year.
And the current American administration still has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not expect events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America doesn't pay anything, it's you who pay, along with Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on African oil and has many other alternatives.
Let's be honest, there's nothing to see here.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent...
Oil reserves
But now they export twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and everything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves
So-called deep water production or deep seabed mining
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
Caspian Sea oil
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They ruin and destroy it.
The important means there is
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
The flow (of liquefied natural gas) makes these countries a tough number.
And the energy needs of states
It certainly means there's something called secure supply.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
President Bush is said to have
Try to notice how political risks don't come from the Gulf countries.
It doesn't mean it's not generous because none of us are dealing generously.
No, there is a lot of kindness in the treatment.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity.
Or being generous.
But Karim is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With America accurately.
Where is the market?
Wherever we find economic benefits, we go.
We don't win.
Like oil and gas
You do it for kindness.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
Not the rise in prices.
But the persistent decline of the US dollar
You are primarily a citizen of the GCC and OPEC countries.
Exports must be in dollars, and you refuse.
Exchange rates, even though the currency collapsed, therefore.
Even though returning is not in your favor.
No, we said it becomes 70.
This is the talk of experts, not mine.
Okay, the dollar has fallen by thirty percent and oil has risen more than this decline.
So if we take the measurement of the year in two thousand and four,
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course it means
The price of oil has increased.
But it's a minor increase, Your Honor.
So if we take it.
We consider it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to the year two thousand and four.
Until the rate of the fall of the US dollar exceeded
The exciting thing is
React to the dollar's depreciation.
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market is starting to feel.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the downturn two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and has become...
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
So the question is, why peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historical era.
Oil and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
Remember America in the mid-seventies.
The gold standard that the US dollar once enjoyed was abolished.
This is not correct.
Okay, tell me what the truth is.
OPEC comprises
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC represents a share of the world market.
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Dealing with the dollar in oil pricing
If you set a price in another currency, everyone will know.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, oh hero.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big ones.
Reserves, but I think it's export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under OPEC
Her share in the market does not exceed forty percent.
Non-OPEC producer and exporter
This can be linked to forty percent.
One doesn't know the worth of something until...
In some countries that tried but
What is a genuine attempt?
It's you who refuses because of your American commitments.
From dollar to another currency
All oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
It's a pity if they import them.
And his work became very high.
And he sells his oil in dollars.
Upon receipt or delivery, he received the money in dollars and then converted it to his local currency.
Its currency is not tied to the dollar.
True, but he...
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you don't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar in light of the dollar's depreciation?
I've been engaged for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had great purchasing power.
This chapter is not very easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, that's not right here.
Divorce has its costs.
This works in favor of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
The Dow Jones Index announced yesterday that there are four countries, one of which is Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf money stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, since Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement on Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been exiled.
He said yes and that there will be a study, but also all Gulf countries must.
Profit and loss must be examined very carefully, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for study and when they come.
Look, I can get you other economic experts who can conduct a second study.
This contradicts this study.
The global organization said something simple and organized, and issued it in a report on March 8, that is...
Just four days ago.
The global house is the simple solution and needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first of all.
Her intention or the five with Kuwait, regarding her intention in 2010 to issue the currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to abolish the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
To see United Kingdom currency
This currency is getting stronger.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world, as you said.
And what will come from huge reserves and returns.
That's why the Prime Minister focused on this when he said...
Gulf countries because no single country can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content
And today's economic growth, even to the euro, we see.
Of course, don't forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In assessment
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all this news
Tense situation
Two thousand and eight, as the observers said, the Global House stated that this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution lies in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflationary process that
And here is my question now: When will you increase the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your response after a short break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Saudi Arabia.
He has reserves amounting to two hundred and sixty-two billion.
And ten barrels out of twelve.
Nine out of ten produce daily.
One million, one hundred, one and a half Kuwaiti dinars produce two billion, seven hundred and seven million.
Qatar with fifteen and twelve billion produces eight hundred and fifty thousand, Oman with five and six tenths of a billion produces seven thousand and seven hundred.
Bahrain has one hundred and twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand.
The total revenue was thirty-eight billion per year.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in 2017
The total in 2007 is expected to be 799.7 billion.
It is in two thousand, nine hundred and twelve and one-tenth billion.
While inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and workers in this field.
But it will increase in 2008 to 3.8 percent.
Kuwait is fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine tenths of the UAE.
He will be ten years old while Saudi Arabia was six and a half years old, and he will turn six years old.
"And ten from eight" (Note:
Salaries are eaten.
So what are the amounts and percentages that you give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries always increase, salaries always go up.
What is the solution?
I have no objection to raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true
Always
Certainly, there is a belief.
In the event of an increase, an increase without controlling inflation will cause inflation to devour all these increases.
To tackle inflation, a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists is needed.
And now this committee is developing
Because salary increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics states
It won't have an end.
And no matter how
Raising salaries by a lot, and it doesn't matter how much they increase.
Inflation is going to increase.
The solution is obligatory and must be.
A scientific study conducted here at Bayt.com, the specialized employment institute, was carried out with the assistance of the British company YouGov Siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially for experts and professionals, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
You're considering moving from these countries where inflation keeps rising and "eating" purchasing power.
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, you put the simple concept, and try to implement it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
Balance exists.
Here there
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are trying our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
Increase means
We hope to have more time for this committee to ... (complete the sentence according to the context)
All applications
This is boring, Your Highness.
Boredom will always exist.
True, but the government tried and addressed the increases by forty percent.
Here's an important point regarding the topic of increases.
As for increases, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
It takes into account Qataris but does not take into account non-expats.
While the higher proportion in it
Oh Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone talks about it and suffers from it.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw.
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector has become...
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read a report, and as you know, we are in the oil field.
From work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the percentage increase in salaries?
Hope is in God the Able, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Temporary solution
"And we'll see, I'm sure."
that it will be
Positive results
It's around fifteen percent.
Okay, the second report says that twenty-two billion barrels of oil will come to you and forty-three billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, this is not the spraying process.
The procedure, of course, we...
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on people.
And this is reflected in the economic growth today, where Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa.
The massive carriers in the country are also part of it.
And were it not for these massive "carriers" and large projects.
In this country, it won't be part of inflation either.
Led to some inflation
And this also led to a lot of liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil for Protection
I am from the United States of America, thus the stability in power.
Many thanks
Saad al-Ghamdi is from Saudi Arabia, what's your question, Saad?
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
It's a nice episode with a nice title.
What I want to talk about is that the region is now subject to American policies.
American policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an unavoidable currency for the entire world.
I tell my brother to buy now.
And the Gulf region will become
As a place
Thank you, my brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Hello, Agent. Who is this?
Middle Eastern rulers, sir, remind me of...
When there is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjust the salaries against prices as you exactly said, Your Excellency.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
And he insisted on not promising an increase, this is genuine Arab style.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Tricka.
He has the right to say what he wants, do you have a question? Of course, this is his right, he is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
He must take into account his happiness.
This is one second that must respond to public opinion.
With the poor as I said, because they are the people of countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
Good evening to you and good evening to him.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, that's great.
Okay, thanks for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are sure of that.
And he ruled that Qatar, as he said, the money goes to the ruling family and to the governor.
And this is the important question now.
Let's reply to the brothers first.
We can't judge.
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities that are almost like Pearl and Lusail and other places, which means even Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case, the case is thus.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we only have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will go for?
Qatar today, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because it is he.
Non-renewable origin
Because it's a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's trend in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city houses some of the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not just the island, you'll make a hundred islands, and of course we can't afford the island.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, a major shift occurred, and now everyone remembers the shift of the '70s.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This requires a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
Our vision on oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Warm greetings this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
And the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, which were destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006?
And the unconditional support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon continues.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia for about two years.
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file where it succeeded when others failed.
The gathering of Lebanese leaders in Doha, where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Difficult files ahead.
The one who insisted on being the driver for these files was not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We try to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
And for whose benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country in geographical and demographic terms, plays these significant roles.
What are the qualifications that enable him to do it?
And this will be in a live dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us through the program's numbers, which will appear on the screen later.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's guns roar to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murra tribe.
In its issue of June 20th last.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things are not available.
What I believe is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I've always said that the essence is...
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover,
Different points of view.
It's true that the issue of borders has been resolved and it was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations were special.
These bindings, if we notice them.
Between the two countries and the two families.
I was destroyed by the misunderstanding.
Neither us nor them
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And I'm done. The relations now are in a state that I can assure you is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how were relations between Qatar and Saudi Arabia improving when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason in 2002?
There's an important point.
And I repeat, if you return to all the programs, I always say
Not only the elder sister, but I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
We value our relationship with her.
There was some heated media exchange, and this was clear to both sides.
These countries find themselves
Failed when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
They found themselves in conflict.
No sentences.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone in this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, may I put things in their proper context or dot the i's?
Many observers find that the island has changed significantly in the past two years.
At a time when the conditions criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still ongoing.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia?
Whether detainees, opponents, or others, are they still holding firm?
The island stood to address these issues.
Even Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has become politicized.
Praising the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of difference.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because I...
This unites the two countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you are referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the protector of the two holy mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in terms of views.
No, it's in politics and policies that there are viewpoints.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
They talk about the same interest.
Now I've been sitting for years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There's a difference between this topic and the second topic.
The idea of a small country challenging larger nations and making them feel vulnerable.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And his reasons ended.
It ended thanks to the wisdom of our two leaders.
Are there any warranties for future relationships?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on the bonds of fraternal love and mutual interests uniting the two countries.
And the leaders, their speech is considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope a lot from this Saudi-Qatari relationship for development.
For the better, and there will be more fields.
This relationship is similar to the one we have with other Arab countries, the other Gulf states.
Qatar is an important country.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that at the same time it reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera, which one?
For or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab state.
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And his interest
on many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
And this is the case.
One can believe that through this case we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say about respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people
We believe he is a good person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or at some point
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't believe it.
And we don't interfere.
In cases belonging to other countries
Interference in the affairs of any state is only justified if there is room for reform.
Does this mean that you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course I don't deny, in fact, we didn't know any more about it than others did from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different and caused a dispute among you on this point?
I'll come for this thing.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised by this matter.
Move in Qatar's interest.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids said: ...
An attack on Egypt and its position.
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they mentioned.
The days will reveal this.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak from it.
If we go back to the Mina Conference
After the Madrid Conference, do you remember the follow-up meeting held in Doha?
And this was an agreement, and when the conference was to be held with us.
They said they don't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What are we trying to understand why?
We sat and talked, and talking is always good.
It has two parts.
What are they?
There is a difference of opinion.
In political orientation
If we look at the Gas Conference held in Doha, we find that it was an important event that brought together many natural gas-producing countries.
His Highness Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
And we were informed by a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have a viewpoint on this matter that it should not be held.
People are being killed and we are watching.
If you want it to be held in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be shameful to discuss the issue on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference.
For Israel and the Western world, they stand and watch what is happening.
When we all said okay now, this is a common matter and there is no power or strength except by God, we as Arabs cannot stop it, not even a large country has stopped this battle.
Egypt's request for a ceasefire in Gaza, and within an hour, the fighting stopped.
Even us
We should not deal with the Arab street with such naivety. Our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This is in accordance with international standards.
And there are not enough hospitals, and doctors are being arrested at the borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
The brothers didn't receive her well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of its national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are only talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know his position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We hope a lot from Egypt.
The largest Arab country.
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even the subsequent rescue mission to Gaza
That the Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a conference or something similar, I consider it a bailout for the government.
We were invited to a conference that required us to coordinate between the Gulf countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be released to any party.
but will be released to
The affected parties in Gaza
Directly and this was
Because it's not possible to enter from any direction.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Just give me two minutes.
One minister was boasting about something that was refuted and said:
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail, they only talked about themselves.
And something that helped them in this, and I told our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis' intervention because the king has wisdom in this matter.
In a nutshell in the Arab world
We agreed.
That the King shall decide that this is in the public interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them is even an insult to those who were stopped.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
Maximum limit reached
He believes he must impose his strength.
We apologize for that.
If you think a small state has no rights, its rights are being taken away.
And you enter forcefully and stick your nose in Darfur.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A conspiracy I don't know what in Qatar
If it likely occurred after the swine flu appeared somewhere in Qatar, it would be the reason behind the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a wise policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it a pride for us.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position vis-à-vis our main issues, namely Palestine and all the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analysis became like theirs.
Western analysis
But on a subject we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way that makes me want someone to receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar offend any Arab country?
He tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
I could come by to greet you and you'd say: "May you be safe" just to provoke me.
This is a second case, meaning you either have a problem or you have a shortage.
This matter doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks what's in his heart.
"My heart, I always say this."
I always say this.
I always say that even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I was saying that.
And you can refer back to all the documents you have on the island but
The situation is different, no, no.
From one part we said no, this is not enough, let's stop at this situation.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
Let them see their own affairs and where their mistakes are.
Seeing our mistakes doesn't mean everything we do is wrong.
Do you mean His Highness, Sheikh?
Due to internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes to any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and attempts to undermine its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million if we can make it, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
That you played a role in the Shalit case, despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And I sought help from the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
We said, "O brothers, this issue concerns the Egyptians," and they replied, "Yes."
We want to see this issue as a request.
From Israel and another state we'd like to see another part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions applied, the brothers should speak to the brothers in Egypt.
And we announced this, I mean, is there a responsible person who can say 'we', that is, he deceived the Arab League.
This means he is poor.
How did she manage to get past us?
Allow President Mahmoud Abbas to stay.
And we supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I own the island, as they say.
And the island must engage in media competition just as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets, and during adolescence, they all insult each other.
But after a while, they reach maturity.
It might be or it might not be.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country, as Egypt is the largest country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
These are personal disagreements between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a disagreement of politics and opinions.
I told you about the problem during the attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And since it leaked to the press, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
I had a meeting with Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable separation
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say, so that no one explains it, that you are comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Reda among the children
I don't think Egypt is that big, I guess he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for solving Egypt's problems, or are you like the Egyptian people waiting for divine intervention?
I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I pray.
He was deceived by their trick that there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt
There must be a certain way.
Either you stand with me or against me.
And no matter how much pain the Arab citizen feels
In the Arab world, we struggle with this, and it is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
States derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power, the sources of France's power, and the sources of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
What's clear is that
You're trying.
But we're a small country, and I took that into consideration.
And I'll repeat it a hundred times.
No one even says we have allergies.
That no one will take us
For Israel, you have been tickled now.
Okay, before I go to Israel.
How can you resolve the issue with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, if you mean the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us on the basis of self-interest, and so do we.
All complaints and all
To sabotage the relationship.
I think any great nation that does that will affect its image.
It will further affect our Arab shame if we run to complain about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there upcoming steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If there's anyone pulling the strings behind the curtain.
Opposing the interdependence of the two countries and the two leaderships will find himself losing.
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe in ten years, I really don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll attend.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
We can't.
Because Egypt is our older sister, but we have different perspectives and we discuss them with each other.
This is all that is required, and when the time comes we will be very happy.
It was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you ask about the number of contracts that were cancelled, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, last June 4th, your closing of the Israeli office aroused the feelings of the Arab nation, and that was published in the opinion section on June 4th.
Why do you say we're gossiping about them? If we wanted to gossip about them, we would have done it twelve years ago.
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation of most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or above the table, or talk to it in any way whatsoever.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we could have done that at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner in honor of Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
I was one of many guests who attended this party, and I don't know why the ambassador did it.
Because at the United Nations, we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the administration has changed, and I had a small window of opportunity for the Egypt issue, but unfortunately...
What I was, you were.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your relationship (people of Qatar) with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There is a difference of opinion.
Jadi is solving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with America is poor.
First, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you see the agreement still standing, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would enable them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We followed it day by day and minute by minute until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have ties to the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon, you know how Qataris love Lebanon and die to go there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about the situation in Yemen: Q: What's happening in Yemen?
You intervened in the case of the two whales, and there are some accusations that you supported them.
Or your involvement put them face to face with the state and now there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the South.
We went through a lot of suffering, which indicates why we are standing here instead of standing there in Qatar.
"We faced many pressures, but this was our vision and the position of His Highness the Amir."
The topic of the Hawaitin.
His stability positively affects us, and instability negatively affects us.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if this is intended for use for other reasons.
And we were with them, and we always stood by them in all situations.
And what is based on facts.
I see that we have no need.
We sell it.
I say this with apologies, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you, and welcome to this special meeting.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why would I say it's a special and exceptional interview? This is because...
Qatar and this particular man were the main sponsors.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and Lebanese management from both sides was important.
To achieve some results
External intervention is very important.
An abundance of opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arabic if you want to say
She went through stages, but she meant it.
That there is nothing unless these stages were there.
This means that the complexities in Lebanon...
Since the time of truth
I mean when you were all gathered and now directly came on the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
I discovered that the Lebanese community is very large?
The international regional Lebanese dialect that requires significant encoding
Or it's a simple complex but has been amplified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many other things.
Lebanese people shouldn't allow that.
Impact on peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
External effects in Lebanon
I suddenly decided after twenty-four hours to take everyone on a single plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect it, they can't rest for a single minute unless you are generous and leave them alone.
The secret is not to give them a chance to rest and think too much.
I make a lot of calls.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you'll gather them with great difficulty.
In many circumstances
We moved them from these circumstances to ones where they could find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this mood.
And quickly.
God has granted us success with the Venetian Statement or the Beirut Statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believed that Qatar favored one party over the other.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
His Highness's policy is that if we are intermediaries,
In this process
Honest, frankly.
Were you seriously consulted?
With at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in the Kingdom of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
Support the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It had to be removed due to the tension in Palestine.
There is the case of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring together the parties.
And why can't Arabs with ancient ties hold conferences to find solutions?
Unite the Arabs or unite the parties if necessary, and intervene to support the oppressed.
This should be under study.
If we want there to be a wake-up call for the Arab world, not the Arab League.
The Arab League is just an instrument for implementation.
One of the officials who was here was Speaker Nabih Berri.
It requires a double "s".
Now it seems the Lebanese have agreed.
Alright, listen, we...
And above them, Qatar.
What led one day to a result.
In the interest of the Arabs
It will be considered a force for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Convention.
Agendas are made for solutions, not other reasons.
There's no doubt that
And play a more important role in the entire Arab world.
Placement
Alright, we agree, stop it.
We call on others to come and help us.
Because this is a serious matter, but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our neighborhood?
In our art
It is extremely important to place the interests of our people above everything else.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do about Somalia?
What are we going to do about Somalia, as it is not a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world, and a small one at that.
I hope this isn't just a suggestion, this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we're not asked to do anything, we'll do what we can.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, the struggling president, Bashar.
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It can only be a transient stage.
And God willing, we will find.
Nevertheless, I insist on asking, if you don't mind, could you take on a role in this scene?
Even if it's not public yet, you kind of have the confidence.
What rapprochement between Arab states do we seek?
And this has been His Highness's approach since the beginning, but this matter...
Does what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is about to make serious adjustments?
Or what happened in Lebanon is a particular local affair of the region that is still ongoing.
What's related to this situation?
I wish the opposite, I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It happens somewhere else.
In another sense, happiness, are you afraid of the escalation that was present a while ago?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There's no doubt I still have concerns about Palestine, especially the Gaza issue.
I want to ask
We need something else.
He asked me to pay attention to the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can't provide them with medicine.
And I didn't eat.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The one who dies when the power cuts out.
I wish
The Arab League agrees to allocate an amount for this food and medicine, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver them.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But please excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, I'm just saying that as Arabs, we need to provide medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made tremendous efforts and pledged at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
Their saying "Don't deal with this party because we will find you a solution" is incorrect.
And I
So far, I have no signs of healing.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us we don't want you to have relations or connections with Israel.
Some people may consider you an integral part of it due to the American rules present there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia:
He may have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, from the negotiations between Syria and Israel
I could say it was a coincidence.
The second issue that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was keen to find a solution for, and I was in communication with Prince Saud regarding it.
What happened in the last few hours?
Changing tactics, changing negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible for
And from all sides we shut ourselves in the room.
In the end, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was very important.
And from this, intervention efforts succeed.
Without mentioning it, it's over now.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, our role, and so on," as if to say...
He wanted to take a role without provoking any other party.
Whether it's Arab, national, or regional.
But even if
I became responsible.
Do you want it or not?
We are trying to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
that these countries
Can do or not?
I believe this will be the profitable combination.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term? Is it ordinary or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
This doesn't mean we don't have different views in some cases.
But this is our right, if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How can it be good? How can you interpret it in real life?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Similarly, health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and make that clear in the next phase.
In my opinion, we should set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we wanted to stop the play in the Arab court
Reconcile the differences among the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have any.
To be effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our esteemed viewers to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the Arab political reality and the Arab effort.
Welcome, Sheikh.
Investigate what's happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Shed light on some of your questions.
The Israeli entry into Gaza in a brutal manner.
Our goal was a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Fellow countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance that Arab countries agree upon?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
And no one was sentenced during that time.
We are held accountable for everything, whether intentional or unintentional.
We are the specialized people.
In the world, they are the only ones who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in some way
I think
To the extent that we won't be able to.
For a meeting at the leadership level
To halt the discipline campaign
We didn't intend to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other oral agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They wish that what they believe is right and what we believe is wrong, because the goal is...
Solving the problem is not the pinnacle.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now is that the ministerial committee not reject Qatar's request.
Which His Highness also confirmed.
In the speech he delivered, he emphasized that if holding the summit in Qatar would cause any embarrassment, we would not insist on it, and the summit could be held elsewhere.
An Arab stance that others respect us through
Yes, and the ministry.
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He was not involved in the decision and continued to kill and bomb in Gaza, and still does.
And I need to ask the Arab what we're doing with it?
What shall we do?
When will Israel end?
To implement the remaining provisions of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a situation since Israel has not stopped.
Photography, we do not force our brothers.
To a final decision
A few days ago
We're talking about the ministerial meeting.
You'll end up supporting this.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our proposal. Some other countries also requested the summit, including Syria and Yemen.
There's actually an understanding Arab here.
Or they classified us into the camp of moderation.
And the camp of immoderation.
What do they mean by immoderation?
Arranged by the West
As moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You won't find a moderate or non-moderate nation.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation, does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And they end the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we just need to keep the case open.
I mean, this is an important matter.
Are the countries
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their own ways.
I don't want to say that he follows Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name a camp Moderation
What is moderation in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree to the slaughter of a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections were held.
I'm neither for Hamas nor against them, but I'm speaking from the reality we're living in.
The existing truth is that there is
Idea
What some people call extreme activism
But we must ask ourselves: What does this extremist movement want?
Is it for something other than his rights or is he claiming his rights?
Aren't we going to arrange them?
And create other blocks as well.
Against because we
Internal and intellectual Arab
And he began to speak.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who cancelled the Arab summit?
I can't say they banned it, there were efforts and the topic was almost known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could have.
Vote and gather two-thirds of the votes.
But that wasn't the point, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, that's what we believe.
While others believed it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or in the Security Council resolution
But the decision lies with the Security Council; Israel said it would finish and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We are not exerting efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
Sometimes alterations lead to disagreements.
As much as, to the extent of
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Also addressing the Israeli party and informing them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Forty-eight and we agreed on a forty-eight-hour truce, but the Israelis did not comply.
It is natural for disagreements to occur in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements...
Representing their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the reported fights is
That some have described Hamas' movement as diaspora.
Not even a little
This incident occurred and we responded to it, and there was one of the ministers present.
And I believe this is what the West says.
These are radical movements, disintegrating, and other names.
And we don't want to be men for others.
And thus it always means, and I don't intend it to refer to anyone.
Which foreigner did they find?
In any Western country or Western countries you find
Among the Arabs
Okay, now His Highness the Sheikh
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the nation of two hundred and thirty?
One million Israeli marketing
Issued after Resolution 1868
The issued decision.
Israel hasn't carried it out, it will carry it out after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
This is what you should be thankful for in this decision.
To demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And when they are asked, they say, "We understand."
What is the Arabs' fault if... (then complete the sentence according to its context)
If that's the case, Israel won't be held accountable.
She is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab Summit to what was going to be issued by the Security Council?
At the top, the Security Council will seek for us.
A firm decision is needed.
"Decision that" (Note:
Can cause a official to lose his position
We were terrified of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq entirely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
We do not demand from the Iraqi government, nor do we demand for those who have died.
No compensation.
The same thing exactly happened in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Your happiness
His Highness Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
Israel has not committed to.
He walks with her after two days, after a week, after he finishes the mission.
Because they didn't commit to it.
Sorry, but people must comply.
Because Israel agreed after it had finished the mission.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we've done
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and I don't mind having any kind of relationship with the West, and I am not...
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
And in the end, they take one percent from our perspective and say we won.
What is the meaning of victory?
Including its contents
I can't say anything about precautions right now because the decision hasn't been made yet.
The council is master of itself.
I participated in the training.
Yes, we participated in the training to some extent.
But I wasn't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went were enough.
I pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For two years now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend we were aware of everything.
If they were people who
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there the conflict began and the siege started.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we'll let them starve until they're finished because we don't want them to be in power.
Those parties, Your Highness Sheikh.
I clearly stated that the Palestinian conflict...
I mean, if there is
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
You're telling the party no, you're 100% right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I don't claim that and I don't say that.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not only the mediator, but we Arabs, too, are equidistant from everyone.
But the unwillingness to have him there means it must be ended by any means necessary.
Once in training troops right and left
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And once we establish a positive model in the West Bank
Let the people in Gaza see how people live.
Luxury living
While the reverse is true in Gaza.
I was invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but this time
What is being circulated now about Turkish mediation between Hamas and Israel.
This meeting you are invited to attend is going to beat around the bush.
There will be backlash if we make another initiative.
We don't have initiatives.
On this subject
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We call for a role to be taken and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But it's important.
Don't come.
Tomorrow's party seems to have overshadowed another party.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what's required from Egypt?
The current proposals, the current initiative does not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency that should be there, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Those who are injured on the other side, we must also take their perspective into account.
Until we complete these intermediate tasks.
By the way, to get a different perspective
Hamas' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into consideration, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in drafting without communicating or consulting the main party concerned with the issue.
We just want, of course, to deal with the Palestinian country as a country.
We deal with the authorities as a single party.
But now there is a split in one party somewhere and another party elsewhere.
This means that if we deal with people from Gaza, we will have to stop dealing with people in the bank or the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced about her?
Firstly, regarding the decision, it did not specify a mechanism; it welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some considered it a mechanism.
This is an interpretation, but from my readings of this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in implementation.
This stops the fighting.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this resolution to be non-existent because Israel did not accept it.
Even if accepted later, things on the ground will change.
Yes, His Highness is talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or Arab disputes that cannot be resolved, so they came to fill a vacuum.
It is assumed that Arab parties will fill them.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A platform that Arabs and Muslims are expected to appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people should follow him.
There's no Arabic word that fits the situation.
They say let them finish the mission.
There must be a clear and decisive Arab stance against all this ongoing aggression and procrastination.
That there will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I'm not talking about an Israeli-Arab war, and we are the ones who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I don't call for an Arab war, I call for...
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course you follow what's happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
You believe?
Now as an observer on the ground
And the politician who resulted from the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second job.
What I know about these negotiations, as I told you, they aren't happening, yes, now they are negotiating.
The second job.
Positions required for Arabs.
This is Arab realism.
We have witnesses after the start of those operations.
It seems that there is a very advanced position being taken by the Arab street.
As governments
Of course, I regret that some people describe the gift of peoples
They're telling me this issue again.
Representing people's views
The presidents now.
I mean if they want to
At least they see what
Of course, there's a high demand and a modest demand.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
The Israeli representative office in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
Consider that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
Not at all if we had an Arab agreement.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
Let's walk with our Arab brothers.
I wish there was a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that have none of them.
Very important
Don't become agents for others.
He says, "Why doesn't Qatar set an example in this field?"
If this is the only model, we are ready for it.
But we also want
Qatar's model is committed as part of its Arab commitment.
For example, for example
And no one sells one to the other.
Our problem is that there is no trust between Arab countries.
Unfortunately, I don't want to say how we did it, I don't want to say who our connections are.
That's why it's very important.
For formal invitations only, because we need to rise above this.
Some called the ambassador, others organized protests, and some expelled the ambassador like Chavez.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador and called on the permanent member states, and all of these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
For high hopes, there are those who demand the opening of the fronts. There are those who demand that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you we call for peace and we don't call for fighting with Israel.
And we don't want to fight Israel.
To ignite a war with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
This is what makes us talk to each other, what overcomes our differences.
What His Highness said caught my attention.
In the event that countries do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street doesn't show us any mercy.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what's happening today a continuation of a project that started during the 2006 Lebanon War?
Or is there a disagreement?
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon was a free land.
Of course, some parts are supposed to be a deposit for the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon, I mean we've dealt with the Lebanese situation a great deal.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
Until you prevail and have the upper hand.
Certainly, there are countries supporting them and they are foreign.
That's why you want to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And how many sides does it have?
In Palestine, there is only one side.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they have listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And this is where the gap began, and everyone thought they would control the other side.
In your opinion, as an observer and follower
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Or express his opinion.
Whether it's Israelis or others in the future
And we set a high example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral proverb that says: "Me and my brother against my cousin, and me and my cousin against the stranger."
Now we are supposed to be at odds with Hamas, and I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must leave this subject.
He made him kneel down.
Because here, failure will not be a group failure.
Your Highness, Qatar usually means that in a previous period it was trying to submit proposals.
Initiatives to reach solutions have occurred in Lebanon.
It happened in Darfur, we can understand it in a minute, even if we're in a hurry.
We
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are sensitivities.
This country alone is making all these initiatives, we have no objection as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar the headline news.
One of His Highness the Amir's goals, may God protect him.
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
And stop the hegemony.
What happened surpasses imagination.
"And we are in Qatar."
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach an honorable solution.
When talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative has achieved in resolving the Darfur issue by the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And the focus will primarily be on resolving the Darfur issue because the Darfur issue is at its inception.
Help the Arab.
But we internationalized an issue we shouldn't have.
Based on revenge against the system, and when we want to solve the problem, we don't know how.
As I mentioned earlier, we always strive to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
Removing the case from the competition. Is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we summarize the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will you go to attend this summit that will be held?
No, we will attend the summit.
We wish it had been held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
It will be a disgrace.
Agree if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
While Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they were gathering for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances I'm referring to. Of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety comes first.
To ensure safety
But no one takes anyone in their little pocket.
The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, expresses his profound gratitude.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
So what is the usefulness of this celebration and the credibility of the High Commissioner for Human Rights' statements?
People with disabilities are the most marginalized in the world.
How is our Arab region, and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
These and other questions will be asked of our guest on today's show.
Former Special Rapporteur on Disability for the United Nations Conference on Disability
She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy as well from Helwan University in Egypt
He held several positions in the field of disability.
And she was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And the Vice President of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999 and 2021.
One thousand two hundred and three
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for People with Special Needs.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
He also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Sister Hessa, to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities" or "persons with disabilities."
Initially, we started using the term "disabled people" perhaps in the 1980s or earlier.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide them with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
Before we delve into the details, let's define the term.
From other regions, although there are regions that are unclassified or classified as developing countries and classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend is stronger there than in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
There is a trend towards legal rights in the Arab world, and they exist in many countries.
It is possible that resources exist and political will also exists.
Okay, here let me tell you some statistics that you might know.
Eighty percent of countries are poor.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
How can you not comment on these statistics, Lady Hawsa?
To a large extent, it's true.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, you can't distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy one because they are in large numbers.
In fact, children with female illiteracy, for example, are almost fifty or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from reaching school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have infrastructure even if this child found that school.
He can't make it.
For children and other residents
"Agendas and projects are great, but we rarely hear about them."
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago. What's the point of this day?
The situation in the world
Better than people who don't have a disability.
Organizations arrived and established numerous projects.
Implementing a very crucial health strategy
Through this strategy
There is an intersection between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and it is better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and continue our conversation.
Many thanks
I have two questions I've been wanting to ask her since her days at the United Nations.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against regimes that create obstacles for society for the sake of the child, now for example, the Syrian intelligence regime.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the entire regime as is the case in Syria?
Your question is clear, Solomon. Solomon Kro is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Naif Saeed from Kuwait. Welcome, Naif.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If you don't mind, I am one of those who suffer from a mental and intellectual disability.
The Arabs say, "A free man understands by gestures."
And there is a verse in the Quran that says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah has given us speech. Glorified is He who gives speech to all things."
A thirty-year session without speaking a word or two a day.
"So praise Allah, who has granted you preference over many of the people of the world."
I was referring to the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me, not knowing they are at the bottom of hell.
All I got was accusations.
And don't tell the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls within the same definition.
UN programs or what are their reactions to the causes of disability such as political goals or otherwise.
The spirit of the law is the essence of various organizations and institutions.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out to what extent.
In their work agendas, there are topics and disability cases.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already included disability
It's one of the programs that try not to lose disabled children from sight.
Good opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings. We must acknowledge that there are also shortcomings in the United Nations.
What are the main points of weakness and inefficiency that you mentioned?
United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered things.
My work is sometimes private, especially during restrictions or shortages.
Struggle or attempt to confront people with disabilities for recognition.
Until it reached a somewhat satisfactory point, unless it was placed in a separate article as desired by the Global Disability Movement.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there's no coordination between them.
This is one of her most significant shortcomings.
Survey, conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and entities, and they only provided us with three responses.
Do not put.
The issue of disability is a persistent and ongoing one that has existed for many years, even though it is primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability has been raised at least through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international regulations?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating salaries to people with disabilities.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
The final remark: If there were no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
She said she would adopt this proposal.
It is a direct writing to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
It is converted into this box.
Productive factory
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer callers' questions.
He said he advised the doctors to perform surgery, but
It cost a lot and he can't afford it, where could he find help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
A citizen must obtain all these rights and duties.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
And fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national framework.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Obligatory for all states and is restricted to ensure the enforcement of these laws.
At least at the level of officials, there should be awareness.
It must be at least if we work on these treaties in this way.
Even if there's no great commitment towards it.
Is there any response to the surveillance reports about what you're doing and was there any concern?
But don't forget the rules, they are morally binding, not legally.
I have a legal obligation.
And he understood that these cases would be resolved or discussed or that they would be in the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zcharna, Manager, Qatar National Center for Sign Language Expert in Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere gratitude to the island.
They just broadcasted this episode live.
Is Ali speaking and saying that he is very proud?
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
I also think there are many people with special needs.
Some of them don't know about this agreement because there are no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with disabilities in all countries of the world.
And I emphasized and insisted on these countries to
Adopt and sign this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aiming to serve people with special needs and us.
"Many thanks to our colleague Naji, speaking on behalf of Ali."
Many thanks
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur when engaged in his or her work.
Even the Arab countries did not donate, except for one: Syria.
Fulfilling those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
Lack of commitment and interest from member states, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we don't care about the situation now.
In fact, the issue of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, especially.
But for this reason, there are those covenants.
It is a good idea of the brother for these countries to fulfill their duties.
In addition, it is essential that there be no single independent box, meaning independent in form, but rather existing organizations in the region.
I have it in their budgets.
Providing private projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for People with Disabilities
The issue always involves political factors.
His state or government supported him greatly.
Unfortunately, reduce the number.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, I revoked the citizenship.
They took his daughter from him.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
We mix when traveling or going out.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Bahja Karwan from Kuwait.
Hello Aisha Mohammed from Qatar
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
For the continuous support of Sheikhah Hessa to them.
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
At another level, the genetic one
I believe there is a genetic level of care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a cousin marries his cousin and so on.
In this way, at this level, a level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as I said, at the national level
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Falls under healthcare services
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I believe in the mental clinic and also programs in the Supreme Council of Education.
Special Education Department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists.
But certainly it is within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And rehabilitation is offered for such cases.
Prevention is better than cure. With reference to genetic factors and consanguineous marriages, are there any awareness campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
One of the things that I and others have dealt with a lot of talk and a lot of participation.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not just targeted.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And confirming, Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
which have been implemented in many countries
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it conflicts with customs and traditions.
Of course, its difficulty arises when it clashes with societal culture.
I have a decision, I have strategies, and I have the will to deal with it and commit to it.
The issue of early screening, for example, because it is a very important issue before marriage.
She asks if there are any statistics on people with disabilities.
And in particular, people with disabilities from the Arab region.
The Arabic region
Especially
With the recent events that have taken place in the region
In conflict zones and areas of war, especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
For every person killed, there are three disabled.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
Not at all is not enough and first the issue.
Human rights principles
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Agendas within existing institutions in government ministries and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only to the words of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and more strangely, the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that the population census does not include this category, which is really strange.
To this day, people with disabilities are not included in statistics conducted on the resident population.
What they always announce.
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In cooperation with the Planning Council and in coordination with concerned authorities, we are working.
In fact, this report was prepared by the Council with the involvement of entities such as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
To create more classifications for disabilities.
A foregone conclusion
Types of these needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are progressing in some way in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you to Sheikh Hessa.
But praise be to God that I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receiving a good education, praise be to God.
I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Her motivational role and the role that makes us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those upon whom this category relies.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
God willing, you will be able to answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
And I testify to the special service provided by the State of Qatar for hearing impairment.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Until civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities gather.
Because reality and what we hope for, if you compare them in five years,
What has been provided to people with disabilities five years ago and now?
Many thanks to Karim Naem from Jordan, and now we return to our guest.
Of course
The community as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families who own...
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations from...
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children without documents or others, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international convention resembles many international documents.
I committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, sexual orientation...
Okay Sheikhah Hessa, you previously served as a Special Rapporteur, you were at the United Nations dealing with disabilities after six years of work.
Wished?
Perhaps the time wasn't sufficient or the financial aid wasn't adequate.
There have been many achievements, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger-scale studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and radically.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves are people with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty to fulfill.
They have to fight for
Many thanks
Many thanks
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
God willing, we will meet a new guest tomorrow.
Join us with your messages and contributions in a new episode of "Live"... See you soon.
Good morning
I'm very happy to have you here with us.
First, before we start asking various questions and chatting this morning
Thank you, Shayma. Maybe I've congratulated you.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has really put a pin on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
"Likewise Ali, come on Hala! Ali" (Note: Names are not translated as they are proper nouns.)
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I extend my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens for hosting the tournament.
And, God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and we will start working today or during the advertising period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite the presence of strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, what made you afraid in this field in this particular subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I told you Qatar would take seventy percent.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitive.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's bid was very strong and they deserved it.
It's true that in twenty-twenty-two, the World Cup was hosted in Qatar.
What do you think, and what do the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I'd like to say, we were talking off the air, but we want to hear that on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, were you shocked? Tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and hosting of the tournament,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, the characteristic...
I went to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We had interviews afterward.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar now, daily, is being mentioned.
A hundred times a day, looking at it as the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by being in the team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
I mean, it's a positive thing to work hard and put effort into one's job.
He is in the league, even while in the league he exerts all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the officials have worked hard on the young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Eat, Sleep
Tell me about your experience. You've played at different age levels. How was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step through the league, from the cubs to the first team.
Do you know how to camp with the club and the league?
For every stage has a special sign.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between...
Now we're used to you as "Lana" the athlete.
We always see you as a sporty lady. We love to follow you and get sports news from you. So, how is sports going with you?
Frankly, I don't see the difference from talk shows. In talk shows, we used to interview famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also interview stars.
Like Ali and the rest in their sports field.
On the contrary, the stadium is a bustling sports arena.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And Qatar has now become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of offering a variety of talk shows, social, economic, and cultural programs
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's a sport after all.
Strange, wonderful
Frankly, I wished
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
I think the young players have gotten a huge opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they should take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
They enjoy a great advantage from it.
Tell us, what are you doing, what are the new programs you are offering? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will kick off in January.
We finished the Gulf Cup a few days ago, by the way, we'd like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The news bulletin is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari TV, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Deliver the media message across different channels.
Whether they are private, sports, or other channels
So, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you success; we are still on the same topic.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And his supporters, I was at Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
He is still at the club.
I'm still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
This belongs to every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people love and are already addicted to sports.
How to Make Sports a Social Issue
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in all the various fields of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, as schools have also become aware of the importance of sport in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see posters in the streets, which reflects sports awareness.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and elsewhere.
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the sports field.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for Qatari players.
For I believe that sport is evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce large-scale projects and raise sports awareness, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If considered and implemented carefully.
Enough, and at the same time it must be used wisely, as you said.
Also, there's a point, which is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, the possibilities, the experiences, and the equipment.
There's something else that's important, alhamdulillah we are in Qatar, as you all know, all Arab and Gulf societies are famous for their love of sports.
How to attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending the games at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When browsing web forums, you'll find that there is a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, in your opinion, what is the best solution to attract you to attend, aside from being an athlete or player?
How can you attract the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there's no general concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering at home.
For example, Japan, Japan has developed a wonderful plan to attract the public massively.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something similar, so they are looking for solutions, so, God willing.
And in Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar especially in two thousand and twenty-two, Lana, what's your opinion on what we need?
Aside from financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to prepare them as a national team and participate in global events, such as the World Cup.
Time flew by with such lovely people. When the producer told me time was up, I said, "Really? God willing."
Always achieve the impossible, for it realizes the dream we thought was impossible. Alhamdulillah, we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins now.
And God willing, the year 2022 will be an event recorded in the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host two thousand twenty-two
Thank you, Lana, the outstanding presenter. I wish you all the best, and I will always watch your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new kind of music that is popular these days.
But in a repetitive manner with fast music and rhythm.
And also a group of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and good morning.
We'll try to take a look at it.
We can briefly define rap as fast music.
Repeats, but does not rapidly chant the song lyrics.
It consists of numerous poems addressing a variety of topics and issues.
It can sometimes be personal.
Social, emotional, or political.
Often controversial,
I am quite liberal.
The rapper performs, our viewers sing along to the lyrics.
But he brings it back.
He flatters with his voice, which he considers a secondary asset.
Generally, sound isn't important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or an MC.
Rap singers are keen on the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and performance.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rap.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished in something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
Why don't we have it in Qatar?
So we said, "Let's invent something new."
We gave him an idea that contained a message.
We discuss the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
I mean, we convey a message first and secondly it's art.
This is an art form from diverse arts, it is for the visual science, it has addressed many social and psychological issues among youth in a radical way.
Time changes, and I think that has something to do with the changing of the times.
Before, there was a bit of acceptance.
We've been singing since about 2005, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
He is more acceptable and popular.
People love singing and performing in a way that's similar to rap style these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
Similarly, there's something we want to talk about, you were the founder of many teams.
A great band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about for someone to form a band, and how many are there of you in this band?
Initially, before we formed the band,
Rap came to Doha starting in 2005.
That means anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and upload it on the site.
I can carry, Salman can carry, anyone can carry, so there was a competition.
We met people.
So we started competing with each other.
Then, after a while, after all these years, we reached 2010.
Before 2010, it was a group system, meaning this group on its own and three or four together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one group under the name Rappers of Qatar?"
Or in English, Q-Tip.
So we agreed on this, and we said under one name, and we are all one hand.
And when we come to present this thing, we say the same idea.
Approximately twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! Hopefully a large group.
I mean, does anyone here play, or, or, or do you all rap?
Coordinate and organize.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Every individual has their own potential.
This means that everyone in the band can make a whole song.
Without any help from anyone else.
But capabilities can differ; for example, if Salman is better than me,
He hears it and tells me to change the words, change something.
It is possible for each one to change into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company adopts you, until official bodies adopt these works.
And there will be real distributors.
So that the work is done in a sophisticated manner and becomes official for you.
Frankly, we were hoping for support, and we got that support from a company that came and adopted us by producing an album for us.
We don't have a problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
I mean, why don't you think the first move should come from you?
So that the individual can recognize the first CD.
By doing this, you can later attract companies, what do you think?
Around 2007, I became a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
As far as I know, because in 2007 rap might not have been widely spread in the Gulf.
But it's not popular now.
We were talking before we went on air, for example, in large groups like Valencia and Castro.
Let's talk about it?
They said they'd organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great performance.
But there was a bit of pressure because there were no advertisements and nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything before the party two days ago.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
This was a good point.
This means that our message reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal to young people only.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most of the songs.
Yes, most of the songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were a lot too.
The whole group
How does language deal with different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before*
It has to be like this.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
God willing, they will like the talk.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it mentioned the name of my program.
This is the Cat Dub and DJ GMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Lady Bobo with Qatar Telecom.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Produced by Hassan Neama, presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you all.
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it last night.
And who wrote the words, or are they?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if you write to Joseph
Not only do they write these out of love for singing, but also out of passion.
I suppose you have to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I think you can do that if you can.
Yes, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
So I think there should be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are watching a live broadcast now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
As we've seen, viewers, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The participating entities have made all preparations to host the event.
And there will be more traffic.
I suppose they'll be crowding along the corniche.
I'm sure they are ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up in the next few days?
In a gesture from a responsible party, they promised to organize a party for us.
But, still, there are some complications.
Procedures and some issues, so we're unsure.
This, we try, if you meet Joseph and see.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of implementing them.
When I am at home
Then send it to Joseph by email.
This part of the song is for Youssef.
Is there anything else? Do you travel abroad?
In this field, they have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but listen to people who are advanced in this field.
But we try to be competitors.
Why don't we take some ideas and copy some things?
But on the contrary, I take the idea and apply it in a different way to my song.
Who formed a band and has more than one CD?
A person named Abdullah Al-Dahil
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
One of the residents of Marat town.
There are many experts.
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
This requires or may involve drilling some wells where there is no water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or figs, through which he can locate water tanks.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
This was in ancient times.
But now, they have been replaced with copper rods.
So We set the two seas side by side.
Walk slowly.
We notice, when we walk along the water's course.
The sticks are going to open.
Now, we are crossing a wider watercourse.
It opens this way.
As we crossed, it starts.
Now we are in the middle of a waterway.
And here, it will be the medium.
In this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one place to find the area of greatest intensity.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
Upon reaching an advanced stage of this profession
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In March, outside March, in Shaqra, Harimlah and Al-Uthayyah.
More than one hundred and fifty wells were discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
Requires training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Mashhadani
Doha Morning Show
Marat Town, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf states, if God wills.
And we reached different places and titles, but they have their existence.
Important meaning
I suppose there is a large group of Gulf youths in the Gulf.
Do you follow specific people as role models?
To follow rather than to imitate.
In general, there is a connection between all Gulf rapists.
No competition, I mean if I produce a song.
Covers a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have connections, but no one is me.
In Saudi Arabia, in Qusay, God willing. He.
He has a fan and a CD.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you success through this team.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's watch some footage from the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
This, even if borrowed from the West, is in the Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band of twenty-five people.
It's important that we stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
If you assume that you have an email, a website, or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close without apparent reason.
I mean, we faced a lot of problems and eventually closed them.
No use, the site is definitely closing.
Well, what should we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to stay in touch with them to keep up with the news, the songs they produce from time to time.
Okay, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
Under what name
Okay, when you search for our name on Google...
Qatar's rapper or rappers in Qatar
You can produce your own video clip.
For the program, you worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded a lot of videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
I think we need to see you improve more.
You need a place where you can all gather together instead of having the equipment in each of your homes.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
Example company
Produce a CD
And he allocated us a special place.
We work for ourselves.
In the end, we're still working alone.
We don't need this.
What differs from Yusuf's speech.
We need a video clip.
And album
Video clips help spread the song quickly.
Convince ideas more quickly.
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And let your sweet voice be heard everywhere.
This is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
We see them and wish them all the best through our program, guys.
These projects were, yes.
There's also a project that's almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you already have the total and all the details.
Knows the goods instead of reading the components of each commodity.
While walking with the cart
Mounted on the cart, one can choose the material they want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings towards an issue.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza at the establishment of the center.
Maybe later, yes.
The one that takes you directly from your house to the underground train.
But I thought it was for clothes.
All shops in Qatar that sell T-shirts will appear.
Maybe later with the car key, press the button
Finds the things I've lost and leads me to the key.
Yes, let's go back to the projects the center is working on.
Early childhood education
Skills development and talent attraction
That varies depending on children's different skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we have developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with future media, we actually worked very well on this project, we reached the end, the project graduated.
We also got numbers from children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have any junior presenters?
Regarding television, it's important for them to air programs for children.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We raise them until they reach eighteen years old.
We welcome them wherever they are.
Likewise, this national television.
We need to attract, identify, and develop these talents.
Whether media or research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and diverse other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, Generation Exhibition, is also...
The scientific club played an important role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partners.
Happiness Abdullah, moving to a place like Katara,
which also embodies a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a push towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the enormous place
And it makes dealing with the public easier.
These are pioneering and excellent projects.
In welcoming the guest and introducing them to the programs offered to the child.
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted and supported this project.
It's a big project, which involves reading and development, storytelling and child nurturing.
Various cultural skills related to reading in particular
Since there are certainly different programs
We recently moved.
We are rearranging some activities.
Designed and optimized for Katara visitors
We wish you success through this center.
Contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
Most importantly, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that they...
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, his imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They ... like a hotel, the way they treat their children, they provide accommodation.
Or like a bank, it saves money.
Children really need someone to listen to their thoughts and imagination.
In the past few days, they transported us to the year 2030.
At this exhibition
Good luck to the winning projects.
Thank you for being here, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
Until these projects become a reality and are not just a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center was inaugurated last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing Ceremony of the National Exhibition of Dreams of Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, dear sister.
First, I'd like to thank you for giving us the time.
To talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you here on the program to cover as much of the exhibition's activities as possible.
This is the national exhibition of the dreams of a generation.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
Contribution from the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
Who had *
In an attempt to calm the children
Live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So we narrowed it down to twenty or thirty.
And other key areas in Qatar's Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then consider the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you mean exactly by this phrase?
Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow
I mean, anything a child dreams of today, will be a reality tomorrow.
He's growing the project as he goes along.
In fact, this was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children would live from this day forward.
I dream big.
Whether it's environmental, health, human development, or any other field
This serves the country.
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available via
At the exhibition, there were also guest speakers.
For children to learn from, as role models.
Yesterday, or a day or two ago, there was *
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
A very bright idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, in four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is the colored ball.
It was also called the Smart Stadium.
As soon as the ball goes out of bounds.
Colors differ.
I assume in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
And after all these dreams
And he sticks to matters related to his field of interest.
I assume, especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects into account from small minds.
But who knows, maybe these projects will serve us, what does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Wade visited football-related projects.
He supported and adopted these projects as soon as he saw them.
And also these projects are built.
Our children did, people also voted for many projects.
So, what were the projects on the ground that received the most votes from people?
In an evaluation committee, they have a method for evaluating projects.
The first, second, and third prize-winning projects
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, it needs many administrative elements.
There were very detailed explanations in the booklet distributed to visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we see now.
These are some of the big projects.
Perhaps they don't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
And indeed, part of it is adopted by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
To reduce, reuse, and recycle.
From two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Majid, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will be hosting a very dear guest.
From the series "Al-Musalsal Al-Tsa'if", the actor Abdelhamid Charsheni.
He asserts himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent."
They worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
"Which means"
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I admire the show's cast and crew.
We'll show you a very short clip of your work, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you messing with me?
Take the fake bisht and keep the real pocket.
Go and get it.
You have the cloak, you return it.
What? Give me the best, I'll return it! How do I return it?
The goat ground it in his belly a long time ago, alas.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't agree to that.
I have no objections.
So this is a quick glimpse, a very short clip from the series "Classifications" whose second part we will watch.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles in the series "Categories" which covers a different topic in each episode?
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I passed by Mary at that time.
Mart is known for its proximity to the mountain as well.
The comet celebrated by poets throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
That shows the antiquity of her history.
One hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And some believe it was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the moderation of its air.
Poets drew inspiration from her and admired her, and she was famous for her renowned mountain, "Comet."
They call it Comet Valley.
Of course, Marath City is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam
There were some ancient things with unknown history like the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we're in now.
The great companion Khalid bin Waleed (may Allah be pleased with him), during the period of the Ridda Wars, ordered the digging of this well.
It's still remaining.
The proverb says, "Put Comet in trust, and I'll put you in my trust."
If you see a comet, you can see Mars.
Another effect is the Comet Valley.
It is a sweet and bitter flow over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of the establishment of these ruins is unknown.
There is still the bride, and there is still more.
Mount Komit is one of the landmarks of the city of Maraat.
There were many proverbs, poems, and odes built upon this mountain.
Many people come to him from all over the kingdom.
One of its most important monuments is the Al-Waleedi Well.
This is because he remained in Muradh during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamamah.
He camped there and ordered the men to dig this well.
Two peoples still drink from its water and wash in it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed by Marrah.
It is an old house made of mud that has been restored to its original state.
It consists of diverse sections reflecting the architecture, heritage, and archaeology of the region.
The poet said of her: "When we met water, it was the water of generosity."
We crossed the Comet Valley, not the Anjel Valley.
Professor Ayman, cooperation, God willing, between the family, guardians, and the center as well as the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Since whatever comes to us, whether it's an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains all his complete personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, he has an evaluation every month.
We were responsible for the "Aqool" program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
Guardian through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he reach it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he joined the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a structure.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
We see different models, I wish we had enough space.
However, we brought a model of a girl.
You'll see different tests before you go live.
We ask her math questions and various questions.
We'll take a short break and be right back with this smart girl, stay with us.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If any show from the first, second, or third ring catches his attention, if he feels uninterested in the show he'll use the remote.
He won't bother, he has twenty thousand other things to do.
Correct, twenty thousand series, that's right.
Twenty thousand ringgit. Some people don't focus on one job.
He can see the other job.
You're right, that's mostly it.
He claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, our dear and honored guest, Abdel Hamid Charshani.
Would you like to say something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I tell them, hopefully every year finds you in good health and well-being.
It's true that we don't go out much, don't appear much, and don't do much for the reason I mentioned before.
Next time will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you success in this year's work.
If God wills, we'll have another meeting with you to discuss these plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are eagerly awaited by trend lovers.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Sabah Doha. We are live with you.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have registered at this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing the other capability.
And to make their minds work fully.
Mrs. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khaleg are the General Managers of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome aboard.
And with us is the beautiful Amanya, good morning Amanya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Whatever God's will, we wish you all the best.
What things are available for our children?
It has been clarified with Professor Ayman and Professor Nesma, and he has been specifically directed in the interest of our children.
"Mental Math Minds" program
Finger counting and abacus.
To achieve specific goals, we tried to present a small part of it.
Did you feel, Professor Ibrahim, that there was indeed a difference for the student on his first two days?
And after he finishes, maybe three or four months?
Whether taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
In short, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
Which one reveals lost potential or needs further development?
And he reached a specific level or what updates happened to the boy?
I mean, we work in a scientific way, a scientific program.
What are some of the methods and mechanisms that are regularly applied?
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amany is one of the students who joined this center.
We were planning to do a live stream today to show our viewers the importance of these things.
If you want to take the coat, I don't mind.
This is a very quick episode and a small part of the "Classifications" series, of which we will watch the second part.
But as we saw, this part of the series is a sequel to the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Classifications," where each episode tackles a different topic?
This year, focus on doing it.
Negligent Favor
Who encourages by giving opportunities
Sixteen episodes in two seasons.
A director appears in an episode, and in an episode, an old woman appears, and in an episode, a baker appears.
So, it's a series of episodes.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
I can't remember many actors now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Rashid and Mohamed Adel.
Flew, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We have a few things going on in Qatar right now. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that as well?
Qatar Television provided an executive producer.
Qatar TV did its best, but there is only one production per year and all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series, and all the actors in Qatar want to work on it.
I mean, if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
Alright, let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdul Aziz Jasim from the series Al-Hukm Al-Insani, after the dispersion even yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in the theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for radio and television.
For it is He who has nurtured us, taught us, and created us.
Then Mr. Ghaniem entered the entertainment industry and made his best effort in the year 2000 in the program "Faez Al-Tosh".
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two works a year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you, my dear friend.
Deadly emotions are also produced by Tara arts.
The director of the series is Mr. Monir %PW.
We're back with you, our dear viewers, and today we will talk about reflexology.
The message is from the palm, the hand's sole.
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The exam format is as follows.
Swelling, degree of pain.
You can feel inside the hand that there's something like sand or shattered veins inside the hand.
Loosen your grip.
My friend's brother has nervous tension.
You feel some pressure and a bit of tension, tension.
The left side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health issue will become apparent, we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there pain here?
Pain means problem.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses and the ear.
"Do you have a sinus problem or any problem before that?"
I had surgery, but that was a long time ago.
Is it the almond or something else?
His weight is increasing without eating.
Alright, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him he had nervous tension.
Ten years ago, he was walking barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think they empty out.
Any uneven land is not just a sea.
Negative energy possible %PW.
He might be shocked that you discovered these things through the massage.
Of course, the kids are the most important.
Kids, praise be to God. This is for the mother, pay attention to me!
He is harmed by the milk and food he eats.
Her son matches up with her, she picks him up and the boy closes his eyes by himself.
Lock your hand.
Just a little bit stressed, thank God.
He'll get it in a few seconds and the boy will be happy. First, he'll be in pain from the hurt here.
Later, you'll see gases suddenly rising.
What are your findings, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing is for menstrual pain or period pain in general.
She needs to focus on a rock or stone, by pressing here, you give orders Subhan Allah to the lower back and menstrual problems. If you have pain, ...
God willing, it will disappear in seconds.
Pregnant woman
Delivery became easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her she can give birth in the seventh month, she might be able to give birth in the ninth.
Except on sand.
If you walk on sand, no problem, but if you walk on rocks, no.
She has to eat seven fresh dates for breakfast; fresh dates are better.
If she doesn't have sugar dates, regular dates will do.
As Allah the Almighty says: "I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan," My discoveries from the Quran.
This means that God could not make these soft dates reach her, no, He was not incapable.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word 'I'.
She has to bring small rocks or balls.
Labor bed. For example, if you forget and end up on the labor bed, hold onto the handles.
You'll notice in private hospitals, a lone East Asian woman comes.
Understood, this is a common exercise in East Asia.
No need, you have my number.
Only the mobile!
To cooperate with each other, I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Make charity a habit and also pay attention to other people. You were created to worship God and then take care of people.
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I have no religion or sheikh; I'm an ordinary person.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful meeting, and also thank our dear guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak more about this.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
Is the program part of the national strategy to combat obesity?
Around four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are Gulf states.
Of course, we have launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other entities to combat obesity.
Fear of its spreading more and more soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize this competition together, making it an international one.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the week that follows.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because this is the first stage where they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about what your favorite fruit is.
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! The more you walk, the more points he gets.
This is a map of Qatar, and whenever someone gets points, they walk and their school moves forward and their class moves forward.
This creates a healthy competition among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, not Pepsi.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink a lot of Pepsi every time you feel thirsty, just drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
At school, in some games that some people can't stand,
We're looking for a sport he likes.
So we can force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And her family knows that they should allow their child to eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so that we can take.
Of course, this is a model, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more expertise in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we enjoyed a lot with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin has improved, and acne has decreased.
This is true, this is true and becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And their peers in different classes ask them, "How are you?" and they learn from their peers.
Praise be to God, the spread has begun that many schools are eager to participate next year.
Inshallah.
Qtel was the official sponsor supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On the dining table.
Praise be to God for these many authorities, some of which I have mentioned and some I have missed.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And the rest, the brothers used to arrange in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
This is the future generation.
To generalize this experience or disseminate it as widely as possible in Qatar.
When you evaluate, there's something you need to fix.
After its widespread use and satisfactory results,
Inshallah we will spread because there are people asking why we weren't present.
Eat, eat healthy food and you'll get there, you don't have a problem.
If we start at a young age, we will reach what we want by our twenties or mid-twenties.
You mentioned a series of titles, each group had a title.
If we return, we'll try in our segment today to be about closing events,
And when we mentioned people again in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's repeat and review the information for each week that we want to convey to the student.
Alright, the first thing of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
So he began to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think that walking is only for the elderly, but why should young people walk?
So when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it relaxes your body and mind.
It makes it easier for the individual, meaning that the process of mental clarity improves.
I took the students on excursions.
Yes, they were all required to walk barefoot, both at home and at school.
Their points are recorded by the classroom teacher.
We used to walk every day.
This was an event, some people held a march, the girls' school held a march.
We want them to love this, being creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want them to give them ideas to stick to.
Everyone has their skill in this matter.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We constantly try to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and cravematchmat
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can find out his favorite sport and encourage him in it,
He is interested in sports.
He loves sports by practicing them; he practices sports unconsciously.
We mentioned earlier that we would talk about the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Allow me to welcome our guest for today who is joining us in the studio.
Thank you.
We're happy to have you here at this show.
And part of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
It affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The time period ranges from twenty to forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the reason that causes someone to get this disease is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from all harm and other diseases.
This disease is an infection of the brain and spinal cord nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
What reaches the point of no neural signal arrival, weakens or is cut off.
Leads to paralysis, may Allah protect us and you.
No, despite the advancements in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Okay, what's the solution? We want to know how to reach it.
Similarly, one must also have protection against this thing.
The main reason is quality of life, the nature of food or life cycles?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to contract this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All these topics may be somewhat controversial in society.
So far, we know his reasons.
Okay, the age group that can be affected by this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to calm down with the person.
So far, we haven't been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar as well.
In the recent period, just last week, I was informed of three to four diagnosed infected cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, which is what is recorded in the files.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go to other countries for treatment.
Alright, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any effects like someone getting sick from this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they are suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, is deadly.
We should be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
When giving a specific reason related to a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
