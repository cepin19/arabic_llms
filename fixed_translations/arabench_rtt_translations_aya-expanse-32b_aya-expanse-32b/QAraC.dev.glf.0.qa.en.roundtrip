If my brother is blind
He refuses to improve himself and improve those around him.

No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street

And you're starving.
Are you eating or not?
No, I will eat.
Tell me, did he accept it?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I'm fed up with him.
This is our chance, our cars are shamefully old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These are ordinary and natural things.
Stupid! Lacks self-confidence.
Ha, scared?
What really gets on my nerves.
So he is responsible for the budget.
What project is he in charge of?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Oh Mother, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
Which means I will
I consider myself a participant!
I can't not take anything from her.
I won't take anything?
This means I'm involved too.
We all have to take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
In a word
The good that you reject.
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like what the others do.
A feast of luck lies before you.
Take your share.
He had barely a single penny in his pocket.
I heard him myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the third and last is plunder.
His son is healthy.
Went to Souq Waqif
It cost him one lantern eight riyals.
They budgeted for it.
At one hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
You get bored of him.
Seek refuge from the Accursed Satan.
Yeah, but I think he's changing his mind.
God willing!
He is the chairman of the board and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We need to be together.
A government project like this represents an opportunity.
Sure, Ali!
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
And if God wills, everyone will be included in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was chatting with our foursome.
From your side
We are not concerned because you are members of the project committee.
We are worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your friends not to be afraid.
"By God, Abu Fahd?"
This is a good omen.
But, Saud, don't forget!
No, no
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
Let this be valid until the first.
Get rid of it.
I was wondering if I'd get some benefits.
Is this possible?
Then, you're involved in the project since you work with us in the same department.
But most importantly, it should remain a secret between us.
I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
I will definitely do it.
Good appetite.
What's wrong with you!
If you keep daydreaming like that,
It's not going to work.
This isn't going to work.
Or questions
If you need help, we'll be happy to provide it.
How will we get our share?
Or is it logical?
His name!
Thus we are not the only ones who will take.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We're the ones who set the budget.
What land did he buy today?
Did he also just find it?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
He called me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "Is there something?"
Tell your brother.
That other land
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He said please call him to confirm if he wants it, I'll book it for him.
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
Where's our money?
We are considered accomplices with him.
Even if we weren't involved!
You eat a big mouthful by yourself.
At least give some to your brother and mother.
I'm not here to beg you.
Since we're also participating in the project, we have the right to claim our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when Sultan came and asked for his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking to them.
They bring in their brothers and friends.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't want just limited money.
Paid-in capital.
That his brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wishes.
It seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you.
Ah, Abu Saleh
Your wife's brother!
He's going to like it.
The project benefits from it.
We reminded ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh!
I'll be responsible for cement, bricks, and concrete.
And the rest, from water to electricity, is on me.
Oh people!
Claim your share / Take your portion.
I, by God,
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take anything you want in any way you prefer.
The most important thing,
We, too,
Even during this week,
Everyone determines the amount they want.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
Ask for more than one hundred thousand.
Alright, but why?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your job in looting, ignore him.
There are also the orphans' funds.
Or increase the budget.
Many people love food.
Who does he think he is?
Expose this! This is your father's project!
Yes, this is Sultan.
Oh brother! Oh ruler!
It means he is involved.
Is this the last name?
Your friend Saud has many names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's take advantage of them."
I mean, in which group should I add it, as a percentage or a monetary amount?
No, put him with the beggars.
How much should you allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
By God, enough.
Until they add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of that will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one will notice it.
Ah, there's also my mom's list that she sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Haha, may she live long.
My eye, my son.
Please, God, she is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
Take care, I told you this is the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
Ha! Yes, wait, wait... How much is enough for you?
Enough for the liver, lodging, and hospital!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers are you going to transplant!
One, but my sister is expensive.
Yes, please, add her name to the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Give her some of your money!
Reassure him and tell him that I won't take anything from phase two.
Okay, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh man! They're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Two thousand
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
I can make you feel embarrassed in front of your friends!
No, Mother.
I have a lot of things to do.
Later, I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the feast increased.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
You are free.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
They give us salaries regularly.
How! We want to know!
They give it to us all at once or in installments.
Why does she get more than us?
In a power outage or in a raid, what matters, the important thing is to stay quiet, we are waiting for them to come.
He tells you to be quiet, you tell him to be quiet.
Don't be ashamed.
If I hear any of you speaking
Sew his mouth shut.
They kept us locked up for a very long time.
You know this is money, not easy/simple.
What was its price before?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss after all.
We don't want a headache.
They agreed on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, through your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a very important project and also full of enthusiasm.
And not just for this generation
OK
Tomorrow is the opening of the first phase of the project.
We thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
And I am welcome.
On this occasion
United Nations
Where to? To the project.
Where are we headed!
I don't know where we are.
Disgusted
Don't you see the officials speaking and the people applauding them?
We are at the official opening, and what do you have?
Okay, now talk, that means we're in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people are sweating profusely.
And these divisions, I don't know what they're putting inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
Official Opening of International Beaches
3rd century AD, what's wrong with you?
I really don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they isolated me.
He just parks his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I personally saw it, on a large farm over there.
Alhamdulillah, you are comfortable.
You receive checks while comfortably at home.
Why are you bothering yourself, Munira? Don't let anyone mess with your mind!
You should thank your lucky stars, Manira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Sager.
Focus on your share and invest it.
Here, meet my friend Hia.
Her sisters don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't act like that.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... You don't trust us!
I don't know.
I feel satisfied with my brother Rashid's words.
He always reminds me of the check they give me every three months.
But, this is true.
He always tells me.
Don't you trust us?
Financial and inheritance matters must be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied, it's okay.
Do you know what he does to people?
And Umm Salama is a role model for you, the poor thing.
Who would believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But business is business, and it's your legitimate right.
And then?
And we run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headache.
She said she was walking on the ground, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
Any problem?
Your sister is starting to spin.
This is the problem.
She's planning to drag us into trouble.
This is a way of giving her money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We should find a solution to this, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity I receive every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they aren't investing the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said they would give her more so she would be happy and stop asking questions.
You're completely right.
Give it to me little by little.
If you only see their wives.
She has a lot of different diamond jewelry.
And I don't have the text they have.
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
This is yours.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are stealing from me and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is unpredictable, dear!
They tortured me, they exhausted me, oh my God, my beloved!
Don't they know there's an account and a reckoning?
And that Allah will punish them for wrongfully taking people's money.
And beware, don't mention anything to them about the court, my dear!
They will be happy.
Is it because of our growing population?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a skyscraper.
I just want my rights.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And give to the poor.
Um Soliman
Keep calm, my love!
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are violated.
You were interrogating the accountant.
Who are you!! He asks.
Answer them!
No, I am not. I am here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't frown.
Do you know the door you entered from?
No, no
No falcon.
That's unfortunate, Saad.
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we don't have a problem with that.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure he's her evil husband.
Just as it is good.
Just as I'm begging them.
This is a well-known and established legal principle.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
This isn't working.
Expect anything, Manira!
My parents' company
Eight buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
And he says only six hundred thousand.
By signing the waiver document
No oh! Munira
Don't be rash and sign that paper, be careful, I warn you.
This is your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else, not on them.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You've just been fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
Is this your father's company?
Don't you see him screaming?
"Come in, I tell you."
Leave it, there's no need.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, make him stop.
We apologize.
My brother Saad went to the office and explained to them, they don't know.
Come inside.
See if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink.
Please come in.
Certainly %pw
You're getting us into trouble.
She discovers how much she has.
He discovers that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's calculate it.
In ninety-six months,
Here's the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million, five hundred twenty thousand
Normal, what does that mean?
Let him do what he can.
Frankly, I'm telling him.
This is our money.
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
Excuse me.
This is the accountant, Samer.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser might have.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go get it, take it.
Let him see all the files.
You're supposed to take more than ten million.
What they mentioned until now
She was saying, "Poor thing."
That her father left.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
God suffices us for everything, and He is the Disposer of affairs, my child!
They don't do what is fair.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Mother of Selma?
I have to sue them, there's no other option.
He glances through a few papers.
The case was postponed.
Beware, my son, Nasser!
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh, ma'am! You're here while the doctor is looking for you.
Wake up, Mother of Salma.
Go to your room.
All the Muslim patients
He didn't tell me.
Sorry, who's speaking?
Ah, I remember you now, ah, I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
As for why, my brother!
Don't worry, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
She thinks that this Abdullah whom she sent to them can...
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, for years past.
Can you trust Mona?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
What are those who live seventy or eighty years?
This is for people who live at least two hundred years.
Umm Salama, may Allah have mercy on her.
May God have mercy on her, she used to say.
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do they have to *mummify* us to consult the court?
This is it.
By God, are you hanging out with them?
Successful, God willing
By the way, he's a friend from school days.
Life is short.
And I ask for your benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And it is deeply rooted.
Perhaps, Rashid, we are friends.
Please go while I'm still calm.
Or you'll be left behind.
Leave it, I forgot the friendship thing.
Are you going out or what?
I paid one hundred and ninety thousand on a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibit.
Where did she get all this money from?
They squander money on their wives.
They deprive their sisters of their wealth.
Do you still have hope, Nasser!
Fight with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you to do.
Well-known families with deep roots
Maybe, why not?
But, I also suggest
O Allah, bless this conversation with these bright faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with what is good for us in this life and the Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say, don't bring up the issue of my sister's share.
This is true.
It's better for you to go, or you'll be beaten.
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
What matters to me.
Going tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Do not listen to her.
You're not going to court.
The day after tomorrow
I'll give you a chance to see what you want to do.
Goodbye
Kindness doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
God willing, we'll see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, as we are going to visit her tomorrow.
What is this?
You're right.
I asked why?
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance
By God, she did it.
May God give you a sweet life.
May your life be complete.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first park your car in the parking lot.
You'll see the security guards.
You go to the eighth floor.
Judges in this role
Business cards of all the lawyers in the country
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here, you're laughing at us.
We want her to sue us.
The spirit of the court.
Listen to Manar.
Sign a waiver for us.
The beautiful one.
Know the way
We showed you the way.
Come on, dear.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is the Al Raya newspaper for today.
There's a good article ahead.
It was written by a woman; I think she's a doctor.
I want you to take a look, as a gift *from me*
His living conditions must be changed.
This is unfortunate.
He has four children, but his home is unhappy.
Surely he will, he risks all his wealth.
Invest in this project.
The person I would never expect to start a project is Bou Waleed.
Eat, eat, you children of the new merchant, Bou and Walid.
My love, shall I prepare something for you to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, grab some fruit.
Mom, I want a toy like Hamad's.
Bon appétit
My son Waleed put some candy aside for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed. You deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Oh father, when we become big merchants, I want my own room.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll get you a large BlackBerry.
Forget their wishes now.
Like everyone else.
Instead of our miserable little house.
First, let's pay off all our debts, and then we'll see.
You look very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, lucky he is.
My father's merchant hair.
May God bless the project.
Save some for my friends.
If God wills, God bless you.
I met a Japanese person; he was among them.
While we were sitting, I switched places with him, he gave me a gift catalog.
Later, one of my friends saw him.
He said: It's an opportunity.
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like that
These are computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want a playground..
This is magic.
They put on their finery, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, some of my relatives, sold some of my land, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has agreed,
Why didn't you request it since the ministry approved it?
And then an email is sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
Thyme tea
Nothing, I'm still waiting in Ali's office.
"And the secretary didn't call, brother."
And stay away for ten days.
A matter of luck
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Are you a fully accredited manager?
Why don't you go to him to sign for you?
I told you he can't.
It is what it is, all the employees there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving at times.
You should thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Are you done?
How can I finish this when Abu Fahd never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
His father signs as quickly as possible so we can finish; I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say that as his secretary. What about us?
And give me your mobile number.
I am the secretary. Please sit down, sit down. Is it him? What's wrong with him?
Don't call, you scare people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, my money for fixing the toilet
He is stupid.
Oh people, wait, wait!
Quiet, quiet,
He told you to be quiet, enough, shut up.
Boo Fahd had to leave for the airport.
How did he manage to do that?
Let's meet him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
Good health to you.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear!
But he behaves strangely.
And when he receives the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
She needs it now.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
Here, in front of you.
You call me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
I have no choice, my daughter.
I know, father, but this isn't fair.
The class starts next week at the university.
If I don't register, I'll have to wait until next semester.
Three months will be a waste of time.
My love, I'm trying.
Don't you see me going to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
I'll stay at home.
I don't understand!
Don't call me at lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
Inshallah, Bu Fahad will sign the papers this week.
And they give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
He wakes up in a panic.
He sleeps walking and talks to himself all night.
If Bu Fahd falls,
God helps him.
Therefore,
It's necessary for Bu Fahd to sign this paper this week.
And what is he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And he traveled for a year.
And leave the comfort of the people.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how is this?
Do you feel better now?
I'm completely infatuated.
This strange heat is killing me, it's going up and down.
What does he want?
I heard I'm going to the ministry.
To prepare my transactions
He told the staff that he would teach me a lesson.
The time is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
This is Bu Fahd's secretary.
I'd like to tell you that
Abu Fahd will come tomorrow, God willing.
As soon as I call you,
Come right away.
Clearly beautiful
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on the screen of your mobile phone.
I said, "That's forbidden by God."
Until you feel responsible.
And if you adhere
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing
Poor him.
The manager punishes him.
He's bringing it with us.
Have you heard about the factory?
He'll lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes and tells the manager.
Hell, yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
"I'll take care of the matter, but let it slide."
Bu Waleed
I'm going, but I'm waiting for a phone call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, people! Wait, people! Wait!
How am I supposed to know where he's going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
We are going to look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley
I'm sorry.
Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
Where have you been, Abu Saeed, for so long!
What were you thinking?
About fourteen years.
As a messenger
A headache like this
Sweating without air conditioning in past years.
Did you think riding a bike was easy before?
With a yellow mark
It was a very tough time, O Abu Saeed!
Disaster, my son!
But what can we do, child of Adam?
This is Saad.
Alright, sorry guys, the manager has arrived as he said he would. Let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived, sweethearts! Get moving!
Congratulations, Abu Saeed.
They said your son, Khalid, has been hired.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Bathroom thief
I told you when my last son graduates, I'm going to quit.
Graduated and got a job.
Alhamdulillah, I'm finishing my work.
The service was well provided.
Praise be to God.
Change your mind, Abu Saeed!
And you deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz!
I'm very grateful, Abu Abdulaziz!
Hey you!
We did our duty.
Let them finish the trip.
This is yours.
After all this age and work
Means all running back and forth.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed!
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
Celebration of my retirement
A coffee pot and some dates, how wonderful!
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry because of Khanfarsh, O Abu Saeed!
Don't worry.
Ready-made carpet
Yes, surely, goodbye.
I told you the cannoli is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
This is your chance to submit it today.
He told me that their manager would travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't want to move until
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye.
Congratulations to me.
No more work.
That means you're free, Father.
Alright, please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zohra is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
Let's get a cake.
I can't.
I myself sent my father to do some errands for me.
The flower is sad.
Present, Mother.
My father quit his job.
God helps him now.
He has done his share, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khanefrash.
I prepared it.
I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
I tired this old man.
As soon as he came back,
He was tired.
Don't bother me about them (singing).
Don't bother me about them (singing).
I was going to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said he would punish anyone who was late.
Sure, my love.
Go to your job.
With this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
Sends you to a place every day.
As you wish, Mother Saeed.
Smell
In my nose
"Snail seller, snail seller"
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, take it to the branches in the market.
And go there.
Sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me it's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
The sun hit.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what's up.
Why did you force me to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat khanefrash now.
Mom, where's Dad?
Back and forth
She told him to go to any bank.
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Oh my god, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, is he better?
I slept a bit, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
These are poor, Um Saeed.
They have to commit to their work, they are being evaluated, what can they do?
As you like it.
This translates to
You could say I retired, but I didn't.
How did it happen?
Before, in the past,
The poor girl is destined for me.
Your children are grown up.
I need to help them.
They used to tell me
You're wrong.
Do all young people without a father not complete their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they let you go to finish your personal work.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Zion?
I'm filling out some papers for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this cafe
By taking him to the Land Offices
Goodbye
"What's wrong, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye."
This is not going to do you any good.
I warn you.
I heard you say this to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
What matters to me about you.
If your father complains
He is silent.
And don't talk about it.
You've tired him out, fear God.
Your very loud screaming woke me up from sleep.
Father, you were a government employee and know very well what hoarding means.
And this is the first time they write it.
And now they are %pw, they do this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Alright, my son.
I believed his lies.
He says he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
As you like it
Walk now to finish his work.
There's nothing, there's nothing.
He's been silent since he came back home.
He doesn't answer me.
You have no shame at all.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree with this.
Waid, may God reward you with good.
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling his servant?
You are the most respected among us, O father!
Thank you, I appreciate it.
May God forgive you, and may He be pleased with you.
Let me fix it.
From now on, my father!
And relax.
Khanfaresh Khanfaresh (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, O Father!
God has decreed good for you.
We've decided from now on,
We'll do our own paperwork.
Thank you very much everyone, may Allah reward you, praise be to Allah.
But, father, may God be pleased with you.
Consider it the last.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Dad, I'm not going to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister is upset with you.
No, no, no, that's not possible. You can't upset the minister. You have to go, even before him.
I won't go any further, what should I tell you, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider it done.
It'll be on your way, when you finish Saeed's papers.
Well done, dad.
Consider this your last resort.
I'm happy to serve you, Father!
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
Do you mean I should give it back to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
And when they see the papers
You'll wait for two months.
Don't give it to me until he signs it and I'll return it to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and ask him to come, just two minutes.
With it
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Every time I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He is said to be with Saeed.
I'm waiting until the work day is over.
Okay, my dear.
Why did you come to complete your papers yourself?
Why didn't you send your kids?
Don't you have kids?
Are you well, Professor?
Come on, dad, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I'm going to leave you.
And go to the old people's home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What will you tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'm writing something else.
Praise be to God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
What is my sister really?
Why bother?
I told him never to appear on TV or radio.
The phrase "cutting corruption" led us to disaster.
May God guide him to the right path.
Come on, sister, goodbye, may God protect you.
Did he go to prison?
I was far away.
What can I tell you?
The program called Myles, I think.
Talk to the boy.
Khaled Jassem
And I said to him, "Enough corruption!"
His colleagues at work heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
No one from his friends
Those who encouraged him to do that,
I left it.
May God guide him to the right path.
Sorry, I have to go cook now.
Hello anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and fed up with this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, mother.
Sorry to hear that happened.
I told you about this.
What's this, mom?
And they shouted.
This is the sermon.
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
But we don't talk about him.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
That's sad, after all these years, you're firing me.
Don't listen.
Stop corruption.
One more time, please.
Yes, Saleh.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well-versed in information
We've just expelled a small number of people.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Done, goodbye.
A good brother
Inshallah, your uncle, Abu Manira, doesn't find out about this.
He's been mad at you.
Who knows?
If he asks you
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they'd fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he was still working.
Certainly, translation.
His mother must say that today.
What should we do with it now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
Whatever you see is right.
I'll give him two weeks.
But if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divorce my daughter from him.
Drink your coffee.
You're not going to get anywhere unless you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to go outside.
You are suspended from the game.
I know you're excited about
Go to the coffee shop.
Until you talk nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Oh Mother, I told you, I've quit this habit.
I swear by God.
Mom, to be honest, I'm feeling a bit bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act as if you were deaf.
Change.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your talks about fighting corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Salih is present!
Surely sleeping
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the cafe.
What did he say?
Do the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around us.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it was your mistake,
It's his fault because he didn't stop you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Whether we speak or not, we give a stop to corrupt conversations or not.
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on a radio program.
O Saleh, stop the corruption.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a high sense of patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming. We appreciate it.
Not true
I look forward every day to hearing her say, "Stop the corruption."
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Say it just once.
May God bless you, I
Is this a cigarette? Just say stop corruption, may God have mercy on you.
He's begging you, just do it for him, just once.
This is amazing.
Now, my dear
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and you are very dear to us.
We wanted to contact you to let you know.
He was embarrassing you in front of people.
Grandfather?
They all said there were no vacancies.
They wanted to hire me, but there were no open positions.
And now, how are you going to save money for you and your mother?
And don't forget this.
And she has four children.
Good health to you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I won't say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
But you, you never listen to me.
"May God guide you."
I can't go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister is going to think about it.
Surely he thinks so.
You're right.
But, the matter is serious.
We need to do something.
They say he's going to replace you. You know such a rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind this.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh stopping corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He finishes her.
We miss your voice.
No good
I'm a big fan of yours.
Saleh is a good man.
And God willing, soon.
He comes back, and we keep hearing his voice.
Bo Fahad himself is asking about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you resign?
I had some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are a hard worker.
I haven't heard from her in a long time.
Oh, please reconcile.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, people, it's too difficult.
What's wrong with you?
The man is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I have already resigned.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Be persistent and let him hear your voice, then go to him the next day and ask for a job.
He'll definitely hit you on the head.
I want you to benefit.
Do you know what?
Forget about it, go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Alright, young man, wait a bit. Let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
"تم ت
Alright, if you've spoken for the last time now, I might leave but I'll do it one last time,
What does Bou Fahd like to hear?
What's the problem that concerns him the most? You know, there are many problems here, far too many.
And what does he like to listen to? He doesn't like trouble, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Eighty-seven inches = centimeter
Ruined it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is issue seven? Issue seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Issue Seven, His Excellency the Minister
Why did the employee
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
His brother's car garage
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a proud people, so this is the last time.
Because frankly, I resigned.
Mother, didn't you say he resigned and that you fired him?
Yes, by God, my daughter.
Yes, by God, my daughter.
The man who is said to have stopped corruption was talked about on the radio.
I haven't heard about it, but some people told me.
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
He was free from it.
He is free.
Present, Your Excellency the Minister
Don't worry.
A full day dedicated to serving the ministry, God bless you.
Did you hear him?
I only said it for you.
Ignore me.
Didn't talk to me.
Abdulrahman told me he would get me a job with him.
Didn't talk to me.
Oh Saleh, you are very poor.
I pity you.
I am Bu Fahad's secretary.
And I know the case.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached her.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
Was behind all this
Bu Fahad will never hire you.
You're doing the same thing to him.
As long as you're known.
No one is hiring you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow, for divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free from any problems
No, what are we doing?
We never have problems.
We are pleased.
What is nepotism?
Everyone stands in line.
Because that's the system here.
Let him take his rights more than the foreigner.
We don't rely on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your effort and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important official
And he will expel you.
We don't have that here.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Known as anti-corruption
I didn't want to have dinner.
I was running and pulling on my shirt and tore it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Waleed saw the t-shirt we bought from Villaggio on him just now.
He pulled it jealously and tore it.
He's kind-hearted, he can't bear to blame anyone.
I think
Alas! Adoul saw my son was handsome and started envying him.
What concerns him is in this matter.
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
You saw him wearing a new shirt and envied him, ask your father to buy you a new one.
What's your opinion?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you.
Don't make me hit you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face and disfigure him?
This is a small child, not your age, have some shame.
Is this a child?
Yes, he is a child.
People need to raise and fix him.
Not just the left.
Beware of your words, Sultan!
You think I'm a child because you want to fix me.
You are arrogant.
I raised my son well.
And if you are unable to do that
I respect him.
I don't want to upset him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adel hits Waleed again,
I'll punish him.
It's me who wastes my time arguing with you.
Act like a human being.
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools.
Where have the past days gone?
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is bigger.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the problem we're in.
Oh, my dear, tell me what happened.
Brother Ahmed, I'm sorry, I have to go home, there's an emergency and I must go.
Adoul's pants are gone.
He is a resentful and hateful person.
This is Sultan.
How does the boy cut through all these clothes?
God forbid, I didn't use them, God forbid.
Buried
Sit down, listen to me.
If I go and talk to him, he won't confess. He'll say, "This boy..."
This, what do we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yes, by God, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, my dear?
Under his bed.
Destroy them, may God destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I won't be silent.
He is crazy, insane.
For a while
And do not change it.
But computers are a different story, I'll tell you.
I won't be silent.
Do you think our Walid is the one who broke their device?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this story.
Don't do it.
Go mock someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you his name is Adoul.
And laugh at someone else, oh! Tigers, not on me.
Live, come please.
The hearts were pure.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm going to go look for friends.
They laugh at me, not on me, oh! Sultan!
Falsely accused
Hold this pair of scissors.
Mind your own business.
Hello, Abdel Rahman, come quickly, my son!
Come see your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, my son!
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We should be.
Think carefully about our actions.
The works of our predecessors
Let's see.
It will be a lesson for us.
We should learn from them.
Don't behave like children like this.
As big as a camel.
Do you have kids?
With zero knowledge
You are a role model for him, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, O Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
For me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
I greeted him.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
From Abdurrahman's endless chatter
Where are you going?
I swear to God I won't let him.
Did you make this tea?
Come out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
You didn't tell us if Abdulrahman settled your dispute with him?
But I swear to God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll break into his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
Bouré, hold the tea.
On his head
Be quiet, be quiet, enough... You children, where is your shame, you're hitting each other!
You're behaving like little children, stop it, my son!
I swear to God I'll show you.
Hit, hit, oh my god! Oh my son, your belly is so big!
Blood, Mother
You scared me with your shouting.
Oh God!
Leave us alone.
This is ridiculous.
Although I had reconciled you.
I won't let you go.
When he came at night to reconcile them
He doesn't have time, my daughter!
Poor him.
Inshallah
Speaks fluently
But, oh! Girls
"May God guide you."
You need to calm them down.
Don't provoke them to fight each other, girls!
What's happening? God willing, it's good.
You disappointed me, Abdurrahman!
I wanted your help, not you to do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, my son, I ask God to guide you.
Two hits in a row.
Stretch out your arm.
Shame on you, may God guide you.
Our neighbor, happy, is laughing at you.
Officer! We've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, all three of them.
Sorry
Don't do it.
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from the window*.
Did you hear him?
This means it's very far away.
My brother was right when he said that %pw.
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed that your children won't do it again,
Thank you, thank you.
Hello brother, hello
Officer, how are you going to prove it? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't mean to say that in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is he the assistant undersecretary?
Al-Wasatani is the head of a general authority.
Take two Panadol and rest.
Benadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
God protects him from evil.
God protects him from evil.
God protect me from the enemy, they exhaust me.
What is this? * What's the ratio?
Dad throws that far!
This is the hand of one adult, it seems to be his father's.
Can you believe it?
He seems to be from a respectable family, quiet and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
What does it mean?
Follows you
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say you don't have a chance.
When I passed by her, she looked at you, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same time.
No, but there must be something.
I notice when you enter.
She seems genuinely happy.
Go ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, believe it or not.
More romantic than necessary.
Come on, man, it's the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly
It's been a while since we sat and talked like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to spend with you.
But you should go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, for hours, I told the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, or contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
May God be with you.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have his number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has been sold now, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and photography.
Umm Abdulaziz says they are poor and...
This is what God has decided for them; we should not interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's wrong with you?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you with good.
Anytime, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a nearby villa so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough, men.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighbors before houses.
I want to take a picture with him.
So my colleagues will believe me.
I couldn't believe our house was right next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Talk to him so he believes.
What a life!
What we used to see on TV.
We wish to see him.
Our neighbor has changed, praise be to God, praise be to the Lord!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
Happy to help you, but guys, ease up on me a bit, I'm still not quite used to it.
I heard about him.
This is a great act of kindness from him. May God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
It has been confirmed that some staff will be relocated to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan.
She told you who's coming out?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard, I'm sure of it.
This is Abu Ali among them.
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who we'll be moving with.
I can't go, please, the smoke is too far away from me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, this is our job, boss.
The committee is still studying the subject.
But if they choose you.
Thank you for visiting me, welcome! Please sit down and have some coffee.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Well done, the furniture is old.
We are neighbours today.
We are like a family.
This is very kind of you, Abu Walid!
May God reward you with good, Abu Waleed.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I'm ready to take you around the market until you find the sweetest and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
I will never cry for you (proverb)
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to yell at her when she called me yesterday.
Not because of your tiredness.
No more.
I'll talk to you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing in comparison.
Don't worry, Mom.
Just wait a moment.
Just wait a moment.
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her for me.
I told you.
No, Mother, don't worry.
And you're asking me to propose to you.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you'd like to have dinner, there are many great restaurants nearby.
The driver is taking her to university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
So, which car is this?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people, who love charity.
By God, you're right, father!
Even our relatives won't do that for us.
Sure! Is my name included?
Sure?
Oh the troubles, why do problems chase us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, after hearing this news, what to do, I don't know.
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What happened, Abu Ali!
The committee met today.
And the list of names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, ah! Oh, Mother Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he said there's no way.
Famous actor
Consider your name was never on the list.
Thank you, much appreciated, Abu Salem.
If you don't mind.
I want to take a picture with you so I can show it to my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Sure, God bless you.
Exalted is Allah, may He be pleased with you, Exalted.
Sure, I'm happy to help.
You and those you love
Let me know a day or two in advance.
Oh Mother, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
What's wrong with you this time? Have you gone crazy?
She said, "I have no objection."
Let your mother come.
Go to them.
But, oh! My son
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
It has to be trendy.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You put me in a difficult position.
Why are you taking out all these jewels? I've never seen you do that before.
It's me.
Mother of Ali
Mother Ali is serving her son.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and well-off.
Inshallah (surprise)
Lucky she is.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and more *blue*.
Inshallah, I hear.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You must be prepared as well.
They're asking you to meet her father.
I'm sure I won't go in this outfit.
When I enter with my new clothes
Oh mother, take care of her belongings.
It is kind of Um Walid to give you her things, so use them carefully.
OK
So we should be like them.
Why, didn't his mother go to arrange his marriage?
This is for women.
I have to go and meet the guys.
As you can see, God bless you.
Only the vest is left, please.
Kind people, they helped me.
They were helpful, but the Pashmina shawl is what remained.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
All the people stand with you.
So, Rashid, should I unpack it in front of you, or hold on to it?
No, look, first.
You need to secure this with buttons.
Takes my breath away
The dress is loose, but...
God bless you.
The left hand should be inside.
Relax the right hand, like this.
Hold the bisht from underneath.
Wow, wow
How wonderful!
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Ah! Sorry, yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, right, seconds?
Put your left hand, like this, left, like this.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's wrong with her?
Do you know what she was telling me this morning?
She told me: "Because you're my friend and I don't want us to be apart."
I will ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask his sister and not to embarrass her or himself.
I've been hearing a lot from you lately. A few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad wanted me for her uncle, and today you want me for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
While I just sit and watch
Do they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Okay, later.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
My son Waleed refuses.
Actors are more sincere than you, two-face!
But you,
You behave your whole life.
This doesn't reflect on you.
To serve people
He lied to the people.
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while appearing on television.
Me neither!
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
To play
To get married
What's the scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He is wearing his headscarf to the side of his face.
It doesn't turn right or left, as if it's dead.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with the boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
May God help him, man!
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the shape of the city center.
No, no, no, no, you can't sit like that, it's not a nice view.
You look better awake, when you're standing, stand, stand, stand.
Please, Khamis!
So, are you going to the city center?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
I'm satisfied with that!
Oh my God! Thursday
Run it, and if the host is female.
I change the channel because I'm afraid it's going to get me into trouble.
I swear to God I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
Talk to her.
I hung up the phone in my face, take it, take it.
I hung up the phone, now I'll get sick.
This time you're saying I made you talk to her because there was a woman with us.
Now you can throw me out of the house.
Get lost!
You're not the first one to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, ah! Brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
He entrusted it to me.
She said: Don't shoot.
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong with you.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem in particular is one of the best men in our town.
He wants you to let him go.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, am I stupid to divorce him, this is unbelievable.
Thursday, I officially went crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
"May God guide you."
Poor thing, it breaks the heart.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to? May God guide you.
No, nothing, nothing at all.
Give it to me, I'll give it to him.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting with the women's delegation
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm talking to you with full awareness.
Oh! Brother!
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we delete your name?
The only one who can remove your name is the Honorable Minister.
This is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safe and sound, safe, and indeed, he was safe.
If you're talking to Salem
Should I speak or not?
That lie won't fly.
Don't lie, Khamas.
You're not telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
What a miserable life.
God bless you, give Salem my regards.
Please believe me.
Will you call him?
This is not your business.
Mind your own business, or you'll find something unpleasant.
They complain about you.
Hello?! Hey, you!
How do you tolerate living with a woman who has a sharp tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan went to invite Thursday.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start.
God willing, he will find it.
His heart sank when he saw the women.
I searched the whole ministry and you were hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh Thursday! How do you know your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
Oh my God, do you want her to suspect me? Don't you understand?
If I answer her call, how will I go home?
Will your wife call at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which will be implemented by your company for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Guys, why is the table shaking?
No, it's been a while, not the table, I'm the one sitting.
Can you return your call?
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted because he was scared to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that his wife said not to come home unless you change your job and don't work with ladies.
This is the reason that prompted him to send a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What's his wife's story?
This is madness.
I ask him, "Who are you talking to?"
I told you he's crazy.
Get ready! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you did what you wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your kids?
She wants official proof.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, that's what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
Until you see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And if God wills you to agree, if you agree, I will go home tonight, God willing.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
A different office and job from the one he used to work in.
Where is this department, please?
Yes, please, this is the minister's permit.
Nothing, nothing, that's it, on your right.
Yes, may God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdul Qadir, God willing, it's a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a transfer?
The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can execute another decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh brother, reconcile with your colleagues.
And address them by male names so that your wife won't know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee, he is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office sent us someone to work with us.
Grandpa!
It looks funny, the poor guy, a man working among five women, it looks funny.
They say his wife is extremely jealous of other women around him.
Blind envy
Poor him, he's in need.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife spoke, so we agreed and remained silent.
Ah, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
See if it fits you.
My son called, said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Keep going straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With the fifth ***
These are six employees.
And this is here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of other women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
May God guide you, Sultan.
But we want to know how far we've come.
Uncle, Falcon, and I were at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and ready to go out.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
A scorpion's sting causes severe pain.
This is important for rain, see see.
Look, uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
So the meeting is postponed until tomorrow.
Inshallah, it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must execute.
They need to realize you're an important supervisor.
I have a lot of responsibilities and commitments.
They consider women as servants.
I haven't seen people hate women as much as they do.
At what age do they believe they are living?
They asked me not to go to work today, and instead go to the kitchen to make tea.
Where are the restrooms?
And the second one fled a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their mistreatment.
I understand them.
May God be with you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Uncle, they mean this.
In fact, the villa complex is nothing without the park.
Okay, now, the park...
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My beloved Fatima, I must go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And play it at school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
You know if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You are to blame for this.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? I haven't seen you in a long time.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married or not yet?
Oh, God guide you.
Who would agree to marry a woman who can't read and has no education?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's my mother, he's a man.
And Ali Thursday is the son of Scorpions.
The scorpion's sting is painful.
And he must marry someone from the same social class.
A scorpion like him.
Good health to you.
What should I do, Aisha!
Ever since the minister traveled, all the papers are referred to me.
And tell Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet with him the day after tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
I'm free now to talk to you, Aisha!
Yes, Mary.
Okay, I'm coming, okay, I'm coming now.
What should I say, O Aisha!
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
It's okay, honey. Ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
Didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about her?
They went to her, they beat her.
Would they know if I told them it's a football?
They beat you a long time ago.
Oh, the shame, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The Big Scorpion
This is small.
Oh, come on, Uncle, I didn't hit her, it was Sultan who hit her.
Did you hear this?
I chose economics and politics.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's your turn.
You had your chance.
Do not be greedy.
Okay, scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the Scholarship Department.
And cross out architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Saqr.
They have no objection to Manira getting married.
What else do you want?
Yes, our Thursday deserves all the best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to be with the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Frankly speaking with you,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's correct.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I'm surprised.
The payment for their car loan comes out of my salary.
And I provide for the house.
She wants to take me with her.
Aren't we getting married this week?
What are you saying?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
Okay, let's go.
This is a flaw.
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh, my son! I've told you many times.
Why don't you go?
I'll go tomorrow.
It doesn't matter, as long as he's a scorpion's son.
Appearance is what matters.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
And go to the kitchen.
And put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
Inshallah, Valencia won't win against us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and hardworking.
What's your opinion on this?
What do you want to do?
We have to go.
Please proceed to your offices.
Thank you, may God prolong your life.
Long life
They serve coffee there.
Her happiness
May God grant her a long life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Colonel.
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go pour Captain Emad some coffee.
And also
We're playing in China after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
Going to the official engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister!
Say hello to %pw.
Yes, Madam
Pour it out and make a new one.
Actors pretending
You know, after Mashael called me a few minutes ago.
What should I tell her?
This is unfortunate, the role of Nov does not suit Mashael.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And it's clear that Mashael is in her twenties.
Okay, why don't you take Mary's role?
Suits her better.
Nouf is thirty.
We need to get rid of the critical person on the committee.
He's a problem. I'm sure he won't let things go smoothly.
It's detailed.
He talks about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him for that committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hamad might influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company is registered under the name of Mara Hamad, may God bless you.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, guys, everything is fine, come on in.
I spoke to them and they agreed to everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
It is produced by the Modern Touch Arts Institute.
It's a cute, unusual, and bold procedural series.
I agree with Hamed.
The storyline of the series is very nice.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And I didn't know she was his mother, it's exciting, and when the police came.
And her son comes from school.
Strike the box.
So he stepped on her, and she flew into his mother's net.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box extends into the mother's room.
Praise be to God, a local company produces this advanced level of output.
We need to encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and thoughts on the series, this is "blackmail of the conscience."
Extortion of human values
Disgusting surprises
Zero people per episode
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
What carries a moral message helps society to progress.
Tears fall, why do you love making viewers cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You've given us your opinion, Ali gave us his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
Clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you.
You organized it.
Some people understand because it's their specialty, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I don't agree with this series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said, "This is from Lady Samira."
I don't know what to do.
How true! O Nasser
This is the logo for the new series we'll be producing soon.
What makes the driver rape the girl?
For the blessings we received because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
"How are you?"
So present it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role covered their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
Sweet dream
I've played a similar role before, didn't you watch "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
They call it blackmail or something like that, I don't remember exactly.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why do all the names sound alike?
Last year's TV series were all about girls.
You notice that each group contains more than eight or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are very beloved.
Lucky you.
By God, Omar.
There, done, done.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Just eat and walk.
He said he wanted to see me about a very urgent and important matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And I told him, "You're going to bother him."
I told you he complained about the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and said they wanted to meet me.
I'm also afraid that the minister will believe him.
I'm going to meet the minister.
The man came to explain his point of view about the series.
This is all.
This is true, may you live long, God willing.
But first, sir, I would like to say that it is not acceptable to talk about a colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is...
He is jealous of everyone around him.
He only cares about material gain.
But this is his specialty.
But, good job, not every educated person can handle these arts.
Especially television productions.
Conscience blackmail, the series we're working on.
Mass production
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your specialty. You know more about this subject than I do.
I promise you an amazing series.
This will maintain our reputation.
Look at what journalist Abdul Hamid wrote. Listen, listen.
Similarly, one of the actors said:
That the series promotes unethical ideas.
This is limited to the decline of morals.
This, indeed, is bold and strong criticism.
They'll be in big trouble if journalist Abdelhamid continues writing about them.
And if the people I accuse know about it.
But they are smart, they know how to handle her.
These are elderly people.
We need to create our own website.
And add all our company's activities to it.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The series "Blackmail of Conscience," produced by Mercury Media, is considered one of the distinguished dramatic works that shed light on important social issues. The episodes address topics such as corruption, exploitation, and the internal conflicts faced by individuals in our societies. The series stands out for its strong acting and tight script, making it a work worth watching.
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries moral values and ideas.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
He is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept this?
The journalist Abdelhamid and those like him
Don't worry, Professor Hamed.
He asked what I thought of the series, and I told him it would be the best series in the Arab world.
Inshallah
I feel like our series is going to be a time bomb.
I don't know where he is.
One more person packs their bag and gets ready to leave.
A lackluster beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events didn't actually happen.
Love at first sight.
Your book is boring.
It's possible.
Your show is stupid, ridiculous.
What do you think?
This is a great tragedy.
Other bad series are no excuse.
This production can be understood at first sight.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, you need someone who focuses to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It's a pity it's over.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't that nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif with Ali yesterday.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is upset, that's a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be fired.
What a failed series, all the people who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him the series is a failure and there's no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser does.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Please Ali
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also insulted it.
Don't make me angry.
Sorry
That day I was on leave.
I will never let them write this.
But frankly, I haven't received any messages praising me.
Once again, great success.
Goodbye
My brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Blackmail is the best TV show.
May you live long, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they have another agreement with the viewers' page?
I almost had a heart attack.
He told me after a while.
Lucky you, the minister is satisfied.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch Conscienceless Extortion Part II
No, no, no, no, enough, brother!
The series, he said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Problems
Third and fourth after
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
And what can the magician do?
I wish you more success.
Please share your thoughts on this success.
I thank God for this success.
These are our haters and enemies of our success.
I find that strange.
This TV series wins awards, yet it's a failure.
But they are the experts.
They awarded her the prizes; they must see what we can't see.
Prepare the second part of the series.
May your life be long.
A real wizard.
You'll see, "blackmail of conscience" is coming.
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
This is the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and they become clean.
All the weak, absurd, and immoral series you watch.
They nominate him for Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it and give it awards, so that people consider it high-class.
Yes, that's right.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your safety.
It's true we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't let him fall.
"Or we will terminate the contract."
We already signed a contract yesterday.
With the British company.
Cup of coffee, please.
As you like it.
He did a great job.
He will be the first in the world to produce this product.
He is not just the best bread baker in the world.
I'm telling you.
How is the bread with (sosta)?
Open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
This, he made bread with zataar (thyme).
To put the cheese and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
So, what do you think? In fact, this is a bag of bread.
How can we remove this zipper?
So, one can say to his friend: "I ate two zippers."
Why weren't the pastries delivered to the Noor Mountains hospitals yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make it.
Once again, use the bakery.
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
So what's the problem if he takes a few employees from the company to be happy with them?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven starting players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
Team spokesperson
Why are you upset with him?
But the situation is acceptable at the moment. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and they are the twelfth player.
I'll let you enjoy their company.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
Your hearing
Didn't do anything
No, you're not upset with him just because he had some employees play football in front of him and have fun.
I said that some employees can't be replaced.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend them some.
Important bakers
Oh my son, why are you taking the important bakeries? That's not right.
Next time, notify me before you hire any employee.
No, no, let Hamda handle these paperwork things.
He is in the hospital.
Why, weren't you informed?
I finished my work, and as I was getting into my car
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find a goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
He told us to find a goalkeeper, and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear goalkeeper gear.
I've never touched a ball in my life, I've never played soccer.
That case
This is stupid.
And we'll get you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
Let me explain.
Oh boy, you want me to disband the team, right?
By God, you are right.
Alright, Father, please, I beg you.
I can't split up the team, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations to the winners.
Congratulations, President Nasser, on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win?
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked very hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as we promised.
It seems your father is happy.
I'm afraid he's just putting on an act of kindness and politeness.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, we'd like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a huge success
God bless you, no, no, no.
No photo without a flash, wait, wait, stabilize it.
No, no
He is wearing the bisht.
Your interest, enthusiasm, and creative insights have played a significant role in this success, indeed.
And the coach's plan
But, they played with a 5-5-3-2 formation in the final.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet the Packers didn't get confused and did a great job.
And the coach's plan
"As one of the first players on the International Bakers' Team, what advice would you give to the players?"
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
"Are they asking, 'Is Hamad Sultan with them?'"
Welcome them to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz!
This is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still small.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
"You se
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
Football introduced me to him, I reminded him of it.
I said to him: "O Abu Abdulaziz!"
You've never been interested in soccer your whole life.
What's your involvement in the matter?
The ball was always close to me, but there was a gap of fifty cents between us.
Has Abu Nasser arrived yet?
No, he hasn't appeared yet today.
There is a seminar on football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he must be present.
You'll see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wants to turn into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspired the bakery team with his great ideas.
What's the news about the International Bakery Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
This is a small amount, but a million dollars for all these efforts.
No, man, be generous.
It's not my fault, brother Shahin.
My mistake.
What's my fault?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices in US dollars are very high.
That means if a player costs two thousand.
For the Gulf, it costs three or four million dollars.
What I understand, explain it to me.
Receive fax here
And read it to me when you have it.
My father bought four new players for the team, changing the lineup with a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily defeat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it's written as eight hundred thousand.
Yes, that's right, God bless you, but it was a Turkish club that set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Alright, can we inspect the goods?
Here
Calf's leg
Zaina, it's manageable.
No, no, no, I don't guarantee you.
He is fat, God willing, thank God he is fat.
This is slim, suitable for the middle.
The connecting muscle
This is the most important muscle; it's of no use to a player without it.
Thank you.
Let your driver take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did I say! Automatic.
How did it happen?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, may God exalt you, are young players.
Ah, we'll get them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the wild.
Come on, take it. Do you have a place for it, or should I take it in my pickup truck?
When he saw their pressure on us
The offending player was asked to play.
"Kakakano makalali dinde, la" translates to "It's not a small thing, indeed." in English.
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I don't like the way he runs the game.
This should be on the way to the north.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's going on? Why are you shouting?
Your stupid son
I'm not convinced that the coach is an expert in football.
Listen to her, she speaks like Mitsu.
He knows that the attacking player Selolo Tekawawa is a good midfielder, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one is going to give you a headache.
Just stay away.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team should consider changing the plan.
Since the players are not playing in their positions.
The player Tekulamaka Kllallato is out of position, he should be moved to his usual spot.
Ask the coach to change ...
To expel Hopway Malalo
Present, present, present
No, no, no, no, what's happening at the stadium?
This is what should have happened.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these matters until the game is over.
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This coach is stubborn.
Tell him, Uncle Abu Nasser doesn't want you as a coach for their team anymore.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you're staying as a reserve player, do anything I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Ya Rashid, enough!
What's wrong? You scared me, tell me what's wrong?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
Divorced! How?
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You weren't married for even a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without a reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mom, I don't know. Suddenly, he came and told me to go to my parents' house.
I asked him why. He told me: "You're divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's going on?
They were married for only a month. What do people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I just know he's divorced you now.
Sit down. I'll be with you in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to this team and respects it.
She insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me your mother insulted Barcelona, and I said to him, "Divorce her, and I'll marry you to another woman."
To tell him that your daughter got divorced because she disrespected Barcelona FC.
Just for that reason, you divorced her, Grandpa?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
The wife questions her husband's loyalty.
How true what I hear!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time, she started mocking Messi.
Problems arise between couples, and we have to deal with them.
One in a thousand girls.
The girls really want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere, this is my son and I know him well.
I told you, it's none of your business.
I'll be upset with you.
Don't tire yourself, my son, and don't think about her.
Instead of being one in a thousand.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words
This Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Okay, my love.
What's in it!
Her name is Mona.
She was married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she left her husband, you won't be able to stop laughing.
To get you to engage with him, we need your attention.
What's his interest with this person, he divorced his wife because of a football team.
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Oh, Mom, don't get me involved in this. I don't want to get mixed up with those people.
That is, you are hearing the nonsense of barbers.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her piece and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming her way.
I told her, "My daughter, don't stop your luck!"
If it was just her money, I wouldn't care, God knows.
But she will stop her luck and ours with her.
This building
He won't say no to me.
God protect us from the evil of this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Do not listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of opportunity that has opened for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You must be joking. Can you believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all this nonsense and don't go crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And maybe she is the reason or there is something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Burjain slip through your fingers.
What is this, O Father of Two Towers?
But when they get closer, they discover they are towers.
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Borjayn.
Hello Alpha, God bless you.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Ah, thank you. God bless you.
"May God grant you a long life (proverb), they took the money, you signed and they spent it."
Your happiness was absent-minded and you seemed very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, divorced.
He was married and divorced as well.
Ah, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, my brother, be firm with him.
Oh my God! This is a difficult generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter.
Oh my daughter, don't forget your chicken, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you on the plane.
When you arrive in London
Oh, my son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mother.
Okay, fine.
So you can come with us and drive too.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's the story?
I did the right thing by ignoring her.
She is nothing.
During the honeymoon period, you're supposed to be taken care of in every way.
Is it logical that she is sitting while you are pouring the water!
The glass is next to you, why don't you pick it up and drink?
Well said, Zine.
You should have told her that since the day I was born, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's in it?
You look very sad.
And who is this with her?
Her name is Mashael.
Poor thing, she got divorced on her honeymoon.
Would you believe me if I told you her story?
God bless you, auntie, thank you.
Your aunt requested, and also your aunts.
Yeah, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Hello, Mom.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
By God, they don't understand anything.
Okay, where's Manira?
She's in her room talking to that fool.
She's saying now that she's been trying to call him for two days, but his phone is switched off.
I just found it.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired and wants to rest.
Oh, mother, every day I tell her to peel the apple, but she doesn't do it. Every day she upsets me.
And you know I don't like the apple with its skin.
She peels the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And another one when necessary.
Come on, my dear!
Come on, my dear!
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still sad!
Call him three times and say, "You are divorced."
Be quiet, may God give you health.
I don't know who saw me at the disco in Spain and told her.
He has nothing to say.
Right, he has nothing to say.
You're going to dance twice or three times.
And whoever marries my daughter will die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to vent my anger on this scoundrel.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are a toy for you and your son.
They have no families and mothers who feel the bitter taste in their throats.
Who are you making fun of?
And divorce them where you please.
"What helped you drink water, curse Barcelona, divorce her and forget her."
Who went to a nightclub?
Without shame and embarrassment
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Sit still and don't move.
You have a bit of humanity.
This was my father's king.
Who sells such land?
Abu Sakr took it from my parents by force.
Why does he sell it?
God guide you, if Abu Saqr wants something, who can say no to him?
Just leave it to God, men.
Come, come.
Come on, come on.
What's the status of your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to run your project, you need to start paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
What does he eat? Is there anyone in this world who doesn't eat?
This is not a problem, brother. We'll make him eat and be full, and we'll fill his stomach. The problem is how we reach him.
You should know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I meet him in Umrah and greet him more than once.
What you need to know is that as long as you're paying for it and getting your work done, the important thing is to know the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came right away.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Oh man, anyone!
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's so nice to stay at this farm during the night time.
Yes, Sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car dealership behind the mall.
He wants to meet you, Sir.
Get the license.
Like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, just say OK.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
Praise be to God, my business is doing well.
So you met him and talked to him easily.
Don't be stupid.
Yeah, it's okay, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances served me.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a gift for you.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, take me to him.
Yes, it happened.
She has just been discharged from the hospital.
Tonsillectomy
And he will certainly hold a feast.
You deserve the safety of your son, Your Excellency.
We hope he recovers, we hope he recovers, God willing, he will not see any harm, God willing.
We met at the flower shop.
I think so.
Man! We're starting to forget and get old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the next room and has already left.
So I thought I should visit you.
And congratulate you on Shahin's health.
Listen, my lord judge, you should not leave without having dinner with us.
I'm not in the mood for it.
Just say yes first.
Because our dear son Shahin has left the hospital,
In my Corniche Tower.
Just say yes.
Oh, my son! Don't be stubborn.
Oh Mother, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a business without capital these days?
At the car and bulldozer agency, he said just let him gesture.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Whatever God's will, your all-father loves you, just point him.
Oh businessman! These people are borrowing from banks to establish a company or a business.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is also something new.
This is Saqr, the apple of my eye. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
I only took their agency yesterday.
"You se
He told me after all the traders love me, "God creates everyone like you."
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
I really like it.
I don't know who its owner is.
A thousand congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Sakr, a thousand congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it that easily?
You, now you can say no.
What's the matter?
What should I say?
Be his partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
Who knows his father!
I said I was Qasem Abbas's friend. He asked me, "Do you have experience in trade?"
I said I have a bakery, praise be to God, I can live off it.
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice it.
No, oh! Brother, the name is not nice.
So let me suggest a fitting name for Iranian bread.
Understood, big bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, too, and the mercy and blessings of God, Your Honor.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
Your Honor, she had her car sent for repairs and came to take mine because she works as an advertising agent at a marketing company and cannot do anything without a car.
You might still need your car.
No, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, every person should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent, Dr. Sami!
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
What he studied was neither business nor economics.
He has never read a book in his life, not even a newspaper. I've never seen him hold any paper in his hands.
You all know who Falcon is today.
I didn't want him to enter this business and %pw, but...
His uncle Abu Nasser is here in front of you, still alive.
Whoever likes it.
But some people are born for trade and naturally love it.
You're right, Doctor!
God willing, Shahin, you will be like your brother.
God willing, our Lord is Generous.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one can be like you, Doctor. (A popular saying)
Frankly.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily develop such a great sense of economics?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count them among them.
You know, Abu Saqr?
Saquar chose the market for horsemanship.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Eagle, wants to take over the car dealership from my father?
The agency no longer owns it.
By God, people are never satisfied.
His father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to trade.
Frankly, the doctor said he's in critical condition.
This isn't going to work.
Nothing works.
Shocked or hit, not my problem, I'm telling you, you're going to divorce her, divorce her and you will divorce her.
In the 21st century, there are such people.
We meet, dear viewers, with one of the good and giving men in this country.
A man knows the way to the beggar and the deprived.
I mean, we have a founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Society.
Of course, if we're talking about this organization, Your Excellency.
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world and, of course, to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, we were recently able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
Praise be to God, now we are ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
Whatever God wills, sir, may God make many people like you.
My wife and I had just left the house.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to inaugurate her new project.
And I'll wait for her.
Normal.
I really enjoy their company and love spending time with them. I have so much fun.
And also a source of income for my children.
This is all my life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Hot bread, hot bread.
Come on, people!
In the 21st century, there are such people.
In the 21st century, there are such people.
If anyone wants to dive, diving takes effort.
He needs brave men.
Long live Souq Waqif.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you all.
Praise be to God, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is good.
I wanted to say something, but it's too late now.
On the occasion of getting his license, my son Shahin must go to the showroom and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
A breeze blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breeze, for love, take me home.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anaud?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days! How ignorant.
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes more time.
And if God wills, will you talk to Alanoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, Anaad won't be.
What's next, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't let me miss out on this.
Is my dress ready?
This is for you, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I'll come by next week to pick up the dress, God willing, stay safe.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
Whatever God's will, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing something amazing and girls are coming and going.
Alhamdulillah, we were very successful in this project.
What's wrong with you?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong?
Look at the jealousy!
And I haven't heard that he started a business. Where does this bankrupt get the money from?
Open their mouths, plunder!
And when he begins his work,
Sure?
I heard some gossip.
And if God wills, what will you do?
It's seven in the morning.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
But, Dad, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you... (I heard you...)
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these things, may God guide you, cousin.
Design, women's fashion design, and the like?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need advice, you need %pw. I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Thank you, cousin.
This is a sorry, I have to go.
Go ahead, son.
The first time you tell me if you need a raise.
Hey, Fadi! Clean the shop, I see you're busy?
The shop is no longer enough.
I told you that you should rent the shop next to ours, trust in God and take it.
God willing.
Did they rent the shop next to them?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a document at my friend's place. His name is Essam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Sure?
I saw the ring and his name was written on it.
What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? What's wrong? It has a flaw.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw my project succeed,
You told me I had to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What does he mean?
And I was testing you, I told you, "Do you intend to open a business?"
By God, I did not lie to you, men.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about your accent or your demands.
But this is what gets you there.
Man, it's destiny and people get what's destined for them.
You beat me.
Come on, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh has crossed the line.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer bag.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Madam! This looks wonderful on you, no, no, this one, it's unparalleled in all of Doha.
Either this or nothing, madam. And with such sweet talk and a piece worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty and forty thousand.
Yeah, just do the same.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
My lady! I will design for you a wardrobe unparalleled in all of Doha.
Look, if you want to succeed
What's wrong exactly?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the customers.
What do you think about moving to another place, boy?
Do not remember, do not remember ah! Fadi.
And by this time, they'll be playing by themselves.
It means we lost, no!
We have to confront them!
We return our customers, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
That dress you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the tie in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
We placed a crystal on it for you. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the entire world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are globally renowned.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's wrong? What happened?
Strike us, O Sa'd, strike us.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we have no more customers.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We're just watching!
We need to fight them the way they fight us and respond to them as well.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
And I will initiate the war against them and see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop him.
Check the ad!
Make sure of the advertisement he puts up!
We offer a free evening dress with every wedding dress.
With every wedding dress, four evening dresses are sewn.
We publish a quarter-page ad.
See, he's running a half-page ad.
I don't know what he intended to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer has entered their store.
No, they didn't even open until this afternoon, they closed.
And you will hear that he put his store up for sale.
Throw it, throw it.
Even they can't sit there, so he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
Oh God, guide you, I can't drink it, this is a problem.
Does anyone hate you?
In one, God bless you, spray the place with this smell intentionally.
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are cousins, you are adults and not young children to fight like kids.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything. This is your perfume.
Do not cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I've devised a hellish plan for him.
Without getting caught red-handed.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear to God, I don't know what's going on. Today is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our shops.
Oh my God, this isn't the store, we have to go to the other store, I've exposed my face, may God help you.
And what did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and there are no customers coming in.
I don't know, it's like they put a spell on him.
Women and girls do not approach the shop.
As if a spell had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
He is charming and evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go see him, brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will collapse.
It's lost, Sultan, it's lost.
I don't know, it's a dog!
Leave him alone!
Calm down, brother. Don't be angry.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? His friends say they are collecting money to pay off his debts.
Its designer
What is Lebanese?
I told him, didn't I?
Do you know where he is?
The stars are the same, and we desperately search for those extra roles.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong, what's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed?
What's wrong with you, Ahmed! You're just sitting here while the director is shouting at me! What am I supposed to do? Where are those extras you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone. I've been calling him and got a headache until I asked Professor Abdullah.
First of all, don't scream. We're actors and we want to be comfortable. We need to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man called more than once in front of me, but calm down a bit.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh my God! Professor Abdullah, what should I do now? The director is continuing the scene and yelling at me.
Okay, guys. Okay, guys.
We want to finish, but those extra actors who are supposed to be in the scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want anyone to shout at you, right?
Work quietly and without shouting.
This is our situation, always screaming, since morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing with a scene until I can, God willing, find an actor who can do the role well?
It's true he'll only appear in one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if I'm not ready today, I'll go resign.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
Are you saying something in Filipino, is it okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he resigns right away. He needs someone who looks like an elite, has to be elite and Qatari.
Oh man! If this guy wears a gutra and igal, no one will notice.
Grandfather, O Ala? You just want the easy way, this is a production that respects people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be comfortable.
Be quiet so we can think. Reread with me, maybe you'll remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmedi, do you remember someone in the Authority neighborhood named Saud Alsadr?
The same thing, Saud Al-Olaig.
Saud is puffing!
The manager said he wants a rich man with a good reputation, and you're talking about cans.
Dear, at the end of the day, he is an extra actor, you will bring a rich and distinguished man for an extra role.
But with light makeup, Reem, wearing a bisht and a clean thobe, and a luxurious car.
Insha'Allah, it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy boxes?
Who does he mean?
Ah, ah, ah, that's it, that's it.
Yes, that's it, thank you very much.
And now, mother, what will he do? There isn't a single drop other than this medicine that my uncle brought from abroad.
My son, you only have what you're wearing.
My son, it's inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are waiting outside. What should I iron for you?
May God help you, my son!
This means that I will be watching you today and you will be on television.
Yes, by God, Mother, and they said they would put me on TV as part of the elite.
Sit down, dog!
Come on, men. What's this? A spit on you.
Spray, spray.
Here it is, Mother.
Quickly, Mother, are you feeling better?
God willing, my son.
God forbid, hopefully they just give you money.
Good health to you.
Pray for me.
I'll get you boxes, Saud's laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
This is Abboud, Fatima's son, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will it make the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, he'll do a good job. Calm down and be quiet, so they give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She's not the same person who used to gather thorns like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, I'll regret nominating you.
The men who brought him played the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
He's here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Qafil Fadil.
The important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Oh brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager says.
Oh brother! Oh brother! Please, you're going to play the role of one of the elite, one of the wealthy, right?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is too careless, the role needs a serious person.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
Come on, brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen to me, you're going to the makeup room now, and I'll coach you on the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Hey, boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saud, he'll clean everything, he'll fix it.
Let's run it again, and the assistant director is there to watch you and assure the director.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You say this?
Ah, ah, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush. I didn't expect that from you! Oh Abu Abdulaziz, say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Sweet, and you need to know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother!
Please complete the full name: Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzook, Latif.
Sweet, trust in God, think and then trust.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't bother asking why I divorced her.
Your daughter is divorced. Is she pretty? Pretty?
She is very beautiful. Trust in God and believe in yourself. We are not getting married.
Why don't I spit on him?
Strange, you are strange and he memorized everything, strange.
Let him clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Dude! The house owner surprised us, and they need the hall. The director decided to shoot the indoor scenes in the hall and then film the outdoor scenes later.
How are you? They don't want %PW!
Yeah, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed until another time. They'll film another scene, and we'll be behind them, God willing.
Should I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
"Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon him."
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe are you from, boy?
My name, sir, is Salem Abu Shuwei al-Shuwei.
Barbecue is popular.
You deserve it.
Tickled, my nose is big and lips can be placed here too.
Tell me, my brother! People with a narrow nose these days,
I'm holding myself.
If it was someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mom.
My mother is very sick, I must go quickly, oh my God! Brother!
You're going with those clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very sick and he says!
Listen, you can go like this, but when I call you, you must come right away.
He and I, we can't leave the site.
Alright, alright, I'll try to find a taxi. Brother!
Taxi what? If you try to look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
We rented the car for the scene.
Since it's available, take it.
Oh! Brother, please give me the key. My mother is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
He's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Hold on, hold on, I'll get a wheelchair now, right now, old man!
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh my God! My son, what happened?
Be quiet and don't speak, just watch and keep silent.
Peace be upon you.
Nothing, just my mom, the lady, she's having a crisis, quickly.
I'm telling them to make the bed.
Okay, okay.
And don't bother.
God protect you, what have you done?
Zayn oh! Rashid.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you like, come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashood.
I'll take Professor Rashid and do what he wants.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what you'd like to drink, sir.
Come with me, Mr. Rashood.
Sorry.
What should I do with so many people, just wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first; Nasser, the hospital security guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I refused?
Not even one person gives me attention.
They theorize and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, and I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Oh brother! There's a girl in the hospital, I love her.
If she ignores you, find someone else.
I can't, oh my brother, my heart is hanging.
Your brother is in love, believe it, the day I saw her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God curse you.
Your Honor, our aunt is now in good health.
Oh Saud, man, you're a professional actor!
Wonder how they clapped for you and how they praise you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh man! Forget about it, come and sigh for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget this and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, dear.
Buffet one!
I made two.
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say: "Wow, they are so classy. I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mom.
I must bring them something on the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's wrong, mother?
Look at your brother who's embarrassing us!
Oh, this is embarrassing, by the way, it's cheap.
But this depends on our budget; it works.
Leave this for the maids to eat.
He wants to joke with us.
I saw her.
This type is the free category, it's for the sophisticated community.
Almost above average.
No, we want something unusual, something no one can afford.
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities (like me).
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What is this luxury? It's very advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I'm at your service, I'm at your service.
I'm coming for you.
They reserved the small dance hall and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What did she say about Saad's wedding?
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
My dear sister,
He only cares about money.
He doesn't care about what people say.
He wants to joke with us.
But we should get something within our budget and circumstances.
You know some people take loans, sell their houses and cars just to have a lavish wedding to silence people from talking about them.
Leave it to us, and the cheap chocolate is enough to keep us stocked.
I said the manager liked the Chinese food and took it home.
Okay, if the bride's family says that we choose the hall, the theater, and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, nothing, but the shop we used to go to has a very good price.
By the way, this store designed Abu Dhahb's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of Mr. Mubarak's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't want anything used.
I need a stage where we are the first people in the world to use it.
This means you want to stand out.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is being used in Qatar for the first time.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and advanced.
How much does this stage cost with other arrangements?
Leave now, but not for less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, at this rate our money won't be enough, everything is luxurious, better, and best, all of this costs money.
Everyone does that.
Come on, be quiet.
What is the decision?
I mean, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, I don't need Noah's Ark.
These are weddings and their costs. By the way, we consider ourselves middle-class.
Do I have to pay 150,000 for the stage and 150,000 for the dance hall, the one you reserved, what you call the royal hall?
I didn't say box, but why is it a competition and everyone is trying to outdo each other and one-up the other person?
This is a battle of bragging rights, and only wedding hall owners benefit.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, exploiting us and lying to us.
By God, I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding hall.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father says "Ah."
Okay, do something.
Like the rest of the men who get married and take care of themselves.
Hello Sheikh, Your Highness.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I'm calling you.
First time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With the Noah's Ark stage, it will look amazing.
There is no such harmony; you will be the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay then,
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay then,
May God give you patience.
As you like it (proverb).
Expenses are high, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I've gathered is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother, Fahd.
How can I fix things, Fahd! As long as we boast at weddings, we'll be in trouble.
Without any boasting.
Of course, you'll receive the invitations you want.
Okay, this week, God willing, we'll start with the invitations.
Our wedding will be better than theirs.
Oh, mother, look at the invitations that your son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
Now people travel to countries just to design their invitation cards.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation card, printed it, and then returned. Same for Manira's family.
They went to France; even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their visas.
The system in the country works like this, do you want us to be different?
Fleesh, where do you want to travel?
We received many nice invitations.
Indeed, it's expensive, but...
But it's private, and no one has done it before.
Shiny, I love it.
Gold is much better, it shines.
Oh brother! If he can't afford the expenses of marriage,
Then why did he insert himself.
And leave off all this boasting and showing off at weddings and all these unnecessary expenses.
While the only beneficiaries of our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he leaves, poor thing.
Let me take him, he might not find anyone to take him.
Come, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you very much, Abu Nasser.
Brother, the bride's family should stand with you.
I tried once, just once.
I told them there was no need for a ballroom in a very well-known hotel.
Why, I found our daughter on the street, and the others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's just a simple party and some small expenses.
Oh man! These days, people get married on Facebook.
Cheaper and less costly.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget it, do you want to go crazy?
You see.
I won't invite Abdullah Roaished or Nawal to my son's wedding.
God damn her, she'll never be better than me.
I want to ask you a question, dear.
If your son has Rawaished's number, give it to us so we can call him.
Okay, my love. Thank you very much, goodbye.
Oh mum, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
Will Um Nassoor become better than me?
Forgot who she is and who we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not how it is, Mom. Look at my brother Saleh, he breaks my heart, and we don't pressure him much.
He really broke my heart.
Oh, wow!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, she just suddenly fell.
I heard that and just fell apart.
He's all talk and no action, and it's no wonder. After I had prepared everything and people found out, he said he didn't want to get married.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's embarrassing us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
Oh, my son! You are a man and you are the provider.
Go, go with her good grace.
I swear to God, if you say these words to Abu Yusuf, his heart will stop.
Do you know why the minister is still keeping Abu Youssef?
By the way, he should have retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong, he's helping me.
By God, you're crazy.
I understand, what do I need it for now.
And make him hide the papers and statements until the money is returned.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're terrified.
There's nothing to worry about, and at the end I'll return the amount to you.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The disciplined, the disciplinarians.
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there's no other way but this.
If I give to you and give to people later,
They are strict in their scrutiny, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, you ate the pill.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will be in the hall to receive guests.
No, we'll definitely be there.
Throwing a wedding for my son will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Okay, dear Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm afraid they'll envy you, my son! If you enter them tomorrow like this in the bisht.
"Mother, is it good if the coat is long?"
The police are here!
Inshallah, there's nothing wrong.
Police, just stay here and I'll be right back.
May God protect you from your evil, Saloh.
Forget your wedding.
Marriage cage, now he will enter the prison cage.
They discovered the document I was hiding about your loan, and now they've discovered me.
Why are you upset!
You hear worse things than that.
What else do you say!
A respectful and honest employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, in his eagerness to do his work, went and inquired about the materials.
He found out it costs four hundred thousand.
He will leave the ministry 1.6 million.
The minister punished him! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why don't you believe!
Here is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He fired him from his job.
What has happened to this world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him, "Let her work instead of Osman."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the company's director who presented the maintenance offer.
It was Uthman whom we discovered.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always amazed, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
That's how it is!
What are you saying!
I didn't mean my words, this poor employee Uthman, what's his fault!
His crime is that he is honest and trustworthy!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he just left.
What do you feel like in the world!
We started seeing strange people.
I'm with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do.
What is fair, Your Honor, he has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He earns a living from this job! What is he going to do now? Where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister.
She entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to get his belongings, but she stopped him and said, "Get out, and I'll send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have changed, Uthman!
This is the reward!
This is fate (proverb).
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
Oh Uthman, God is generous, He won't abandon you, goodbye.
What's wrong with you? You're not speaking properly!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Work and woe betide him! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity for me to visit my mother and get the things for you.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
The louder I shout at you, the more I ask of you.
How is this normal, by what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed. Where have you been living?
I don't know, mother!
You're crazy.
People are free, the world has become a small village, where are we living!
But what can we say!
Be modern, live this time, and don't be backward.
Get the stuff from the car quickly! Move, don't just stand there looking at me.
Something's wrong! Oh, Saleh, what's the matter?
No, you're not well today.
I shouted at the poor maid, she was blameless.
You know I didn't mean it that way.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
So that I may forget the disasters I have seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The manager is a bit angry.
Our pride and honor, my Lord.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Right, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
You are correct, Your Honor.
Tell me, what's the use of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
It's not possible.
This is the reason I want you all.
There is no place for honest people, nor for those with principled and relaxed values.
If you ever discover
He only blames himself.
Justice is a principle regardless of the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can match our sisters.
If Nora takes a bribe in the day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I want it to be like this, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to pick, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, O mother of Saud, enough, do not torment me any more.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient against Satan, who has tempted me and made lying seem appealing to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why did you bother with honesty and integrity?
You've always been a thief and comfortable.
Good for you that you became honest.
Let me talk to your father.
Never do it again.
One wants to be on the straight path, bribes, steals, and is hypocritical in order to live comfortably.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Okay, okay.
This is something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why isn't it uncovered?
You're shameless, you have no shame.
I'm shy, I wear my brother's clothes.
Are there shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Is there any respectable lady who wears such a thing?
And you walk in the street with nothing showing of your body?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to me.
I've never been late in supporting here.
I bought her some transparent clothes she doesn't need.
I warn you, if I ever see you in a place below the knee.
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
God willing, he will be a player and a villain.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm fine.
What a kind man. Frankly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
Only after we heard about it.
Alhamdulillah, her reputation is very bad.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what's up! Hello.
Come pick me up from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Alright dad, start your car, I'm waiting for you.
"I love you, Mary."
I still love you, I'm gone, gone, gone.
In brief, my father, the parent is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Dony, let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Majid.
No, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
Please, go ahead, it's a golden opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians didn't cut their nails.
As committed by the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinian fingers.
To see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should cut, tear, or draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
And the olives, man!
We press olives like this, like this we press olives.
We and our Arab brothers appeal to the international community.
To form inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
And what did you dream?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
O Rashid! You must have a strong character.
Hey bro, what's the number of the school you work at tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What's your personality, brother?
But the problem lies in his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
That's enough, brother.
That's why you see him calm.
Later, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we're not talking to you to make you angry,
We're telling you because this is your last chance.
And he told me, "Rashid accepted, even though he has a weak personality."
He is shy but very handsome.
Whatever the case, he is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
Mr. Rashid is new.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Okay, forget about her.
And from tomorrow,
Ah, this is good. What's next?
Here I tell you.
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Let's say a boy jumped up and told you the same thing the other boy said at your previous school, and the supervisor was present.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, the door breaks.
Okay, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I tell you.
I'm nervous.
It's up to me!
Just shut up!
He seems to have said, "Just shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him Professor Rashid expelled me.
It seems he said what concerns me, but we'll see, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Mr. Rashid is coming.
Did you see him?
The problem, doctor, is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting, during break time?
You can find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
At the end of the day, man is but human.
But you screamed at me!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
My father is out of the country, he'll be back next week, and when he returns, I'll tell him.
No, no, no, no, O Abdurrahman, may God preserve you.
We are friends. By the way, strawberry ice cream is really good, you might not have tried it. It has a bit of acidity, but the taste is amazing.
Alright, go get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is him telling his father.
I said his father is out.
Yeah, he's out, his dad doesn't come back? That means they took his dad's stuff and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
She carried his bags and brought them to him, gave him her phone number, and said, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Yes, but.
Ah, but what?
You're the ones who told me.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh Rashid!
Name, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't tire yourself, sleep.
Abu Nasser, Professor Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give it to me.
Walk, quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
That's why I gathered you, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can one guarantee a boy?
He's going to lead us into disaster, that is, he's calling now.
It's three o'clock.
I mean, hello. The line went dead, I swear he was joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the supervisor, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Hey! Teacher, come here, come here! Hey! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
How stupid! But I ask you, are you done?
Whether you finish or not, where is the teacher's authority? In this way, you are disrespecting yourself and the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Make room, make room, we have plenty of space. Come on, come on, come on.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do that and not do that.
God helps him.
I'm the boss here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
I was giving all the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who is the school principal?
You are the manager, may God bless you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair, brother!
What do you mean?
No need, to be honest, I really want to make things easier for you.
What do they call it?
What should we do with you now?
Improve your behavior for your own sake, and you will take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go, get out!
Okay, I'm leaving.
As you like it, we've told you so.
We must put him in his place.
Wait, people, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Salma.
Oh Abu Naif, you are the head of the neighborhood and it's your responsibility to stop him from crossing the line.
I'm not my father's son.
You'll see what I do to him.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Honor.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and blushed.
I didn't recognize him when he came, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he got a promotion last week?
Which means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Tell him to tell you what the secret is that he pulled out from under!
Here I'm telling you from day one,
When I am teaching, I don't want to hear any noise.
Not even a breath.
Act like a human being.
And you still reply to me, you still argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you are appointed as a minister, look for a good job along with it.
I mean, don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the other job, no, brother, don't give me options, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I really don't feel comfortable after the call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
"What will they say, mother? May God guide you."
This is very common. Every minister hires his friends automatically.
From this side, don't worry. It was a pleasure to meet you, %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
This, then, they are bribing me, this is flattery.
Wealth will come to us, a treasure, a treasure will be opened to us.
The big earth.
Come on, everyone go congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Minister.
With the blessings of my lord, a thousand congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Excellency, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency!
O brothers, the responsibility is great; may God help us bear it.
As they say, you are very qualified for this job.
You left, then Abu Saleh called.
It was far from him.
Forget him.
I'm surprised to see how she loves him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Good job, you did a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband died, she said she envied him.
God forbid, God forbid.
Ah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mama, let's go, I'm bored.
What do you mean, it's none of your business?
Just relax.
I cut them off because they made me nervous.
By God, they are right.
But I didn't want to say it in front of my mom, you know she'll tell everyone.
You blurt out everything you hear; they call it being a sieve. We don't want any scandals.
What does it mean to you if they assure you that if he falls, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What assures you that they are going to hit him?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Don't remind her, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You're going to do magic for him.
But the plan in my head is guaranteed and effective.
This is the "burn and purge" plan.
I'll make him attend every event in the village.
By that time, he will be burned out, and when he is burned out, he will resign. And when he resigns, he will be expelled.
I swear to God, brother, I don't know how or what to tell you!
Your visit is called, it is called participation that reflects the extent of your love for your country.
Do you think so?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, excuse me, sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Come, my lord, this is just a sheep, it's not worthy of your status. What do you think, my lord, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I'm sick, tired of the respect, tired of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are social, make a name for yourself!
God sends you this generous man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
Today I'm taking him to a poetry night and a wedding, and they've taken at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll tell you about something very nice to take to him.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Something like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I'm looking for that glitter.
Seller, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, picture of Your Highness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take a picture of me, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Excellency's greeting.
A picture, a picture as it is. You are fat, fat, my lord.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
This is a national contribution.
Say "Insha'Allah."
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurt me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
Children's swimming victory party.
Someone was telling his friend,
They thought I couldn't hear them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
Correct, correct,
I came to you as a light in the darkness, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
This means you won't go out and stroll with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to pick me up, I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't want anything from him, may God guide you.
Please, ladies, may God keep you, ask him. I'll call you later to confirm.
And you call yourself.
People give us discounts.
I told you.
This work is fantastic.
But let this brother come and get me!
The minister's happiness oppressed me, may God strike him down.
Hello, hello Your Excellency the Minister.
No, but I'm feeling a bit tired today and
Okay, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and go with you on a tour, and I hope he can find you a party or something like that.
Then, a party?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Okay, where can we find it?
Yes, indeed. Thank you, thank you.
Who should we ask?
Go, may God help you.
Sleep and rest.
Wait a moment, Saad.
Anything for a henna night?
This is good.
And there might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and look for a photographer to take his picture.
Okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, some reserve league match. Let him stay on the field by himself!
What is this! This minister is a disaster for us!
Sweet, that means he reached the top.
His end is very near when he becomes the talk of the town.
Your Honor, he has become much more popular than you.
Madam, if you go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh, Judge!
His star is shining bright.
We'll turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break you. I'm not going.
Brock breaks their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is Khalid, my brother.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see him!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this immortality?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, dear.
What's he doing? He's very attached to her.
There is no power or strength except from Allah; you return to the same issue.
Get up, get up and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and don't overdo it with the concern.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear to God, I'll tell my dad. Look at yourself, you look like a girl.
It means he was playing, playing.
Yeah, he was playing, I tell you, he was playing with the makeup set.
And this is Saud; I know how to deal with him.
Poor Khaled, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he creates about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we won't be going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Hi, Hamada!
Listen to my words.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
I'll let the dear Amal choose for herself.
But seriously, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
Even in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we will go directly from our house to the sea.
We and our children.
Please, you must decide on the wedding date.
Fine, just a year or so.
Your brother has recovered, he uses too much perfume.
Frankly, I noticed your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know there are unisex perfumes.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
I don't care.
How true, Khalid!
It's not the perfume that you use like women.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid!
By God, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Currently, perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very popular in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You need to see her, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid Muhammad's cousin.
Belongs to my cousin Khalid's daughter.
Alright, you'll see what I do to him.
I'm waiting for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him do it and you'll see. Come on, Saad! I'll send him a Bluetooth file so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you're defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting far away?
Is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Oh Saad! Are you crazy?
I'm traveling tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this town.
Where are you going by yourself?
What do people say?
They say their son left us and traveled, you don't want to cause us a scandal!
Oh, really?
And what your son Khalid did is honor and glory!
A man who turns himself into a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people when they say he's gay.
Tell him to go abroad for treatment, study, work, or even commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
I mean, where are we going?
What matters to me is where I go (proverb).
This is the end.
The second one, we don't know where he is, and this one here is packing his bags to travel.
Even we don't know where he's going.
What do you expect him to be?
What's wrong with you?! I came to cheer you up, and you send me hurtful words that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You didn't know anything about it and you were busy.
And your father is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What Khalid did humiliated us in front of people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you say something to him?
This is my father's biggest flaw.
We are in the case of the bad stranger, Khaled.
I didn't tell him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has come to this, Amoul!
Don't be surprised.
Khaled and his colleagues, what matters to them is the reputation of their families.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values have named them
And they go dancing and celebrating.
In the drain of evil.
By God, my son, I don't know!
Goodbye, father.
Take care of yourself, my son!
Oh father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid something might happen, come with me!
Okay, Mom.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
It might work.
Where is he going to take himself? There's not enough time to go anywhere.
Reply to me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Oh, dear!
Oh! Hope,
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your principles,
But forgive me.
May God help you.
I see you're heading to the roof!
Yes, indeed, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and nobody owes us anything.
If someone has a riyal, they can take a thousand oh! My dear.
Of course I can handle it. God bless America.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It is twelve hundred.
God help you, every time I talk to a driver, I ask him, "What's your salary?"
My salary is very low.
Whenever he sees me, he starts complaining. My salary is low and it's useless. We agreed with him that his salary would be seven hundred, and you increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, "When you complete a year of work, we'll increase your salary."
He seems greedy and we'll have tough times with him.
Shut up, shut up, just zip it, just be quiet, just be quiet, send it back and get rid of it.
This word is easy for you, easy.
You let him get on your nerves, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
I just told you the story, I'm the owner of the house. Be quiet now, stop, you be quiet too, I'll handle her.
People want you outside, go!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't enter your room, I said that, didn't I?
Oh, no, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He'll come for five minutes and then leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in mind!
Don't tell the madam I want a raise, I want a raise in my salary!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Oh boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
Drivers in Doha earn 1,100, 1,200.
And it could be one thousand and three hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll give you a hundred percent, but if you don't shut up, I won't.
What do you say I raised you an extra hundred, go get a job!
What did he say?
I'm telling you.
There's no use in water.
There's no use in complaining to the dead.
I'm afraid of Shashi.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you make more money.
I'm very scared.
See them, they're all drivers.
How much is the price?
Two thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will come and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and about to leave.
I was calling, but no one was answering.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I just say, God is enough for him.
Okay, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you have no liability.
We'll do everything we can.
And you too, take a look around the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yeah, he makes money, and when he's full, he turns himself in.
We accommodate them, spend on them, provide them with clothes, food, and driving training.
It's not his right.
The match is starting now, come in, entry is better.
By God, we were afraid.
These foxes, and foxes aren't easily caught.
You know if it's more than three, it means we didn't win, we need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear, this is clear sarcasm.
This is her level. If she can't score more than three, this isn't the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In us, in the players, and in the performance.
They don't have anything. They should thank God if they get less than three. They should thank God.
The target is anyone, these are the trainees. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, you're relieved and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals or should we stop here?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll feel dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox said, "My problem is big."
You can't catch up with him.
Yes, Sir!
Do you know or not?
He is a Foxes fan.
He sometimes appears on the "Refresh Yourself" show.
They win today, and you lose.
I swear to God I will defeat you. The Foxes never lose, they are always the winners.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, Foxes is the winner.
The birds came to take their livelihood and flew away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
I didn't see what Sharafah did on the field.
The audience couldn't stop laughing at him.
"It's clear in the stadium and thank you for listening."
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with the Qatari elite who go to malls and places like that.
He invited me for a cappuccino.
What a strange world, man!
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Let's recite the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Aren't you ashamed that my team beat yours 4-0?
Speak rudely, speak rudely about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was driven out
The reason behind that is a rule.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmak.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fan.
Excellent, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board members of the club will decide.
These aren't children, each of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. A fox.
Come, come see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One of them speaks well, and the other is mute.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The audience left.
Turn around behind him.
Turn here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Sweet!
Shut up, you're indecisive. I'm the head of the house and I make the decisions.
We need to make sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Oh, oh, oh, please.
I am from the Subayh tribe.
Buy it and register it under my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I assist you, people! What do you want?
God bless you.
Come on, folks, would you like some coffee?
You don't have anything to say, God bless you. You don't need anything, God willing.
You're saying you're sure, right? You'll expose us in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Oh mother, mother, I am mother.
Now, I don't know what he's doing to us.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Oh mum, don't tell dad.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
Of course he's going to kill you now.
Oh my god, I didn't break it on purpose.
Come on, Mama, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What are we going to glue, my son?
How can we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm afraid of him for you.
Oh no, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind?
Are you blind to break the bottle, are you blind?
Oh mother, hasn't a child come to you?
No, oh! My daughter didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This isn't right. Have some mercy on the boy!
This is not proper upbringing. May God guide you, my daughter!
What should we do now, mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I scared him from the cars in the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he is sweet, kind, and lovable, my daughter!
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from the devil and do not worry, God willing, it will be alright.
Okay, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Walid?
He mocks me.
Oh my god, my father is going to kill me with his beating.
Don't be alarmed, light of my eye!
Don't be alarmed, my dear.
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face is yellow.
God guide him, God guide him. Come with me, my son, just a little bit.
O God, the Giver.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come on, my son, don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want to.
But the poor man buys in anxiety, trembling, and in panic from something he didn't intend to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You must support him!
Don't say anything to him from my side, please. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where is he? Where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
What is here.
He's here! Where?
Enter, come on!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something new instead of the old one!
Come on, Nasser! Brother, we want to play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Oh dad, just this game and then we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, indeed, father.
Dad, come on, don't ruin the game.
Come on, Dad, don't take it seriously. Come on, come on, Dad, we'll study.
"What are you saying! Listen to me."
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't care.
I tell him not to listen to me.
Walk. Each one takes his book and starts studying.
Alright dad, put your phone in your pocket, we're studying dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Oh my God, I'm really confused. I don't know what to do?
I'm afraid if he knows, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course he asks me, why take him to the hospital?
I mean, what's the problem with telling him?
If he finds out that Waleed is wetting his bed, he'll kill him.
Ah! Mother, he is to blame. It's all because of him.
Oh, my daughter! This has a psychological impact.
The boy is not small, he is twelve years old now.
It's okay, daughter!
Are you coming to eat with us tomorrow? I'll give him some hints.
And I see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just an excuse, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he wets the bed every night.
My son pees in his bed every night, don't tell me the story.
He told me I had to take him to the hospital so they could treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
It's true.
They should take him to the hospital, son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He looks for a good, dry hose.
He beat him until his screams could be heard by the last person in the neighborhood.
Sit!
Oh my daughter, eat!
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it, go quickly, and take a shower. I'll get you some clothes. Come on!
Please, if you please.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
You call this a pass?
Khalid scored forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a ticket?
But their grades are good.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Come on, don't take them to your brother!
They need to be punished.
These are my children.
Alright, uncle, I swear, this is the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter, it's forbidden.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his brothers.
Enough, uncle, I'm dying, enough, enough, enough, enough. I'm dying, enough, uncle.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, what you'll see at the end of the year if none of you get fifty.
I'm going to drain the swimming pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They say it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
Excellent, by God! Khalid, outstanding.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent, Faisal!
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and were second in your class.
Teacher, he's crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
Professor, he is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
Oh, my son! I am talking to you!
Contact, contact his classmate.
He said he saw him at the school gate.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandmother's house.
No, he didn't go there.
I mean, where is he? Where is he?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
What's wrong with him, brother?
Ha, of course he failed, he's afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, but he was an excellent student and was second in his class.
However, he was too afraid to go home.
Because he only lost two points in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh God! Come here, Waleed.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, you've lost a mark or two, never mind. I won't say anything, won't scold or beat you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

Honorable Deputy, welcome and may God bless you.
I'd like to start with you at these unmatched prices that oil has reached.
Where might prices go?
Of course, where prices will go is a perplexing question.
Or what we call the power of the market.
Isn't it OPEC?
And not the producing countries?
And not the producing countries, OPEC has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with the subject.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and turned to oil and gold, or what is called "commodities marketing."
Investors lost confidence in the stock markets.
And gold as well.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in past years to $970 now.
And to this day, as mentioned earlier, around one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is expected to see a drop in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and the beginning of spring, it rises to over a hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
And economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
Regarding Iran, do you think Fallon's resignation is in light of political complexities? (Note: The translation may vary depending on the context, as "Fallon" and "resignation" are proper nouns that require clarification in a country-specific context.)
That accompanied and led today to the rise of most American newspapers and global press activities. It may affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today whatever it is.
Today, we are in the age of globalization and influence comes swiftly.
Unreal factors may influence
And created a kind of disruption in the market.
They also create types of political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but did not rule out other options that could be applied to Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, there is nothing confirmed now that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And perhaps there is what we have seen of what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector,
We'll see about these political tensions.
In the world's oil supply
On the contrary, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil going into storage.
There is absolutely no shortage in oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
In light of this insurance picture you're talking about regarding supply and that there are no obstacles in the supply.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will soar to record-high levels.
Oil prices may reach...
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the gulf represents great importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, and that's a fact.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it refers to
That means that in the event of any war with Iran, there will be no guarantee of the extent to which oil prices will rise.
God knows maybe he can make it today, we made it without him.
Wars to one hundred and seven to one hundred and ten dollars, and it may jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
And speculators took advantage of these tensions.
An investor only in oil.
Or what is called not investing in real investment, of course, neither future nor future marketing.
And it is called olive paper.
And it's all speculation in the oil paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
This could lead to more purchases and then to more upgrades for these people.
I wish April was April Fools' Month.
Inshallah, there won't be any.
It is said that China is coming to the region, and this is at the top of its main agenda.
China is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese man's bag.
And I can't predict what's going to happen to him, you know.
Will he start a war?
America is in transition.
Why doesn't the boy do something else?
Let's see what happens. If we're talking about April, it's coming soon. Just a few weeks and we'll be in April.
A scholar might pay
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Their production cost is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
See, we've been hearing this talk from the West and America for many years.
Use
"Until the end and do you remember the story of the Caspian War?"
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a close circle
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said: "It's strange that you talk among us in closed rooms."
Not the same way you speak in front of people.
Or, as they say in the media: for political reasons.
And of course, there is what is called double standards or two languages.
The language known to the Gulf countries.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And entering into them
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Region
I can't translate this.
Even with an air war or airstrike as they say
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually very punctual.
I don't agree with you.
We don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Situation, I mean non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (between parentheses) generosity
Arab generosity
Please give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil is...
The cause of the rise in oil prices
You are the citizens of the Gulf, members of OPEC, and the nations.
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on keeping their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price versus the decline of the U.S. dollar is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
Now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and the rate
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This comparison
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Certainly, it is in our interest at the moment for the dollar to fall.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You also become
The United States is reducing interest rates on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is linked to the dollar.
The first who, more than 100 years
Who started exporting the first barrel of oil exported from the United States of America.
And they were exported in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years, the world has been retreating and estimating.
And where is Norway today the third-largest oil-producing country.
And an oil exporter
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing is in US Dollars, not Qatari Riyal.
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information pointing to something other than this.
Those are the Gulf states.
You have secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and there isn't
And these agreements
If oil remains a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to cover these systems.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take OPEC as an example.
You have 66% of the sheriff's deputies.
Out of thirteen countries
Out of eighty-five barrels, forty percent go to OPEC.
There are many large countries in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles preventing pricing in another currency?
Search for pricing in another currency.
When will the adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, oh hero.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
Sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a direction and intention for change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me speak now why I am European.
Don't export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it's in their interest, their currency is high and expensive.
On the contrary
Here is where they have a loss.
With one euro, they export one and a half barrels.
No, you are the one losing out because your currency has dropped since it's pegged to the dollar.
After a great loss, a heavy loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical bond.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And they are now linked when you talk about disengagement.
Like marriage when we get married.
And you want to get divorced, it's not easy.
No, here.
Or that you've made a Catholic marriage with the dollar.
Costs must be studied in a certain way.
Inspected professionally and checked.
Similarly, Kuwait reduced twenty-five percent of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
You may adjust your currency's rate.
Today about the topic, but this means you have no intention of studying the topic or thinking about it.
The exam, of course, differs as stated by the Prime Minister.
He stated that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be in this study.
There's no direction in which you are the only ones going to this topic.
Similarly, Kuwait went alone. Why don't you follow its steps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
that these four Gulf states declare
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who personally support her.
Supports her.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What he achieved was from one or two countries.
Until the time of the currency came.
You're not going to save the situation now.
Of course, there are experts who can do this study.
And they will be the ones.
We're not experts, this needs a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush. Now, let's see what's happening today.
People started, I mean...
Certainly in a position of complicity
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar reached fourteen percent in 2007 and will reach fifteen percent next year.
He ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
The salaries of Qatar's residents eroded by between thirty-five and forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the size of the pay increases.
Many of the staff are in Qatar at least for the coming period, so stay tuned.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
And industrial expert Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah spoke about the dramatic rise in prices.
in oil that brought tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
About oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The United Arab Emirates owns 97.8% of the reserves of 10 billion barrels and produces 2.6 out of 10.
Tons and the report in the Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are among the highest revenues.
Saudi Arabia expected revenues in 2008 to reach one hundred and nine billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy years ago, sixty-six this year, and it was expected to be seventy-five.
Kuwait was sixty-six and forty-five.
Qatar has 21 billion barrels of oil in addition to 55 billion.
He farts, as other reports have said, and God forbid, I mean, we don't envy the happiness of the deputy.
Iraq is forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries topped with a thousand billion, meaning a trillion.
The dollar was a variety of imports.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, the rate was three percent.
In 2007 in Oman, it was 6.5 but will become 7. In Qatar, it was 13.75 but will become 15%.
That means people living in Qatar expect a higher cost of living, with higher prices for goods and merchandise.
Life is expensive, and prices are rising to high levels in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
This means you will increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they say you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct.
In the cabinet, against raising salaries.
That there is a problem and that the solution must be the ideal solution.
And patching is not a solution.
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And that's it.
The important thing is to solve inflation.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness issued the formation.
And he places
He lays strong foundations.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
Specialized in market research and published last February, just a few days ago.
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you're going to solve the inflation problem and let inflation devour people's income.
Many of them are here now.
Entering other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve the inflation problem and lower them again.
Repeat what they say is to balance the subject.
But now
And it's not a temporary solution.
Increase it in a bigger way.
So here.
To put an end to inflation.
Boredom always.
Because the increase was enormous last year, right?
The second point is
And those working in the private sector are not the same as those working in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
So now this question of increase must also be looked at fairly.
I don't know where I got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellency, not in Germany.
I tell you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
That majority
Among the Qataris who were working in government offices, some have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
He is facing a problem.
To move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
It offers good salaries.
Linked to what is called market forces
Or market power.
Those who come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because its salaries and wages are low.
Or with expenses they come.
"Tamam, with our clear understanding."
I'm not expecting events, and I'm not saying there will be a raise in salaries.
There's no hope left.
To control inflation
Let's give her some time.
Control inflation
And God willing, this is what was said in the report, that Qatar was in 2008.
God willing, we say so.
We observe that these numbers will change.
Sprinkle some of it on the people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything.
From inflation
Because spending
A lot on different projects.
"Allow me to take some questions from the viewers, and I hope everyone will ask direct questions. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, Abdulaziz?"
It relies on the ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is the OPEC dispute.
Secondly, the total oil revenues go directly to the governorates.
Then to the royal family and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the status quo will persist.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
I won't prolong the discussion. The brother mentioned the aspect of ruling systems and the issue of pegging the Qatari riyal and other Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world and have it pledge allegiance to her.
The U.S. deficit has reached $82 billion in trade with China.
The European Union stood by her side with $68 billion.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And now we, the Arab and Gulf oil-producing countries, are paying the price of its consequences.
You will end up with a confrontation between America.
Among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the issue may become complicated.
Purely military
The explosion had Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and American bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question is to Mohammed.
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I saw, Saeed doesn't want to reply.
The topic of decoupling from the dollar because the dollar is in decline.
With God's permission, you will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
He should imitate the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed, thank you. Now we ask for the final contribution from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed?
Good evening to you all.
Many thanks and thank you for the wonderful interview.
The request is for a salary increase. God willing, things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, but not in our salaries.
Insha'Allah, wishes will come true.
Okay, tell me your question quickly.
Your line is going to be cut off, do you have a question?
All that is because of the high prices, the increase has affected all goods, they are all exported.
I am from Europe.
In the Arab world, we have factories and workshops.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you for your time.
Now the issue of rising prices has become an important issue.
In the case of supporting the poor, the man told you to stand with the poor, Your Excellency the Minister.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for our brothers
Who knows Qatar?
This is not true for the State of Qatar.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
What will you do with this wealth? Where will it go?
What's included in the response?
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in a way that is neither genuine nor realistic.
The person who doesn't see with his eye.
If he comes and sees Qatar and all the huge developments taking place here.
You've grown so much. You're right, you're asking.
And every person has the right.
And since your population is small, where do you get people from?
Does this really mean you'll bring the bride from China, for example?
No, we won't issue, God willing.
The state is based on a plan and ...
Ideal independence from the amount of money coming from oil and gas, and we all know that oil and gas will run out one day.
that Qatar will become
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well
Focus on
And what will have a great impact.
In the post-oil and gas era
For you are not imitating Dubai.
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where people come to seek treatment.
There will be a media city that will adapt.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this change because it took us by surprise.
And we were not prepared for it, neither in terms of personnel, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it changes after thirty years.
And better yet
Today in vision
And vision
And the vision
Thank you, Your Honor, and I also thank our dear audience.
We hope you'll continue to follow us, as we strive to provide you with what you need.
Qatar's foreign policy appears murky to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
At the same time, Qatar had and still has relations with Israel.
From the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
Qatar presented.
Started
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Similarly, Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli captive.
Gilaad Shalit, the Qatari diplomatic hand reached out to him in a way that disturbed the largest Arab states.
What kind of power do you bring to a situation like this?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us via our website www.Aljazeera.net
Hello, Your Excellency the Ambassador
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Washed what was in stock.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine of Hijaz.
The agreement that was concluded with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which relations were restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was too long and needed a lot of answers without your final question.
What I believe you gave him
Especially on the Saudi topic.
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
Praise be to God, this was thanks to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years ago
It was bright, honorable, and based on trust.
I want to reduce the misunderstanding between the two parties.
This matter was dealt with and there were no conditions.
In any case
But there was understanding and clear intent among the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
And it is a seasonal but strategic relationship.
We hope that this doesn't continue but evolves.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I'd avoid a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia, so it is not diplomacy but faith.
The island's topic falls under the media.
Between the parties, many countries intervened as mediators.
Thinking that he might gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
At the expense of Saudi Arabia
Reconciliation within the Gulf House
I mean, unlike before.
This is part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, just an agreement of love and interest.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened previously?
It originally relied on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, and four.
And there must be unity.
And some differences were resolved based on this.
Between some Arab countries and tried to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain case, and another state has a different opinion.
It is considered two points of view.
Some observers think you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
For his criticism
Were you tired and decided to head in a different direction, and from there moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Okay, the idea is the same.
No, no, we don't enjoy either of them, we have nothing to do.
Dealing with any party in this manner
I mean that the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
Among them and I know that there is a very great understanding.
And you know that we founded
And there will be some kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
I started arguing with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram in the eighteenth issue of last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, it was stated that extensive investigations
In the Hezbollah network, a sabotage plot was uncovered.
Those targeting Egypt, three countries are involved: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And its struggle over the years
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And who is eager?
On Arab relations.
The first point
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we admit
Qatar is
A smaller-sized state
That could be part of such schemes.
Because we have suffered from interventions by other countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy
I'm trying to say that for the home, God can protect it, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
If there is stability in Egypt.
Why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
Pyramids don't bring things from behind the sun.
She said that the small state of Qatar had tried to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
I wanted to hold a conference parallel to the Arab summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we don't feel comfortable with him.
But I can say that we're certain.
That we
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
They forced our brothers in Egypt, and for this we blame the Egyptian officials.
The conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming to her.
Days of the fragrant scent of peace, the cause of peace, and that we
They were previously held in Egypt.
And then with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You don't have a problem with Adriel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive about it.
This sensitivity
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
One or two or three
The Gaza Conference is the one that was held.
That Egypt does not want to establish it in Qatar.
What is in Arabic.
In Qatar, and there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
More than two weeks
But we hold it before any prepared conference, the Kuwait conference which we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And with procrastination
The dispute began.
No small state can.
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said that afterward.
Okay, you're on the island.
The Israelis reported the previous day that there would be a meeting to cease hostilities before any speech or anyone or anything else.
What is this?
My brother allowed medicine and food to be brought in during the beating our brothers had to endure.
When they say that the door was firmly closed.
We can't bring in the trucks.
One day they'll tell us there's an agreement from the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the time we want to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
What matters to me is neither Fatah nor Hamas; our concern is for the millions, the half-millions, and the six-hundred-thousands who are suffering.
Governors who have no medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
Qatar's involvement in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
What is interference?
We didn't say how Egypt would resolve the situation, as that's within its purview.
One official said, "We have uncovered a major plot from this."
He hasn't yet told us what the story was.
I mean this official we
He tells us that Egypt is something big.
Alright, let's understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask so much of a great nation.
Because Egypt is for us
And I was invited to a conference where there were also provocations for them.
We were invited to a conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified stance.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know Turkey introduced things through Israel.
I'll be happy to see him enter our brothers' place in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that it is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If you do a good job, it's important to us.
Let me finish your question and introduction; it took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me.
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now in anger.
Egyptian regime officials are upon you.
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a wisdom he desired.
He wants to make peace.
That's why they intervene and prevent some countries from attending.
And I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
Have no disagreement with the Saudi, even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among the high-ranking officials
A big country where an official finds a small country doing such things.
That means you had one.
To take any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries decided.
Any country except Qatar would be good.
But these sensitivities will only make the situation worse. Why do you have to stick your nose into everything around you?
We want to resolve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why the sensitivities?
that some brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza, a revolution.
As the English say, blame the Italians.
When something happens.
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
Still unsolved
No, my priority is my country.
It is a priority for me to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then we'll see if I have enough time.
And the search for reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar attempted reconciliation.
And thinking about any Arab issue in which you can contribute as much as you can.
Why are you being provocative? Why don't you take it at face value?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
That sprang from his heart
Let me finish.
When an initiative for reconciliation was announced and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good, and I welcome this.
There are posts.
Certainly the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, television interview, or something like that, I will not respond to him.
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests
Also in response to the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and others is
And they try to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics or economics or otherwise, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics, and thus no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
Distorting Egypt's relations, undermining its role, and disrupting its connections with Turkey and the European Union.
First and foremost, we are few in number.
If we can pull this off
This is not correct.
There are accusations against you personally.
Paying money to Shalit's captors so that Qatar can take Shalit and surpass the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, but we've never paid a cent and no one has ever talked to us about giving money.
But this situation
We support Egypt in resolving issues, just as we support Egypt and still do in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue was resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and for Palestinian institutions to remain until the conflict is resolved.
And We said, "He is"
"We proposed it at the Arab League, but they said no. We did it because we believe there are people who don't want this."
But we did it cleverly.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
By God, I didn't know there was a problem.
I don't know whether it's from us or from them.
They decided now in the twelfth issue last April exclusively with Al Sharq newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to confront so-called Al Jazeera and counter its media campaigns.
It's a matter of days and everything will be over.
Are you afraid the island will become a thing of the past?
You mean we're living in a political adolescence now.
Similarly, the Emir of Qatar met with the Saudi King during his visit to Saudi Arabia.
We haven't reached out to them, nor have they reached out to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A compromise for a small state in the face of the large state of Egypt.
In Saudi Arabia, there is an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk.
So, what about the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him heavily.
Let me be honest with you.
Is it a disagreement on core policy?
I hope there is no personal dispute, because we have no personal disputes. I told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I ask you, you'd say two problems: Gaza and what else?
This situation affected all of us deeply.
We want to solve this psychologically, meaning to resolve this impasse.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But of course things got worse and were not resolved.
No, no, he was listening.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt...
They reproach us, and this is their right over us as brothers.
And we reproach them for this, it is their right as our younger brothers.
With the big countries, we don't want to compare ourselves to any big country.
I mean, Egypt is large in terms of satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution comes from heaven.
For us if there is anyone waiting for satisfaction.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with non-relatives or siblings.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a large country.
But if there is someone deceiving another person
I know that Israel is doing this to us.
Similarly, the previous American policy under the previous administration was with me or against me.
For I do not think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Similarly, if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that there are some guidelines even for large countries.
What controls your policies?
We have no will of our own, one thing moves us.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal matter.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of energy: Al Udeid Air Base and the island.
Can you say this isn't strength?
Our faith in God is our confidence.
Or seeing His Highness the Prince, may God protect him.
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want about big Qatar or not.
But we have a point of view.
First, we expelled the Israeli office and closed it down.
First, they said to lock the office, so we did. We locked it, but they got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team called Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans and Europeans, and these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Conspiracies
Those who forgot.
This is the problem: we've reached a certain point, and then what?
Tell me now.
In bullet points, how will the problem with Egypt be solved?
Based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to look at him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on that.
But some of the crew
I have to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public or government opinion, or else leading the nonsense.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a superpower.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how this is going to happen.
And I know that there is a time for meaning.
And there will be a time for either of us.
If it was up to me
Or from them
Large Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will find this topic.
You mean that life still goes on.
That means we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you're speaking in.
If someone gives us a hand, we'll give them an arm.
Now His Highness Sheikh
We used to run.
Unless we have a solid foundation and are prepared, we are not ready to run for Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There's a lot of talk about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they have been affected by this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or high-ranking positions.
You know we usually don't cancel jobs once they're scheduled.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where demands change, they cancel one and bring in another.
This is a matter of supply and demand; some nationalities have increased, while others have decreased.
Converted quickly
The office was there.
We've turned the office upside down, so it's best we leave now.
We used to run it on days when there were campaigns, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we closed it for Netanyahu to fix it.
He was a guest.
And it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
So it was an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when relations, as they say, were good. We honor her now, which is a bit difficult.
There's no reason now that prompts you to open the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no other reasons.
Made a lot of money
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me clarify, our relations with America are strategic.
In some things, and that is it.
What's the most important thing?
In our region, there are matters regarding the resolution of certain issues where we disagreed with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
Serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
These are our friends, and we don't deny that.
What's the story in Iran? What impact could it have on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve your issues.
Among them
With their usual methods, I'm sure they'll be able to overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
Important for our region, the Gulf, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability for this region.
And we intervene whenever a party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
And Lebanese groups
How to see
Yemen has no role for you, or they've just taken a stance.
Listen, it's well-known that we supported unity when most Arab countries were almost against the unity of Yemen.
We are the only Arab and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
As for the south, we have spoken with Yemen, and His Highness the Amir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
I explained to him that our goal is to stabilize Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
They didn't respect this agreement, and I don't want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me, frankly.
Is this Qatar that took this position and then was accused of paying money to Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in these matters.
He who stands for unity does not stand against it.
Another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
We don't mind, but to be honest, I'm shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time is up, but briefly tell me about these problems you faced due to your attempt to solve problems, will you change your policies to intervene in other Arab problems?
I wish His Highness would listen to me, I see no need for that.
And he was in a great display once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been better than the fifty billion dollar headache.
But I say it with conviction, because perhaps the time in the Arab world now
Not allowed under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
Perhaps even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
Regarding what happened to the agreement in Doha.
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To mandate the committee and provide it with all necessary support.
Discussion of Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
When there was an Arab consensus
We went to New York and were able to make a somewhat balanced decision.
And we discussed this in detail, that both parties were concerned.
We tried our best not to hear it, otherwise there wouldn't be any.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality on the ground and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was a determination.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly affects it.
Peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to have this position.
Under these conditions
Unfortunately
External effects
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is one, won't be the number one problem.
I know that perhaps it's not the right time yet, maybe it's too early to talk about the scenes, but
What brought you here?
Stop talking about the engagement on Earth for now.
I didn't delay a single second.
I know exactly what was happening, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what had happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
I will present the idea that His Highness approved and supported.
Where will all the Lebanese leaders be present?
Because here in Beirut, you'll have to go to an area where everyone is.
While they are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but our idea from the start was
And this was the most important decision the two of them had made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I believe that has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
To reach a fair solution for both parties.
And that there is a solution and no one will lose.
Before you make any move
Consultations took place at the Arab League and we found support.
What did we make?
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he recommended to me
To lock them up and confiscate their mobile phones
They were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why do they want the solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred...
And this is the time.
There is tension in Somalia, and there is tension in Sudan.
There are many ongoing issues in the world.
And every time we put out a fire.
It is in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign intervention.
And we try our best.
Sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
At a point being discussed
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
We need self-examination in the Arab world.
Due to Arab disputes.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
In the war of seventy-three
When Arabs agree on a solution to an issue.
I think it's in her interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Opening of Wisdom
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because here in the Arab world, we face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
We have no power nor authority.
And how can we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
We Arabs have at least a minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
While we were watching
Our difference as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
And the Arab states
It's not so much betrayal as it is a kind of...
Jealousy, what's the word?
This is a case that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think.
Okay, will you make this wish a reality and actually call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
He joined the conversation halfway through.
If it is possible for us to play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if...
We are eager to find solutions, and I am sure of their wisdom.
They might reach a mutual understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relations improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't confirm that this is what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the presence of a general Arab awakening.
But I can't say that what happened in Lebanon...
This can be interpreted on the ground as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
In an escalation of U.S.-Iranian relations, and possibly in other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can't just deliver food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready, and His Highness is always ready.
More than 1.5 million Palestinians are besieged.
And their prophets do not possess weapons or support.
They are doing all this.
No electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we only provide them with food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them could continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
Leave illusions behind.
The Palestinian divide is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit the crime.
This is a serious matter; they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
They are obliged to request until they return again to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
Resolve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and has been conveyed to all concerned parties that we...
We won't be part of it and we won't accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Cooperation with Iran and peaceful good neighborliness
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
No, never.
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if there's no problem.
Frankly, Your Honor, we were facing a major setback, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
He linked what happened to what they announced.
Maybe these are disparate pieces of information that don't relate to each other, but what happened?
This is what led you to this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul, I know if it had specific dates before.
You knew there were negotiations.
Always looking for a solution.
Undoubtedly, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led by
Leading to a positive outcome, we gathered some parties from various sources.
And we started talking.
In this paper, there is an Arab and Qatari approach.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the subjects one by one.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And get rid of this obstacle.
And he was free from it.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
Don't think about your role now.
Listen, the most important thing is to stay away from the lights.
You have no regional ambitions.
Or even control another state or something because our state
Our size... We take pride in ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving issues with our fellow peers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
She has countries that are
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Allow some small countries to take on this role and support them.
In some things, it's excellent; in others, good; and in some things, less than good.
One last question, Your Excellency.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or the Consolidation of Hostility
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
We fix what's wrong in the Arab countries.
To choose an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
At the national and regional levels
But if we designed
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
and international efforts to end the ongoing war on Gaza.
We start by requesting a meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
As if you'd changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be part of this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Confronting our brothers in Gaza
Conditions require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not underestimate the Arab summit.
In fact, when we previously went with the idea of the Arab summit
Not only through a Security Council resolution but also through
They are not touched, nor is their honor diminished.
Let me put it in another sentence.
And we are disciplined.
That the street is no longer bearable, if we, as responsible for the Arab street, endure.
He won't be able to bear it.
When we were in Egypt
There was written consent from ten to eleven o'clock.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
To hold on to it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if they have an opinion about the meeting.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important subject.
Because our goal is not advertising, our goal is to find...
So the summit ignored it.
We even ask ourselves
We're going to press the other poor end.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's stay on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit attended by whoever attends.
We found the majority of our brothers support the holding of the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia, in Latin America.
Unsolved
They were classified as moderate countries.
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No nation allows interference, whether good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is this a question?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
It's as if it's written in our destiny to be involved in an internal Arab conflict.
Alright, then we'll go to the Security Council.
There's no Security Council resolution.
God willing, after Israel finishes its mission.
The second Arab ministerial meeting you were invited to attend.
which was dominated by discussions, disagreements, and sharp altercations
There's an important point.
This is not what matters.
When we request a meeting
Terminal stations
No peace anymore.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there is a party that tells you we must wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace talks with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose in this.
In a greater loss than the one we've suffered now, but we were always respectful, polite, and adhered to the decisions since the truce.
You say that arguments aren't important.
There was someone who wished Hamas would be destroyed and things like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to talk about people.
It's important for us to be men for ourselves and men for our state.
We make the policies of our countries.
Who does these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone, I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will be his agenda?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the dispute here is if Israel implements the decision immediately.
We can say there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven, I'm sure there will be difficulties.
The failure of the international community to ask questions is not significant, and if it did, ...
He gets shy.
The situation
See if they did something to the Jew and the Israeli.
To claim their rights
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs go to the Security Council
They agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try for us.
Because we are in the Arab world and there are a lot of people, and you can see how the Arab street interacts with this.
But this decision is important.
With the case of inviting our bosses one after another.
In the end, they said there was nothing, which was a lie.
So, are we now like Germany, or are we still demanding more?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who initiated the attack, just say your information was incorrect.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We, the Arabs, are a few of us.
How did he get so tired?
For his contribution
In a way as if it were fate and God's doing.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Arabs or some people considered the decision of 1860 significant.
And our countrymen have worked hard to pass this decision.
That was issued by the Security Council.
I don't want to say whether it was a victory or not.
And what leads to
Let's assume that victory
What are we going to do?
We are supposed to disagree with the rest of the decision.
But I assure you, we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will agree to the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
This means that we...
Will you have an alternative or something better, you who are calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
Meanwhile, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group dominate another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start trying to make plans.
Once they held a gathering, I don't know if it was Arab, European, intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And once they did that, I mean we engaged.
In implementation
What is asked of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Of course I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about the thing I'm talking about.
The follow-ups because the Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I was going to talk about the subject two years ago, but specifically about the issue of the decision.
Do you have any reservations about it?
Not issued or implemented
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
Everyone was required to have the same viewpoint.
Not everyone has to share the same opinion, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza for two years, you said parties.
The victory of one group over another that participated in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with all that's happening now in Gaza.
We are partially informed.
On the subject, let me tell you we don't know everything.
But I know.
Palestinian conflict
It was funded at the Arab and international levels.
And if fueled, it wouldn't differ much.
And after the elections...
And Hamas came and took power.
By a majority vote
We should have given them a chance and seen.
They want reform, or they are still revolutionaries who only know the gun and fighting.
But the day they came.
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not come to power.
Some say an assault has just occurred.
Made by Hamas who broke the truce or those Palestinians from Gaza who broke the truce.
Truce
While the Palestinian people in Gaza have been starving for two years.
This is perfect.
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that's not my concern in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
Then who should decide?
This or that, not every sovereign state gets to choose.
Our government
The main problem is
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we worked hard, we worked hard to fuel the conflict.
But it is clear that we were asked to allow one group to prevail over another because this group...
Do we consider them terrorists or not?
Everything that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party to provide them with a decent life.
They didn't do anything to them.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, as you said you had been.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has not yet accepted.
And there is the Egyptian Initiative for Unity
And Egypt in Cairo
Those Egyptian efforts
Not at all, not a trick.
This is required for an important role.
Similarly, Egypt's borders are adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
We
And that we will not stop the chaos now.
In Gaza and we are preparing people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
There must be.
And therefore, we always ask them for a big role.
What was announced?
Does this mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give a chance for success or to study.
I think his chances of success are good.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Make Palestinian viewpoints more similar.
And those who argue against the initiative are the ones harmed in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When the decision 1860 was issued.
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we have.
We don't want to hear any party.
But, by God, I wanted it, the day the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the league, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We won't let the government control us.
To be our goal, not to build our policy
To remain in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't read its articles.
Do you think, in principle, that this could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860, as some people have suggested?
Balanced role
Now is neither tomorrow nor the day after tomorrow because
Every day that passes
There's going to be bloodshed for our brothers over there.
Therefore, we do not want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter, and when they finish their mission we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and take it into account.
I want to clarify everything you said.
Now we need to solve the problem.
And not in the way Israel wants.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does this translate?
Arab space
Undoubtedly, it's a special situation.
And the depth of Arabic
Accessible entrance for people with disabilities (Arabic)
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to conflicts.
Partly because of perspective, everyone thinks their perspective is the best.
And there's another person who thinks his viewpoint is better.
Where is the conscience? How do you allow people to respect and realize that there is an Arab decision?
Or they'll catch us one by one.
"In the end, he said it's fine to give them an extra two or three days so we can contact them and bring the guys together to be on equal footing and solve the problem."
We need to rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we engage with them.
At the Arab level
But so far
At least we tell them no.
Within the framework of the required stance from Qatar, positions such as, we will return to this point later, but
Also in the field at the same time I heard.
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement
Firstly, everything said by Brother Khalid Mish'al is unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't you sit with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing Israel's conditions also imposes conditions.
Let them impose their conditions, isn't it their right to impose conditions while Israel does so?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
We are cattle and should not listen to the talk of the common people. Once they told me De Gaulle didn't listen.
It is quite different; first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
With or without allies, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
Now what are we talking about?
This is an Arab gift that we should take.
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
These rows of requests can be fulfilled.
Similarly, many of those criticizing Qatar in this situation are demanding...
What's the actor talking about? The office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
To cut ties, all connections, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They only want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, in this one and in more difficult decisions.
More than this decision.
We must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one should sell their brother for spiritual, material, or monetary gains, or even call it so.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
The good Chavez is a different matter, he has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five permanent member ambassadors present the arguments of these films.
We're done with that, and the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, Your Highness.
Or demanding that the Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think it would work if we put it in a single Arabic frame?
But we demand an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor that we encourage"
How are we going to unite Syria, Lebanon, and the other countries when there are Arab countries that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
Change in Arab relations
This is the policy currently followed among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already over.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Give an example if she regained her lands.
The situation in Gaza is going to change, they are far away.
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals of Israel, that is, the practical goals of Israel.
A day it strikes a person, a day it punishes a person, and a day it pleases a person.
An example of what happened in Lebanon, for them, is not a good example.
The sample solution that became available in Lebanon.
I consider him good.
For lunch
The problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their disputes over power
On the distribution of power
This differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
Smarter than the Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And here's the problem.
His Highness Sheikh
We only have a few minutes if we want to finish this matter. Where could it lead us?
"And diplomacy"
How can this process end?
Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you.
Accepts or rejects
And help
This is what we agreed on.
Bacon failed Arabic
From a strategic standpoint
But from the Palestinian side
There were efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Why not before now?
It's not so much a question of initiative as we feel.
We help those who solve the problem without mentioning the name of Qatar, as some people have a problem with mentioning Qatar.
Don't mention the summit, as there is a summit taking place in March.
If we take an initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And you do not place a burden upon them.
Because history doesn't spare us if we pressure them.
Through this initiative, we met with all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day, which was postponed due to the Security Council.
God willing, we want to progress and we want our Arab brothers to help us as much as they can in this matter.
And we hope to keep her out of the competition.
Arab competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at some point.
And these are our problems, right? We fight with each other and disagree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait on the nineteenth of next month, I believe, of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as mentioned and explained by your excellencies.
Does the Arab climate facilitate it being the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, any summit held in a brotherly country, we attend.
And we have no objection to attending any summit.
But what if it becomes a political summit?
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
Late even if it's ten days from now.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they've been struck for twenty-five days?
Will be
Are they saying the Arabs couldn't meet?
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this conference was decided upon in advance and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own unique way
Therefore
"And enter in peace."
And say that this is guaranteed.
For this meeting
Thank you to the audience for watching.
The coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a special bill
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have also delivered over seventy-five lectures, booklets, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
When referring to people with disabilities, do we say "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities" as you mentioned?
Good evening first
Taken from the perspective of a culture of human rights or human rights because people with disabilities
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.
Good news
This then resulted in his disability in trying to adapt to society.
The medical concept was prevalent at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Special education and pedagogical teaching appeared.
This category has changed.
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
What are the standard rules from which you were derived?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And expedite the steps towards the emergence of an international agreement, which was legally binding and distinctive in terms of rules in this regard.
This term sets a fundamental condition or core rule.
This treats these people as human beings, as persons.
As the terminology changes as you mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group by society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
That the Arab world stood out or differed
However, legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but for reasons perhaps due to lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say, that culture exists but there is a lack of resources, and sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws, but
But unfortunately, awareness is still low despite the existence of a culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developed countries are of working age.
And suffers from unemployment
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or the presence of mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
In addition to the disabilities, they will be in remote and distant areas.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise awareness and support.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating many religious centers, so to speak
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things we thank God for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Set an agenda
Or include these humanitarian organizations' agendas to include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating conditions of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't call it, and I agree with you that it's in decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
When placed in the social context within the political and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be... (the rest of the sentence is missing in the input)
While they are from marginalized groups
In a country like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
It was actually implemented on the ground, and if I wanted to give an example, I would say
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities and health issues between this strategy and other programs
That we tried to include that as well.
Ground-based organizational operations
Kamal Kiro is with us now from Syria. Welcome!
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiraw.
Solomon Kiro, please come in, Solomon.
My regards to you and Madam Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
Cognitive blockage means that the healthy individual was the result of what became a pressure factor leading to cognitive blockage.
My son was disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment. He suffered brain damage and is still undergoing treatment, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know as they know their children.
The whole point without showing off.
And there are values in the West.
People agreed on it, but...
Some of them are hypocrites or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, do not take wisdom from them.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
We go back to our guest for comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any intellectual disability.
Yes, it is among the global rankings.
Certainly, there are mental and intellectual disabilities, as they are called.
Are there sensory disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments, among these disabilities?
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
Action and reaction occur in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Certainly, addressing the topic of disability has taken a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to address and work on was ...
In other words, the right of everyone.
Until they provide for them
and various qualification aspects to ensure their ability to join schools as well as labor organizations
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There have been some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, they are on this international committee.
Me too, I mean as a special rapporteur.
The fact that my work was not directly related to this was positive for me.
Those who supported this position.
I've seen her in many meetings, for example, the international conference.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Disabled by these constraints or shortcomings
An example concerning legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
Unfortunately, the United Nations delayed that a bit during preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and entities
For example, and I'll end with this.
Governments and non-governmental organizations in the world member states of the United States
We administered another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To find out how far disability programs are included in their schedules.
If there are dedicated budgets for participation for people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues
We receive most of the calls. With us now is the Egyptian Naji from Algeria. Welcome, Naji.
Upon you also
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly should be blamed.
I wanted to ask, I am physically disabled already.
Okay, we'll ask her. I'm Egyptian from Algeria. Thanks, Ahmed.
Hello to Al-Halbawi from Greece.
Good evening, Madam, and good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even taking them on seasonal tourism - this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
All we're talking about is within the realm of unproductive discussion, thank you.
Sister Hassa mentioned the financial shortcomings.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profit of every institution in the world.
This should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will address the needs of many disabled people, war victims, and others.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
An Egyptian survivor wonders and mentions his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, that is, across Algeria.
Needs within the community must be met within that community itself.
The same rights that should come to any other person.
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
So, I really call from here, from this platform, governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are within the existing agendas.
No, there's no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of a disabled person or there is no need for this if the state provides them.
They are committed and must actually implement.
I advise him first to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it's within my national scope and it should be within this scope.
I touched upon the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there are many countries that have signed it but have not complied with it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why aren't there any laws?
It is certain that we live in a human society, which means there are many errors alongside many good things.
Certainly, many agreements, and certainly many treaties, do not have a literal obligation in them.
Or an ideal commitment from many countries that have joined numerous conventions such as "CEDAW" and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know it.
But the question of adopting an agreement and organizing for it
First, we will ensure at least the existence of awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, and then gradually it grows until it reaches the entire society.
As well as our commitment to prepare and submit reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
According to reports, she served as a rapporteur at the United Nations.
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
There is a comparative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important for people with disabilities to be... (complete the sentence according to the context)
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute, will tell us.
Mr. Naji is going to talk about it. Long live Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Blind.
And chaired by H.E. Sheikhessa Hessa.
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar
And the President, indeed, Sheikh Hassa had a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is in fact
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And in particular, the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
That these countries implement the international convention.
To serve people with special needs, it is essential to...
We really need someone who can implement this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
Here we continue our discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other topics.
Al Jazeera Mubasher Text Messaging Service
Dear viewers, welcome to today's episode with our esteemed guest, Sheikhessa Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability International Support Fund
Disability, and it is obligatory for all countries to provide funding. What is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Mission
After working for six years, there was no meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria
And I always thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
Praise be to Allah who established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects.
Yes, this lack of support indicates something.
I mean, like it was raised initially and this point is always raised.
Circumstances of ordinary people
So how is taking care of people with disabilities or caring for the disabled called?
This means, if there's a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
Disabled, refugee, and homeless children and women
All these we may actually reach to some degree called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And there are these voices that always demand and never get tired or weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't you allocate a part, please?
In favor of these programs and projects
As he has presented, and I thank him greatly from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me regarding the payment of financial obligations.
Does the funding to assist people with disabilities cover only developing countries and Arab states, or?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person before me, the Swede, yes.
Also some countries of the European Union
And certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that perhaps have not
Until you know about the existence of this special course
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
In the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately, it was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have with us Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And upon you too.
Hello, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa
Almost ten.
We noticed that this girl suffers from a psychological disability.
What is your role towards a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even when we try to maintain...
What is your role towards Qatari girls' children?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and in the presence of Bahja Al-Karwan from Kuwait. Welcome!
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in its dark place?
Those with special needs can be categorized.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We are capable of breaking the psychological barrier between us and them.
By boosting individual morale
Spend it on this noble cause.
This if we are truly believers.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With utmost gratitude and appreciation to her, and thank you to the State of Qatar for all it has provided to people with determination.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
And for your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question concerns prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, aside from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level resulted from families and consanguineous marriages.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leads to disability
Many thanks to the noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a mental disability go?
And who should he go to?
In every country
Surely there are services that provide all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities such as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
Schools
Previously, there was
Isn't it the special education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Higher Council, that I am referring to?
The noble standard-bearer from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
Scientific papers and the like
I work for organizations that focus only on disability, but even within those campaigns.
Programs for women
All this has attracted many campaigns and programs to reproductive health.
I've spoken about this aspect.
Healthy strategies implementation
Based on awareness.
To demonstrate the risks of consanguineous marriage
And genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but certainly need time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but there must be a legal commitment, in other words.
Yes, the Bahja Caravan inquired and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
Let's first help those with disabilities.
Yes, there are statistical estimates carried out by the World Health Organization for the world as a whole.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Their group is made up of women.
But these numbers double.
Like studying in South Africa where they saw and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three are disabled.
And since the Arab region has become the undisputed conflict zone
Even the proposal presented by Karwan Behjat
One percent won't be enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups
Frankly and honestly, I don't think it fits with
That requires addressing their problems and needs.
Emphasize that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Those conducted by governments typically do not count people with disabilities.
True, and this is linked to the culture and constraints of society sometimes.
When the census is taken by
Stakeholders
There is a disabled person in the house.
The only question asked was whether there was a disabled person or not.
The department concerned with this matter and the people involved there.
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend obtaining more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, male or female.
And whether or not he received help.
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we didn't reach an accurate conclusion.
Similarly, attention and care must be continuous. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with special needs.
And I thank His Highness the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, for embracing this category.
I am truly proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her important role
Hello, Latifa Al-Messafer
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much to Latifa Al-Misfer from Qatar for joining us now.
Hello, Abdul Karim from Jordan. We welcome you.
Come on, Karim, we're listening to you.
Peace be upon you too.
Please, I have a comment.
First, I am a sound engineer and I worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month to raise awareness about speech and hearing problems.
We were holding conferences, lectures, and awareness sessions on hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, he offers new and good services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
In addition to our private institutes
They get good support.
Okay, Karim, you have a direct question only due to time constraints. I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, there are excellent services, and I think they are outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I'll come back later to the issue of agreement.
What is needed as soon as it gets approvals and joins him.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it is based on the rights of these people, regardless of
What's up?
What should be done during that period for people with disabilities and why?
And I hope now that it happens.
Of course, I wish either...
I hope that this research or study will be measured and that more high-quality research will be conducted in this field.
It also became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They have a role beyond just receiving rights; they receive rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We have with us now the presenter of the league and cup program on Al Kass channel, Lana, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the distinguished captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Anyone can congratulate publicly, Lana please.
I had a studio open for five hours, and two the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens; they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the chance to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are from the sports field and one of the experts in this area, and the most knowledgeable about these lines and this field.
Because even our file
Competitive, meaning we deserve the six-vote margin between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That was because our file was rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors. It was very well supported, for example, by the stadiums.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there was a low percentage, like in America.
Some countries may be ready, not needing to provide venues, and preparing some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
The economic, political, and health sectors are affected, I think.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, this is a great achievement especially for us, even you saw how the non-athletes were very happy.
Inshallah, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
While I was driving and listening to the radio
In the moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course we had the sunroof open.
So my friend's body went through the sunroof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we put on our hazard lights and started our own party.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event to a great extent.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
Many media outlets and channels from around the world were present.
I became a major teacher, very clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Sure, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
I believe it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Okay, do they mention the required attributes to join the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
This has fundamental principles and well-planned mathematical strategies for football.
Alright, what are the rules and principles that a player should uphold?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Difficult, constant training and discipline.
All these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I believe every stage has a unique advantage.
She has unique feelings and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
Very nice
It keeps your body fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Just as everyone watches football matches, you'll automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Are media workers confined to one side?
What limits you to one part?
This is an open field, not just for football.
They are all sports, but sports are great.
Ali, later there are other important issues I'd like to discuss.
Would you wish to go back in time to be twenty-two again?
Yes, what did you wish for?
Of course, everyone dreams of this opportunity, especially since it's the World Cup. Any player now...
Anyone who watches just a World Cup match is happy, so imagine how it would be to play in the World Cup?
God willing, they will succeed and make the most of their opportunity.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm on vacation now, but...
Her return to the championships after an absence of twelve years from the Gulf Cup.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and beautiful memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar TV will become like a university that graduates large batches of media professionals.
Our Dorian is brave, and God willing, he will win many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you are well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Yesterday, of course, in the studio, we talked about many players.
So I think some of the young men who were watching us think you're...
Needs
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I had a great opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
Alhamdulillah, I was able to secure my place with the team in the Asian Cup.
And my situation with the team is excellent.
How can we make sports a social issue?
And beyond Qatar, how can we engage women, children, and youth in sports?
Everything is connected, everything is complementary to sport.
Women play a role in all sports fields.
As it expands, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, realizes the importance of sport.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to nurture a sports-conscious generation from an early age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an effective building.
It is essential for the new generation of athletes.
But we need to be firm and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in every competition match between different clubs?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we face in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association has yet to find a way to attract the public.
What methods do we use to attract them to attend football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending classes.
The media plays a fundamental role, by the way, in public abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, FIFA has many plans and steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs, some club departments organize some activities and events.
For the audience, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
They love what they do and believe in their capabilities. As I said, they don't just need financial support, moral support is also very crucial.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
Alright, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Lana please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
God willing, Captain Ali, your final words you'd like to say in this interview?
Congratulations and I wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and Knowledgeable Player. I wish you success in your sporting progress and life. God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs are popular nowadays; nevertheless, they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we're discussing this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We learn more about them through the interview that brings us together live.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new style of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scenes.
I'm from the West, particularly America, which is where rap comes from.
Before we start talking about rap,
The use of any word without any reserve is boldness.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding writing words,
Most rabbis write their own words.
So, we'll learn all these many crucial details from two people deeply immersed in this field.
They make a cute couple.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Hello with us, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
It turned out that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen.
Including fun, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are the drawing of an artist and the tune of a poet.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of lyrical content?
Two thousand and ten.
Do you feel that people love buying rap music CDs?
Diversity in ages
In many families and among many people, they hear more than before.
There was something like a website.
How many are you in this band so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform rap.
You could also say the singer, the rapper,
He's the one who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Okay!
I ask him to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you produced, Salman, Youssef, anyone in the same band.
I didn't think it would be on CD and available in stores.
But you know, if I'm alone it means I'll make the album and release it on the market, which is difficult for commercial recording and procedures.
Come on, why didn't you think of that? You're 25 years old and it's always a one-hand clap.
"There should be two of you, but if God wills, you will have twenty-five hands. May God preserve you all together, young and brothers."
Marketing a CD across multiple websites.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think she has thirteen songs.
Registration is not like it is now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
Its quality is poor, not like now, but clear.
Burned almost fifty CDs.
There is rap, I can't say there isn't because maybe there are young people who have known this art for ten years.
What was strong like the record and I believe the distribution during this time, now the situation has changed.
Especially since there is diversity in music, a wide range of techno music genres now exist.
Halryael and the artists who bring us a collection of beautiful songs.
Similarly, we would like to talk about the parties you attended.
See, the party we attended in Doha is one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We sneaked to see the audience.
We were surprised; we didn't expect this huge number.
And we were also surprised by the presence of more civilized families.
More than the youth
The organization was amazing.
We were a bit nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect all this attendance.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It took a long time, as there were many songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or lyrics you've written, that the audience, especially the youth, would love.
Let's hear a few words for the audience.
Can we hear it live?
Take your time.
Walk ahead, Salem.
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
One feels like attending the program in the morning.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They have no idea about it.
The words are random.
Okay, I've heard your songs, now give me some lyrics from your previous songs.
See, not all songs are random, or as they say in English, "freestyle."
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning invitation program
We are live on television, for the public.
Let's see what they will offer, one by one, two, one.
Together from Doha's morning
The sweet song you just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He won't find it easy to execute.
So everyone writes.
Sure, I think every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can write after loving sports.
Or love of the countryside
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
Qatar awaits Doha's brilliance in hosting the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate that occasion
We are broadcasting this segment live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's see this live image together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Hamad International Airport this morning to continue its journey.
Preparations to host the massive continental event
We return to our guests Youssef and Salman, whose presence we enjoy.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it by this name?
Currently, frankly, we
We're planning a party, but we're not sure yet.
But, you're working on a party that will be announced, God willing, Yusuf.
If God wills, but don't take it for granted, we're still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Similarly, Salman, where do you all, twenty-five people, gather?
Where do you meet, and how do you gather all the ideas?
Sure, there are shared songs.
There's no need for anyone like Salman or Yusuf or any of you to sing an entire song.
There must be cooperation among all of you.
Frankly, it's hard to get all twenty-five in one place.
I start calling Youssef and the guys and ask them to gather in one place.
Contemplate the song and the lyrics.
And there's a second way.
I register my spot.
And continue.
So record it and give it back to me.
And see other experiences
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Sure, always.
Artists have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to develop our own unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone and the same phrasing,
We are not producing anything new, we want to do something that... (complete the sentence according to context)
So we benefited from them a little.
Yes, in the Gulf there is also a large group of Gulf youth.
In a primitive way, let's watch the report together for learning and enjoyment, let's watch it together.
The talents some people have are strange.
Using very primitive tools.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Duwail
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the suitable location to dig the well, but with the expert, you can.
Discover, or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our people and ancestors
I was seeking help from experts to locate the wells.
To dig or drill
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
What are modern technologies?
Soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And its underground rivers
Pomegranate seeds
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of discovering watercourses is applied scientifically.
To close, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back
Alright, from here we start marking.
And here, the table ends.
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
To understand the sensitivity of the "Twoo" movement
I went to many places.
Means a success rate of ninety-nine percent.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What is truly astonishing is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to Allah, Who taught mankind that which they knew not. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Who had a band and more than one CD?
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song with a more intense theme.
When dealing with a problem, etc., there are many issues.
See him as a role model for me.
Will of God
And at the same time, we want
Played a wide range of songs
As much as possible
From time to time, let's stay in touch with you.
So we can keep up with the band's latest news.
But let's emphasize the band's name.
These are rabbits.
We returned to our guests on the corniche, enjoying the pleasant weather.
We are with you live via this live broadcast.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you welcome the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and the wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they'll represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, may God bless you again.
Subscriptions sometimes end.
We tried to contact the company, but no one responded.
As a team, you need to develop yourselves, people in...
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You'll find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together in this great production.
You compose and match images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or just download it from YouTube and other video sites you can watch.
In some ways, we've done it before.
There are a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company that certifies you, or the lack of a website.
You really need a place where you can all meet as a band.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill and achieve?
"Who will take care of us?"
And arrange an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
As a hobby, no more.
Yes, by God, we participated in some things, in some series.
We hope the situation improves.
And we will have someone who supports us and stays with us.
Ah, Salman, we also want to know what your wishes are?
My only wish is to produce a video clip.
We wish you success.
We hope all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is very beautiful and popular art.
And it delivers a message, as I just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Greet the group, and we wish you success.
We'll finish with a song produced especially for the show.
This is the Cat Dub and DJ GMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Lady Bobo with Qatar Telecom.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning invitation program
We are live on television, for the public.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Let's see what they will offer, one by one, two, one.
Together from Doha's morning
Produced by Hassan Neama, presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
It can be repeated and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a shopping trolley
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will display the components of this product.
This was also a great and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the item.
Make shopping easy for the buyer.
He can bring up all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects?
The details are complete.
Or ambition, for example there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Deals with traffic issues.
He deals with traffic congestion and other issues such as the parking problem. He was very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are still surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if I should mention some of the projects I've done or not.
For example, for public transport, the brilliant idea is
As soon as the man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And converge at a single point.
I assume that all the viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, it's like an ATM, for instance.
For women, for example I have a card
I go in and say I need a T-shirt.
This is, for example, for some shops, or if you lose things at home like the key.
This is missing, for example, the office key.
We have a primary goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
His Highness's wife
At an early age, this has great significance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
We also invited speakers and orators.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To offer their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be present and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that central idea.
Diverse and varied skills for children
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
It's all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing such talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Innovation Center for Girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very important role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on them.
Engaging and encouraging children, as each program relies on institutional partnerships.
According to the project and establishment manager
What changes?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and great support.
And faster.
We are now, in partnership with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there are many programs with collaboration.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
As we work on it, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, future generations, and youth
What's the last word you want to say to the parents and children who are watching now and interested in joining the center?
More than what we offer them now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We should take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It is important to provide care and attention to the child.
Even spiritually, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
Encourage him, so we encourage the parents.
Pay more attention to a child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
We toured the exhibition and saw their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And dreams come true, many of them have come true and become reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there success.
Our hearts are with you.
Will of God
Of different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is considered a pioneer and deserves to be implemented.
To talk more about this national exhibition
And the Child Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, briefly tell us about the exhibition.
There were a lot of activities, of course. What do you say about them?
The children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
It was under the patronage of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
You'll grow until you're twenty and thirty.
We started training children to envision Qatar 2030 across all three of its axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I suppose they already have a broad mind.
But why should we help him?
I suppose their minds will expand more and more.
Sir, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar tomorrow.
We felt it when we were walking with the kids, when the boy said to the minister,
I'd like you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project for twenty to thirty minutes.
A child thinking about the future in twenty years.
Their expression of love for their countries in the field they care about.
There must be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
There were also the winners of the first prize of the Arab League.
Sure, all the children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a set schedule.
To display the projects they have done
There is a large attendance, a unique attendance.
Stars of science
Some winners of the Project Fair projects
Who won one of the major prizes?
Which one is more innovative or creative, the forest or the reserve?
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and their vision for Qatar's future.
This is an idea for 2030.
How can a child contribute a creative idea to "2030"?
The main idea is that there is an electronic chip inside the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
Example: The referee can see the ball's movements.
Or that the playground is changing through this electronic slide.
What's fixed inside the ball.
In creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some people may ask.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, connected to something he enjoys, all of that is an achievement.
Offer support, we thank him for that.
Which is now in the development stage.
Similarly, the public, the committee, and some officials supported the projects.
First, no, it was the second, because this girl
Pipes, channels for underground attendance, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
A huge reserve forest
Where visitors can wander and watch animals and reptiles.
Similarly, sensors have been installed on some animals to examine their condition.
In addition to the marine environment, the entry method is also innovative.
One of the reasons for her success is also her broad and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
There's also one talking about a tourist city under the water.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
Many tourist ideas
Very interesting
Perhaps this is a need in their minds, at this time, or maybe in twenty or thirty years.
And in the future, this will be achieved.
Three projects.
It was adopted by the Science Club; they said these are the projects we need to work on.
In a project, he removed the unused air conditioners.
We read Al Arab newspaper.
The article says: "Qatar University celebrates the graduation of the new batch."
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Higher Education Council
Dr. Sheikha bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and the University of Calgary
Similarly, there are great news about our students.
An academic achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered one of the young actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
For how long, as well as colorful classifications and threads.
The actor Abdelhamid Charshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves.
If convincing,
He won't be chosen to be in the projects done within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Charshani is participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Classifications Part Two."
We're happy to have him as our guest this morning.
So that we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his experience in general.
Hello and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning Show. This is the first time I meet you and your first time on Doha Morning.
With the people who work hard for the program
And you, Ms. Lisa.
Welcome! Before we start our conversation,
Okay, let's see.
I am a responsible man and an executive director.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go ask them if anyone agrees that you don't have to return the bisht.
Of course, as a beginner, I have another question, but since we've seen this part of the series "Categories of Part One."
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marid.
A lot of things and information related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we'll watch this excellent report from our colleague Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's see it together.
Certainly, it is a testimony from people who know no flattery or favoritism.
As an affirmation of the history of this city or that.
As far as we see of his effects and hear of his tales and poets.
Classic and contemporary, hence it comes as an important record added to the city's register.
Al-Mureeza is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some believed it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the sacred valley of Tuwa.
Its founding date is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Mart is Mount Comet, which was the basis for many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical places.
This view is a tourist attraction in Saudi Arabia.
The municipality exerted tremendous efforts to complete this project.
A garden on this mountain
And seats for the locals and for all in the kingdom.
It was named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may God be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
And among her effects is the Valley of the Comets.
This is a place where the water from the reefs gathers and is preserved for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
Among her works is also the Heritage Guest House.
Marat is a city that dates back to pre-Islamic times.
He was famous for his inspired poets.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Comete.
Abdul Rahman's scene for the Doha Morning program,
Marat City, north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, you mentioned that our infrastructure is very unique.
We open a page for him and he registers through a special registration in our system.
Email his will.
This report covers the range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard gets a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's file.
Logs into his son's online account.
He sees his son's progress.
He can see his grades and interact with teachers.
So that we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
So that we can bring most of the children in the center and send them our warm regards.
I registered at this center with a teacher there.
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached since joining the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one task at a time, and after Ramadan.
But of course this is an effect that works at the expense of other works, always.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up watching TV, while people turn their worship towards the television.
Loosen, loosen, loosen the chain, loosen, let them do one job every two years, is that better?
Of course.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
But I would like to express my greetings to you all.
And God willing.
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was organized in Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And develop the children's abilities and skills more.
Unlike the various schools in this blessed country.
We have a model and we talked to our guest who was here before.
We now have with us Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. We welcome him and say good morning.
How are you, Ounissa?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Dr. Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Amanya is an example of that.
We will try with her the next technique or method that Ms. Nesma talked about.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
There can be a change in his mental abilities or even his educational level, there can be a change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child through an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the student's level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something like that will be conducted.
A wish will be prepared and answered live on air.
Of course, Amany knows nothing about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the first part of the Tsani series,
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky with several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with CEO Ashraf Shahata and Mr.
This is an opportunity from Tara for artistic production.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghonem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
In more than one episode, I'll be playing different characters.
On the contrary, this is a wonderful experience. In this job, we have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza, we have...
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Aqad.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Assam.
It happened a year ago, and last year we had two jobs a year.
This is probably why I asked you to be on the air. You've been acting since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition in acting.
Praise be to God for everything.
Acting properly or just pretending?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I took up acting as a talent, and the one who nurtured my talent initially was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me like a son.
If you need anything, call him.
We were in all of his shows.
We're tired, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, a special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
Compared to Kuwait, every year in Kuwait, twelve to sixteen new representatives come. Why?
They have it.
Of course, thank him very much for providing many opportunities.
But, let's say,
Let's talk about the second series, we had an idea about classifications.
We need to know about the killer feeling.
And also the foot.
We have an example, with us is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
Until this procedure is broadcast live.
And we can see how we can deal with the person. Let me first say good morning to Professor Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
May God bless you, and peace be upon you.
Alright, let's start with you, sir, please.
Inshallah.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
Like a painting or a message from God Almighty showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
You sometimes feel dizzy.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Let go of your hand, let it go. Calm your nerves, yeah.
By doing this, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
From the left side. His ears, he has a mild infection in his middle ear.
I'm in pain! What does this mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have an ear problem?
I have been small since the day I was born.
Do you still have pain here?
It's the frontal sinuses!
Do you have a pain in the nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
The thyroid gland is not very active, you feel lazy and lethargic all the time, and you feel your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel sluggish.
You always have an infection in your tonsils.
In. See the tremor, feel the tremor.
He suffers from stress and never walks barefoot, maybe for the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him!
Is this massage also beneficial for children?
The mother's thumb, thank God, is about the size of a child's palm.
Most children don't sleep, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think he loves to be carried. He has gases in his belly, bless you.
By the time the mother puts her thumb, she will stretch the thumb.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it so that every mother learns this move.
You're pressing like this, right and left, and right and left.
This is about the boy, about, about, about the boy and he is cute.
Okay, regarding discoveries, you have discoveries specific to women.
As we said, in every house, there are ninety percent women, God bless them.
First thing, first warning about ceramics and flat floors.
Walking barefoot on ceramic is acceptable, but walking on a flat surface can be dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when ceramic was used in homes, health problems increased.
Because it's cool and even.
When he was a child, he had problems, he suffered from asthma.
More.
A woman should be careful to focus on walking barefoot on the minefield.
This is the back of the foot and ankle region, the ankle.
From here, this is the foot and now under the comb.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate childbirth.
Focus with me a bit.
In the seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just once you're in the delivery month.
I mean, they don't come in eighth, eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is to walk barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful about walking barefoot.
If she's on time,
"And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will let fall fresh dates upon you."
We already know that Mary, we know that her strength comes from her.
I even discussed with scholars who told me: Why has Ibn Kathir's interpretation changed?
I told them: I give you the idea that God placed in this science, and He inspires me.
Shake the palm tree trunk towards you, when the tree shakes, what does the view look like?
It's sharp as nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, you command the wombs, and the wombs are in the center here.
They are the entrails. They give orders to facilitate childbirth and the reseating of the fetus.
Elevate the fetal head or reposition it until it comes out naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
Grasp the hand and begin to relax it.
Some take it as a habit, while others know it as a science.
Therefore, they are afraid to tell you, and you won't believe them.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I wanted to ask you one last question because time flew by.
If someone wants to get in touch with you, anyone who wants to get in touch with you, any specific email address or you.
Okay, the mobile number is with the control room. Anyone who wants to communicate with Professor Abdulaziz should call us after the program.
Of course on Qatar TV numbers, so that he can call us and take this number.
I was created solely to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like everyone else and do everything you can imagine. I'm an ordinary person.
But we look for the good more.
We always think of good.
Viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
We saw it live, how he discovered the diseases this human had.
And what he suffers. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read about him online.
The way it will be implemented in the coming days or years and whether it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The truth is that obesity in the Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So we were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth country with them.
This program frankly became the first lady of New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for that.
They offered it to us, and we accepted and said it's done.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can notice the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He gives up playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are today at the conclusion.
We are satisfied with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
Riqaya Girls' Independent School
And with high spirits.
The family became more aware, and their siblings at home were amazed and started eating this food like them.
A transitional culture emerged between the student and it transfers this culture to the home and to the family.
He goes and tells them, "They gave this to me" or "They taught me this."
The training staff or whoever provided this information to the students,
How did you select him and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, may God reward them well.
At our diet center, there are brothers who raise their awareness about food, healthy food of course.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they organize themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or raising awareness about the value of healthy nutrition.
It was in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or...
How are these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the male and female students.
This doesn't concern a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
How these students behave at first!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Is it sufficient to have three terms or specific terms in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, don't start on a large scale.
It starts from a reasonable range that includes all features; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Since it is not appropriate in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as their acceptance of certain things for their children and their non-acceptance of others.
They simply want to participate in it, and frankly, it's very important.
The 12- or 13-year-old student, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
This is the struggle of many people who want to become slender, but think it's impossible.
Some actors we see in the movies with thin bodies say this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And fruits rich in vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
A person should know the benefits of fruits, and must be aware that if they eat them, their health will improve, and thus their morale will be high.
As for the fruit, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruit.
So, that's a point.
It is diverse and certainly competitive; each school was creative with its different ideas for its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We give them guidelines and everyone must innovate.
Do you train the student teachers, or do you have your own staff?
I built them, I built them.
But the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would make Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and adopt it, Neck School said they will hold a march.
They said they were going to have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but they didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking on their own, the girls were better at it.
I would also like to thank Reyan Water for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Reyan Water for this.
Of course, water is much healthier because it needs to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter its body daily through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and not even know that it's the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, maybe they don't like team games.
Welcome to the live stream.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, is with us. Welcome.
While we naturally try to focus as much as possible on important topics.
We would like to introduce and inform our dear viewers about what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this name, too, might be unfamiliar to us,
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start to...
Kills us by striking the nerve cell.
Let me make it easier for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered with a layer called the lubricant, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, it usually leads to dizziness and double vision, diplopia.
It also led to digestive and respiratory problems.
In the worst cases, it leads to madness, quadriplegia, or paraplegia.
Of course, treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be severely affected.
Or from this disease, a condition called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories suggest that it is transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not infectious.
Children's rights matter.
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
For example, the equator has been spared from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to find the cause of the disease, so they can find a cure for it.
Currently, the process is now reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this disease, which we can describe as sudden.
Is there a particular group where you feel this disease is more prevalent?
Internationally, it was ranked between the top 20 and 40.
Currently, the international community for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started affecting young people up to the age of forty.
However, man does not recover from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, so through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about forming an association for this subject.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries are between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My number was sixty-four and six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
What we're certain of is that it's a virus, which is why we don't want to adopt a specific theory, that's one point.
The second point is how do I know if I have it or not?
This is very difficult.
I am confused, Professor Abdulaziz. I am trying to understand a specific point.
