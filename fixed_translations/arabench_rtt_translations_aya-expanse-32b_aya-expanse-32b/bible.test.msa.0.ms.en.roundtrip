Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me."
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me were to be led into sin? If that were to happen, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.

"If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with two hands or two feet."
"If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire." (Gospel of Matthew 18:9) The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my Father who is in heaven."
I
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that is straying?
What I am about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be more glad for it than for the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
Even so your Father who is in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you...
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But what if he doesn't listen to you? Go with another or two others. The book says, "Every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, "Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them."
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them." The unrelenting servant.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you not seven times, but seventy times."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
As the king was about to do so, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him, so she forgave him and set him free.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
The other servant fell on his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant and said to him, 'Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the stumbling servant as I have shown mercy to you?
In anger, his master delivered him to the jailers. He will be punished until he has paid back all his debts.
Thus shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him, and there he healed them.
The Pharisees came to test Jesus, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator from the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He answered, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).
They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.
So they asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a man a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
This is what I tell you: Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. It is not lawful for a man to divorce his wife except for unfaithfulness.
So the disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining celibate. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it.
"Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Others became that way at the hands of others. And there are those who made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this should do so." They brought little children to Jesus.
Many children came to Jesus, and the disciples tried to stop them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them, and then departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man approached Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what great thing must I do to obtain eternal life?"
Jesus answered, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, follow the commandments."
And he said, "Which ones?" Jesus answered, "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all those commandments, what should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful. For he had great possessions.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
And he agreed to give them the usual daily wage for workers. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
So he said to them, 'You also go into my vineyard, and I will give you what is right.'
So they went. "He went out again around twelve o'clock and three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into my vineyard and work."
In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received the usual daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual day's wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "These people who were recently hired only worked for one hour, yet you paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day."
The landowner replied to one of them, "Friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the people I recently hired the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Do you feel cheated because I gave generously to others?
"For many are called, but few chosen." Jesus speaks again of His coming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve aside and began to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews, and they will mock him, beat him, and crucify him. On the third day he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons: and she worshipped him, and desired a certain thing of him.
Then Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
Then Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten students heard about this. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever wants to be important among you should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd was following him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
He ordered them to stop. He told them to be quiet. But the two men cried out even louder, saying, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
They answered: "Sir, we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
And when they came near Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples.
And he said to them, "Go into the village that is before you. And immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say, "The Lord needs them. The master of the house will send them at once."
And all this happened so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled.
"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on them.
A great multitude spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed him, shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were buying and selling in the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
And he said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a den of robbers" (Jeremiah 7:11).
Blind people, lame people, and crippled people came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful works that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" And they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read in the Scriptures? 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowd and went away from the town to Bethany, and he spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. Therefore I say to you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." The authority of Jesus is challenged.
Jesus entered the temple courts and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued with each other about it. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of people"? We are afraid of people. Everyone believes that John was a prophet.
The two sons answered, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." - The Parable of the Two Sons
What do you think of this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
The son replied, "I won't do it," but then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"أيهما الابن الذي فعل مشيئة أبيه؟" قالوا: "الأول". فقال لهم يسوع: "الحق أقول لكم: إن العشارين والزواني يسبقونكم إلى ملكوت السماوات."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw this, but even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He built a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers, then traveled abroad.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, and commanded them to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then he sent other servants to the tenants, more than the first time. But they treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. "They will respect my son," he said.
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; let's kill him, and then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
"He will destroy those wicked men," they answered, "and will rent the vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23).
Here is what I say to you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be shattered to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized that he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowd, because they regarded Jesus as a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
So shall the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
So the king said to his servants, "The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy."
Go to the corners of the streets. Invite to dinner whoever you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said, "Friend, how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they could entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not care about anyone's opinion, and you do not show partiality.
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said to them, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. Bring him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"To Caesar," they answered. He said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed, and leaving him, they went away. For the wedding has not yet come.
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. It kept happening until he reached the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the living dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) "He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. Greatest commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
So he asked him, "Which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets must be fulfilled in these two commandments." So who is the Son of God?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He?" They said to Him, "The Son of David."
So he said to them, "Why then does David call him Lord?"
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool" (Psalm 110:1).
So if David called him "Lord," how could he be his son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions again.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The Pharisees and the Sadducees sit on the seat of Moses."
So you must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not prepared to move a single finger to lift them.
All that they do, they do it for people to see. They carry on their foreheads and arms small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make these boxes very wide. And they make the fringes of their coats very long.
They love to sit at the head of the table at feasts, and take the first seats in the synagogues.
They love to be greeted in the markets. And they love it when people call them "teacher."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You are not to be called teachers, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you is the one who serves you.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
I
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one to your faith, and when you have won him, you make him a son of hell twice as much as yourselves.
How much worse are you than the prophets! For you not only close off the kingdom of heaven, but you also prevent those who are entering from going in. You blind guides! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?
You are blind and stupid! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or the temple that worships gold?
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the food that is on it, he is bound.'
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And everyone who swears in the temple swears both by the temple and by the one who sits on the throne of it.
And whoever swears by the sky, he has sworn by the throne of Allah and by Him who is on it; it is indeed a truth and what is between them.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
O you blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
You hypocritical experts in the law and Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence. You clean the outside, but inside you are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
The same applies to you. From the outside, it seems like you're doing what's right. But on the inside, you're filled with what's wrong. You're pretending to be something you're not.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the graves of the righteous,
And you say, "If we had lived in the days of our predecessors, we would not have done what they did. We would not have been complicit in the killing of the prophets."
So you testify against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Complete, then, the sins that those who lived before you have begun!
O den of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to fire?
So I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. You will kill and crucify some of them, and whip others in your synagogues, and chase them from town to town.
"Then you will make atonement for the blood of every innocent person who has been murdered on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All this will happen to those who are living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Killer of prophets and stoner of those sent to you! How many times I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not let me!
Look, your house was left empty.
I say to you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord" (Psalm 118:26).
End marks
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking, his disciples came to him and wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said, "Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. And the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being led astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end is not yet.
One nation fights another nation, and one kingdom fights another kingdom. People starve. Earthquakes happen in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. Some will hate each other. And they will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise and mislead many.
For as evil increases, the coldness of most people's love will increase.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world, as a witness to all nations. And then shall the end come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day, you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should come back to get their coat.
What a harsh day for the pregnant and the nursing mother!
Pray you never have to flee in winter or on a Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than at any time since the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe them.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
Look, I told you before.
So if anyone tells you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out. Or if they say, 'He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures gather wherever there is a carcass.
"Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. They will gather together His chosen people from the four directions. They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's on the doorstep.
What I am about to tell you is true. People living at that time will certainly not die until all these things take place.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. The Day of Judgment and its hour are known only to Allah."
No one knows that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same in the day of the Son of Man.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field, one will be taken and the other left.
Six plowings with a hand plow, one is taken and the other is left.
So be on your guard; they do not know what day their Lord will come.
You must understand one thing. If the homeowner knew what time of night the thief would come, he would have stayed awake. He wouldn't have allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not think, the Son of Man is coming.
Let's suppose that a certain master puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The task of this servant is to give them their food at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this task.
It will be good for the servant if his master finds him doing his work when the master returns.
What I tell you is true. The master will make that servant ruler over all he possesses.
But what if that servant is wicked? What if he says to himself, "My master is taking a long time to return."
Let's assume he starts beating other servants. Let's assume he eats and drinks with those who overindulge.
The master of that servant will return on a day when the servant does not expect him. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where the hypocrites go. There people will wail and gnash their teeth.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five of them were wise.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
The wise men took oil in their flasks with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So, all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy for yourselves."
So the virgins went to buy oil. But while they were going, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.
Later, the other bridesmaids also came. "Sir! Sir!" they said, "Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I am telling you is true. I do not know you."
"Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man is coming." - The Parable of the Three Servants.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. He gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went and invested his money. He made an additional ten thousand dollars.
He who earned $4000 earned an additional $4000.
But the man who took the two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received ten thousand dollars brought the other ten thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with ten thousand dollars. Look, I've made an additional ten thousand dollars."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
The man who had received the four thousand dinars also came and said, "Sir, you gave me four thousand dinars, and here is another four thousand that I have made."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
Then the servant who had received the two thousand came and said, 'Master, you are a hard man. You reap where you did not sow and gather where you did not scatter seed.
So I was scared, I went out and put two thousand dollars on the ground. Look, this is yours.
His master answered, 'You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter?
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, you would have received it with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, "Take the two thousand dinars from him and give them to the one who has twenty thousand dinars."
To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do not have, even what they think they have will be taken away.
Throw this useless servant out. Out there in the dark, he'll wail and gnash his teeth. 'The sheep and the goats'
The Son of Man will come in his glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will separate the sheep from the goats, putting the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.”
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
And the righteous will answer Him, “Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?”
When did we see you a stranger and invite you into our homes? And when did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The King will reply, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels,
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not take me in. I was naked, and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? And when did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick or in prison and come to You?'
He will reply, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Anything you have not done for the least of these, you have not done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things, and then he said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, came together in the court of the high priest Caiaphas.
And they plotted to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But not during the feast, they said, "It might provoke people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with a very precious alabaster flask of ointment, and poured it on His head as He sat at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why waste such expensive perfume?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this, and said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
You will always have the poor with you, but I will not always have them.
I poured perfume over my body in preparation for my burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
And one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
And he said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you?" So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
Since then, Judas kept watching for the right opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That first day of the week the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go to the town to such-and-such a person and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house."' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them. They prepared the Passover.
And when it was evening, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me and hand me over to my enemies."
The disciples were very sad. They began to say to him, one after another: "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised." Woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born."
Judas was the one who would betray him. He said, "Is it I, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "All of you, drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I tell you: From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "You will deny me."
Then Jesus said to them, "This very night, all of you will fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Everyone might leave because of you. But I never will."
Jesus answered, "What I am about to tell you is true. It will happen this very night. Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I will die with you, but I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here until I go over there and pray."
So he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, John and James, and began to feel distress and anguish.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples, and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me one hour?"
"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away. And he prayed the third time, saying the same thing again.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.
"Rise! Let us go! Here is the one who hands me over to them!" - The Arrest of Jesus
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs accompanied him, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, knew them. He said, "The one I kiss is he. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how do prophecies come true then? They say it has to happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the multitudes, saying, "Am I a bandit armed against you?" he asked. "Was it necessary for you to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat every day in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus is taken to the council.
But those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
It was not far, so Peter followed Jesus. He went to the courtyard of the high priest. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin sought false testimony against Jesus to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
So the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer anything? What is it that these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, just as you say." "But I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy he has spoken."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said he wasn't. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gateway leading to the courtyard, and a servant girl saw him and said to the crowd, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't him. He swore, saying, "I don't know this man!"
A little later, those who stood there approached Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it crows, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
So they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse and was seized with a deep sense of guilt for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake, I released an innocent man." They replied, "So what? That's your problem."
So he threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money."
So they took counsel together and bought with them a field for a burial place, which was distant from the city, a suitable piece of ground on which no one had ever been laid.
That is why it is called "Garden of Blood" to this day.
So were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah, which he spoke, saying, "Thirty pieces of silver they gave for him, the price of him that was valued by the children of Israel."
"They used the money to buy the Potter's Field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) The presentation of Jesus to Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
Now Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, and he sent his wife to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which one do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify Him!"
"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers seized Jesus and brought him to the governor's headquarters, also called the Praetorium. Then the whole cohort gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
As they led him away, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
So they mixed wine with gall and offered it to him to drink. But when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them and cast lots for his garments.
They sat and kept watching him there.
And they put up over his head the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
And two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
The passersby shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
They said, "Are you the King of the Jews? If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He believes in God, so let God save him now if He wills, he who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard how Jesus cried out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
So one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
So the rest said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out with a loud voice again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
They came out of the tombs. And after the resurrection of Jesus, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
The centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, and they were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Not long ago, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve Him and meet His needs.
Mary Magdalene was there. So was Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
So Joseph went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean shroud.
And he laid it in a new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there in front of the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day of preparation, and the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Master, we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
Therefore give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, so that his disciples may not go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
Pilate answered, "Take a guard. Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath was over, and it was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
A violent earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
"Not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying."
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said. They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." So the guards went and reported to the chief priests.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
Tell the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'
If the governor hears this report, we'll make him pay. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders of Jesus to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. Yet some still had their doubts.
Then Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth,
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, saying: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
So John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. He said, "If you choose to accept God's way of thinking, then be baptized and God will forgive your sins."
All the people of the land of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and they confessed their sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist preached: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water; and, behold, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him.
A voice spoke to him from heaven, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for forty days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt him, but angels attended to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets and followed him immediately.
Then Jesus walked a little further ahead of them, and saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in a boat mending their nets.
So he called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went away to follow Jesus.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
So the people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
At that moment, a man in their midst, possessed by an evil spirit, cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it departed from him with a shout.
So all the people were amazed, and they were asking one another, saying, "What is this? A new teaching! With authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!"
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue and went at once, with James and John, to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That night after the sun had set, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and all who were demon-possessed.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him, "If you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be made clean!"
Immediately, the disease left him. He was healed.
Jesus sent him immediately. The man gave a strong warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town. He remained in secluded places, but people were coming to him from every quarter.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
After a few days, Jesus entered Capernaum again. And when the people heard that He was in the house, they gathered together.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no more room. Not even outside the door was there space. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not bring him near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus, and when they had dug out a hole, they lowered the mat the man was lying on.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
And there sat in the same place scribes of the Pharisees, who thought of his matter.
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?
Should I say to this one, "Your sins are forgiven you," or should I say, "Rise and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
He said, "I say to you, get up. Take your mat and go home."
So he got up, took his mat, and went out. And everyone was amazed, and they glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" - Jesus' choice of Levi
Jesus returned to the seashore of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd gathered to him, so he got into a boat and sat down, while the whole crowd stood on the shore.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. There were many tax collectors and "sinners" eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law among the Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance and to follow me." (Jesus asked about fasting)
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus from the Pharisees and said, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a patch of new cloth onto old clothes. If they did, the new piece would tear away from the old. That would make the tear worse.
"People do not put new wine in old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they put new wine in new wineskins." - Jesus is Lordâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâ
On one of the Sabbaths, Jesus was walking through the wheat fields with his disciples. And the disciples began to pluck some of the heads of wheat.
Then the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath according to the Law? Why do Your disciples do this?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
That was when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred showbread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.
So Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and withered hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about this? Is it right to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath? To save a life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "How hard it is for you to understand and believe! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
Then the Pharisees went out and held a council with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. And many multitudes followed Him.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard of all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and from Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would keep people from crowding him.
Jesus healed many people. That's why the sick were jostling to touch him.
As for those who do not believe, they are but words to them, confusing their hearts. They do not understand what they are
But Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up the mountain and called his disciples, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve of them, and called them apostles. And they were with him, and he sent them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus established the twelve and changed Simon's name to Peter.
There were Jacob son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name "Boanerges." Boanerges means "Sons of Thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. The crowd gathered again, and they were so numerous that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take charge. They said, "He's lost his mind."
And some scribes came down from Jerusalem, and said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the ruler of the demons he casts out demons!"
Then Jesus called them together and said, "If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
