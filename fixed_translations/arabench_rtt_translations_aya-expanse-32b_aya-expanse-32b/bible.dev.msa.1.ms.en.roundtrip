Joram begat Uzziah, and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz,
His son Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued through Jeconiah, the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel is the father of Abiud. Abiud is the father of Eliakim. Eliakim is the father of Ezra.
Ashur was the father of Shelemiah, and Shelemiah was the father of Jehu, and Jehu was the father of Azariah.
And Eleazar begat Phares, and Phares begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were ten generations from Adam to Noah, ten from Noah to Abraham, ten from Abraham to David, ten from David to the tribe of Judah, and ten from the tribe of Judah to Jesus Christ, who is called the Messiah.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her publicly. So, he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
You will bear a son. You must name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had said would come true, as he had announced through the prophet,
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
So they said to him, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star at its rising and have come to worship him.”
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, as was the whole population of Jerusalem.
Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearance.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I too may go and pay him homage."
And when the wise men had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another route. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
When the Magi had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him."
Joseph arose. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophets might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All boys two years old and under had to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah, which he spake:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, while he was still in Egypt.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother and left during the night for Egypt.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went to the lands of Galilee instead.
So he went and lived in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled: "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a road for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem, and from all Judea, and from all the region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit worthy of repentance for your sins.
Do not think that you will enter the kingdom of heaven by saying, 'We are descendants of Abraham.' I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness.
The axe is already lying at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, calling on you to repent. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
His pitchfork in hand to clear the hay from his barn. He gathers his wheat into the granary. But the chaff he burns in the inextinguishable fire." The Baptism of Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
So he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
So he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone'" (Psalm 91:11-12).
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you bow down to me and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled. He had said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. For those living in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets and followed him immediately.
Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And he called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains, some were possessed by demons, some were epileptics, and some were paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the humble, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me."
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. So they also persecuted the prophets who were before you. "You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world."
You are the salt of the earth. But what if the salt loses its saltiness? How can it become salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will trample it underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the smallest commandment. Do not teach others to break it either. For if you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep these commandments and teach them, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not murder' (Exodus 20:13). Whoever murders will be liable to judgment.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be handed over to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool,' will be subject to hellfire.
"If your gift is on the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you"
Leave your gift before the altar and go first be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
"If anyone has a claim against you, go to him quickly while you are still together and settle the matter, or he may drag you into court and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison."
What I'm about to tell you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Whore.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one eye than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go to hell, where the fire will never be put out. Mark 9:43"
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. Oath.
Once again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you swore to him."
But this I say to you: Make no such promises at all. Make them not in the name of heaven. For that is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of the Earth. It is the foothold of God's feet. Nor shall you make them in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
Do not take your oaths seriously, lest you incur sin and enmity. Is it not just a single strand of hair that you can make white or black?
Let "yes" mean "yes" and "no" mean "no." Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
If anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with him.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn away from those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' (Leviticus 19:18)
But I say to you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
So you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Even those who do not fear God do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father who is in heaven will not reward you.
"When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full."
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
When you pray, go into your rooms, close the doors, and pray to your Father who is in secret. He will reward you. For your Father sees in secret.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
Do not be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
"Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one."
Forgive people if they wrong you, for your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. Matthew 6:15
When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites who disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. For your Father sees what is done in secret. When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your face and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But make yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where neither thieves break in nor thieves steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. So, if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes were bad. Then your whole body would be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothing? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
"If God does not clothe the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
Therefore do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
"All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them."
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge, so that you may not be judged.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
You see a speck of sawdust in your friend's eye, but you do not notice the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend: "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," when there's a splinter in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.
To everyone who asks, it is given. He who seeks finds. The door is opened to him who knocks.
"If your son asks for bread, do you give him a stone?"
Or if he asked for a fish, would He give him a serpent?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and the small doors.
Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can know their true nature by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit. And a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
A tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!' Builders of wisdom and fools.
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. It falls with a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things, and the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught with authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain, and a large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to him and knelt down before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this; be made clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus answered and said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of the Roman centurion.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
So he said, "Sir, your servant is lying at home paralyzed, in great pain and unable to move."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I say to that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, as you have believed, so let it be done to you." And his servant was healed in that very hour.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
So Jesus took her by the hand, and the fever left her. And she rose and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who had demons were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He carried our sicknesses and our pains; yet we regarded him as punished, struck by God, and humiliated" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus requires sacrifice.
Seeing the crowds around him, Jesus instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then one of the scribes came to him and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Then another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves were overtaking the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
Then the disciples woke him up, saying, "Teacher, save us! We are perishing!"
He answered them, "How little faith you have! Why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus heals two demon-possessed men.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. He met two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs grazing.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Then Jesus said to them, "Go." And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. And the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned.
So the swineherds fled and spread the news in the town and in the countryside about everything that had happened, particularly about the men who had been possessed by demons.
So the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat and crossed over to the other side of the lake to his hometown.
Some men came, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes in their hearts said, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe, and they praised God, who had given such authority to human beings. (Gospel of Matthew 9:8)
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house with many tax collectors and sinners. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance and to follow me." Jesus was asked about fasting.
The disciples of John came to Jesus and said to him, "We the Pharisees fast often, why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
People do not patch a new piece of cloth on old clothes. The new piece will hang loose from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved. A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
So Jesus got up and went with him, and the disciples followed.
At that time a woman came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak. She had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, and no one had been able to heal her.
She thought: "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players and the mourning crowd.
He said, "Go, the girl is not dead, she is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
And when the multitude had been put out, Jesus went in, and took her by the hand, and the maiden arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he rubbed his eyes and said, "Why do they say, 'We are seeing'?"
Now they could see again. And Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
As they were coming out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.
When the demon had gone out, the man spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
"Therefore ask the master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest."
Jesus sent the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to join him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
The next two are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus and Judas Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go to the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a suitcase for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If that house welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is true. It will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before rulers and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you.
You will not be the speaker, but the spirit of your father will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to death. Fathers will deliver up their children. Children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me, but whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
When they attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not finish traversing the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say of his household?
"So do not fear them; indeed, We have accounted for everything in a clear book. (44) And not a leaf falls but that He knows it, and no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth or anything fresh or dry but that it is [written] in a clear record. (45)"
What I tell you in the darkness, shout abroad in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will.
He counts even every hair on your head!
So do not fear them; indeed, it is you, you who are the highest.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
A man's enemies are the men of his own house. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And assume that someone welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person. That person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who follow me, truly I tell you, will not lose their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he moved on to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered, "Go and tell John what you hear and see.
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. Those who have leprosy are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.
"What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
It is he who was written about in the book of Malachi: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one is greater than John the Baptist, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and violent people are seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is Elijah who was to come.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
"In what way am I like the people of today? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang you a funeral song, but you did not mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do, and people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” And also: “When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. For the Son of Man is go
Jesus began to denounce the cities where he had performed most of his miracles, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
As for you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for you. "Rest for all the weary"
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. That's what I wanted.
My Father has given everything to me. And the Father is the only one who knows the Son. Knowledge of the Father is only for the Son and for those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Become my disciples and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through the wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck the wheat and eat it.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! This work on the Sabbath is not lawful according to the law. But your disciples do it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"
So he entered the house of God, and ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for his men, but only for the priests.
Haven't you read the Law? It states how the priests in the temple are to conduct their work every Sabbath, yet they are not considered guilty.
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
The writing says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Starting from that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and weakened hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If your son or ox falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"
Man is more valuable than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
This is to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't extinguish a flickering flame. He'll make everything alright.
"Nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man who was blind and could not speak was brought to Jesus, possessed by demons. Jesus healed him, and the man was able to speak and see.
Everyone was amazed and asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil drives out the devil, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do those who are with you cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this: How can you enter a strong man's house and simply take what he has? You must bind him first. Then, you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
Here is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
"If the tree is good, its fruit is good; if the tree is bad, its fruit is bad. A tree is known by its fruit."
"You snakes in the grass! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts."
A good person says good things, and these things come from the good within them. A bad person says bad things, and these things come from the evil within them.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be condemned or acquitted." - "The Miracle Verse of Jonah"
Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered: "The disbelievers and corrupters ask you for a sign, but they will not be given anything like the sign of God's prophet Jonah."
Greece was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand in the judgment day with the peoples that are now living. And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now there is One here who is greater than Jonah.
"The queen of the south will rise at the judgment with this generation and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It goes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
He then says: "I will return to the house I left behind." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. It has been swept, cleaned, and tidied.
Then the unclean spirit goes out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is how it will also be with this wicked generation. (Matthew 12:43-45)
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
Everyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it, and all the people stood on the shore.
Then he proceeded to tell them many things, using parables. He said: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil, grew, and produced a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
His disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have too much. If no one has this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"The hearts of these people have become callous; their ears are unable to hear. They have closed their eyes, otherwise they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord for healing." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
"But those that fell on the rocky places are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy immediately."
But they have no roots, so they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when tribulation or persecution arises because of the message.
And others fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of daily life and the deceptive promise of wealth choke them. They prevent them from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop that is a hundred times, sixty times, or thirty times more than what was sown. "The Parable of the Weeds"
Jesus told the crowds another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The farm owner's servants came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did these weeds come from?"
He answered, "An enemy has done this." And the servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and weed them out?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat with the weeds.
"Let them both grow together until the harvest. And at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, 'Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'" Parables of the Weeds and the Grain of Wheat
Jesus told the crowds another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took it and planted it in his field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman took some yeast and mixed it into three measures of flour until all the dough was leavened."
Jesus spoke these things to the multitudes in parables. He didn't speak anything to them without a parable.
The words of the prophet came true, who said, "I open my mouth and speak, and I reveal hidden things from the foundation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the harmful tares.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weed in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seeds are the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes people to sin and all those who do evil.
They will cast them into the blazing fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let the hearer hear. The parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
When they were full, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
So he said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown of Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogues, and they were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and this power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Judah, and Simon?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were utterly displeased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
He did but a few miracles there because of their lack of faith.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his servant, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform miracles."
King Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her, for she is married."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. He was greatly pleased.
So he promised to give her everything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them. He healed their sick.
And it came to pass about evening, that his disciples came to him and said, The place is desert, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring them to me here."
Then Jesus commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the multitudes.
Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was about five thousand. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Then Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida. After he had dismissed the crowd, he took them along with him.
And when he had sent them away, he departed into the mountain to pray. And when even was come, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from the shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they cried. And they screamed in fear.
So Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
Then Peter said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." Jesus said, "Come."
And he said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and went to Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink, crying out, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and came to the region of the Gerasenes.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent messengers throughout the surrounding regions, and people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to let the sick just touch the fringe of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commandment of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
Therefore they have no need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect because of your tradition.
"You women protesters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There is a generation that does not belong to my Father in heaven. Uproot them completely.
"Leave them be. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth ends up in the stomach. Then it exits the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying about others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Master!" she said, "Help me!"
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, Lord. But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.
Jesus departed from there and walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up into the hills and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those who cannot speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
So the people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking, the lame were walking, the blind were seeing. And the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "What are these among so many?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground.
Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He answered, "In the evening you look at the sky and say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "There will be a storm today. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. "The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees"
The disciples crossed to the other side of the sea, and they forgot to bring bread.
Then Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about this among themselves and said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew their discussion, and said to them, "Why do you discuss among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not perceive and understand? Are your hearts hardened?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
"Do you not remember the seven loaves that were enough for four thousand men? Or how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?"
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "You are the Christ."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say I am?"
They answered, "Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Elijah. Still others say it is Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But he asked, "What about you? Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
So Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah, Jesus. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
"If anyone would save his life, he will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
What good is it to gain the whole world and lose one's soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will reward each according to his works.
What I am about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus was transformed.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. And a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one what you have seen." "Until the Son of Man has risen from the dead," he said to them.
So the disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to him and knelt before him.
"My lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shudders violently and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him."
"You brood of vipers! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?" Jesus answered. "Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. The boy was healed at that moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
He answered them, "Because your faith is so small. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They met together in Galilee. And Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were greatly distressed.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
He answered, "Yes, he does." When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? From their sons or from strangers?"
Peter replied, "From strangers." Jesus said to him, "Then the children do not need to pay."
But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find there the very coin you need. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and you.
