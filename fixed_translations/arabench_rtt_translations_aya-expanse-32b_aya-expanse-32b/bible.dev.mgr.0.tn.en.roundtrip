Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiakin and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
After this, the genealogy continues: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.

Elieud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
Thus there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the deportation to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon until the Messiah, whose name is Jesus, was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Youssef was a religious man, he didn't want to expose her in front of people, so he decided to divorce her in the best way possible.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had said would come true, as he had announced through the prophet.
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph was awakened. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his house as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. We have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, as was all the people of Jerusalem.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem of Judea," they replied, "for so it is written by the prophet."
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them exactly when the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, bring me word, so that I too may go and worship him."
After they had heard the king, the wise men went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. Jesus' family fled to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph's people. At night, he went to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah, which he had spoken,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of deep weeping and wailing. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
This is how Joseph resisted. Take the child and his mother Mary and return to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, who said: "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people were driven out of Jerusalem, and from all the land of Judah, and from all the districts around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
Do not think that you will enter the kingdom of heaven by saying, 'We are descendants of Abraham.' I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
The axe is placed at the roots of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water and call you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
"He who has the saw in his hand and is cutting, clears the straw from his threshing floor. He gathers his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he burns with unquenchable fire." (The Baptism of Jesus)
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. Jesus said to him, "You must be baptized by me. Why did you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so for now. It is right that we should fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God'" (Deuteronomy 8:3).
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' They will bear you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you bow down and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus was the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah fulfilled, who said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They who live in a land of deep darkness, on them will the light shine." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
At once, leave their window and follow them.
After that, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout all Syria. And people brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and those who were paralyzed. And he healed them all.
A large crowd followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region of the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up a mountain, sat down, and his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Blessed are those who have spiritual needs. The kingdom of heaven inspires.
Blessed are those who are sad, for God will bring them relief.
Blessed are those who have no pride. May God give them the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you because of me. Blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil against you falsely because of me.
Be joyful and cheerful, your reward in Heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Similarly, people don't put a light bulb under a bowl. They put it in its socket. That way, it lights up the whole house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. They will see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
"Do not even neglect the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to neglect them. If you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, go and do these commandments and teach them. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder.
"I have heard what was said to the people who lived a long time ago. They were told: 'Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be judged for it."
But this is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother 'Raka' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says 'You fool!' will be liable to hellfire.
Imagine that you are presenting your gift at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and present your gift.
"Imagine if someone has a claim against you and they take you to court. Try to settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still on your way with him. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison."
What I intend to tell you is true. You won't get out until you pay the last penny! Cheat
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'" (Exodus 20:14)
But that's not what we're telling you. Don't look at a woman the wrong way. Anyone who does that must have impure thoughts about her in their heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Divorce."
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.
Once again, I hear what was said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenants you make with the Lord. Keep the promises you have made to him."
But that's what I'm telling you. Never make such promises. Don't make them in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of Earth. This is the footprint of God. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And do not make your oaths a means to deceive others, lest a foot should slip after being firmly planted.
Just let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything more is from the devil. Be kind to others.
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'" (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
If someone wants to sue you to take your shirt, let them take your coat as well.
If someone confines you for a mile, walk two miles with him.
"Give to those who ask of you. Don't turn your back on those who ask to borrow from you. Love your enemies."
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'" (Leviticus 19:18)
But that's what I'm telling you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what reward do you expect? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your family, what more are you doing than the rest? Even people without religion do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing "righteous deeds" in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by people. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in the temples and on the streets, seeking the praise of others. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their full reward."
"When you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your reward will be with your Lord, and you will be rewarded for what you do secretly. Prayer.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble continuously as do those who do not fear God. They think they will be heard because they speak a lot.
Don't worry, your dad knows what you like even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. Matthew 6:15 (King James Version)
When you fast without eating, do not be gloomy like those who put on an appearance of piety. They darken their faces greatly. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their reward in full.
"But when you go out walking, don't eat anything, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face."
Others don't know that you are fasting. Only your father, who is unseen, knows. He will bring you your reward. Your father sees what is done in secret. Keep your wealth in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart is where your treasure is.
The eye is the lamp of the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.
But what if your eyes can't see? Your whole body becomes filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, then darkness becomes profound!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money at the same time. Do not be afraid.
We tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you wear. Isn't life more important than food? Aren't there things more essential for the body than clothes?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap crops. They do not store crops in barns. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"And why worry about clothes? Look how wildflowers grow. They don't work or make clothes."
But that is what I am telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
"If God so clothes the grass of the field, will He not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? For the grass is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven."
So do not worry. Do not say, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People without religion run after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
You judge people as they judge you, and you are measured by the same standards you use to measure others.
"You see a speck of sawdust in your friend's eye, but forget about the log in your own eye."
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get that splinter out of your eye," when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First, remove the log from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will open for him who knocks.
"You would have your child ask for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?"
Or suppose he asks for a fish, who among you will give him a live one?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small doors.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell, and there are many who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. Matthew 7:14 (ESV)
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
"You will know them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?"
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
The best tree bears the best fruit, and the evil tree bears evil fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
A tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Then we will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise and foolish builders.
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
It rains. Water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. And it falls with a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The people were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes of their own tradition.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. A large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The centurion believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
"Sir," he said, "my servant is lying at home unable to move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof, but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven, sitting with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they are from the kingdom, they will now be thrown out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! Let it be done as you have believed." And at that very moment his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
This is how he fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He carried our sins on his back, and our pains he carried. Yet we thought of him as someone punished, struck by God, and humiliated." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus requires sacrifice.
Seeing the large crowd that had gathered around him, Jesus instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then one of the scribes came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
A disciple said to him: "Master, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered them, "Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the wind and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He met two men possessed by demons. They were coming from the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come to torment us before our judgment?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
Those who served in the pig farm fled. They went to the countryside and told everything. They told the people about what happened to the men who were possessed by demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, sailed to the other side of the lake, and came to his hometown.
Then some of the Pharisees said to Jesus, "Teacher, this man is blaspheming." Jesus answered, "If I choose to forgive him, it is none of your business. All you need to do is believe."
Then some of the Pharisees said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man sat down and went to his house.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what it means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus was asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often; why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will stretch apart from the old one. This will increase the tear.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead donkey and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, "Your daughter is dead. Don't bother the teacher anymore." Jesus overheard this and said to the synagogue leader, "Don't be afraid; just believe."
Jesus rose and walked with him. His disciples did the same.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She was sick and had been bleeding for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought: "Just touching his clothes, and I will be healed."
Jesus turned around and saw her. "Woman, do not weep," he said to her. "Your faith has made you well." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the mourning crowd.
He said, "Go, the girl is not dead, she is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the audience was led out, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
When Jesus had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your belief will grant you sight."
Now they could see again. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the area.
As they were going out, another man who was possessed by a demon met them. He could not talk and was under the control of the demon.
When the demon had left, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." They were not able to say anything in response.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first two are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go to Gentile territories," he said. "Do not enter any Samaritan town.
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Healed the sick, raised the dead, cleansed those with leprosy, and cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
"Do not take with you any gold, silver, or copper in your belt."
Don't bring a bag for the trip. Don't bring extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. They will provide what is needed for the worker.
Upon entering a city or village, seek out someone willing to host you. Stay in that person's home until you depart.
When you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If this house welcomes you, grant it your blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If that's the case, shake the dust off your feet to leave this house or city.
What I intend to tell you is true. The Day of Judgment will be easier on Sodom and Gomorrah than on that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before rulers and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they catch you, don't worry about what to say or how to say it. At that moment, the right words to say will come to you.
Keep quiet when you speak, it's your father's soul speaking through you.
"Brothers will deliver up brothers to death. Fathers will deliver up sons. Children will rise against parents and kill them."
Everyone hates you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not finish traversing the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
A student doesn't surpass his teacher. A servant doesn't surpass his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say of his household?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be revealed. Everything that is secret will be made known.
What is whispered in the dark, proclaim in the light. What is murmured in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Two birds are being sold for a penny? But not a single bird will land on the ground without your father knowing.
Count even the hairs on your head!
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
"As for someone who says in front of people that he knows me? I too will say in front of God in heaven that I know him."
But how can one say in front of people that he doesn't know me? I say in front of God in the sky that I don't know Him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Let the sons be like their fathers. Let the daughters refuse to obey their mothers. And let the daughters-in-law be like their mothers-in-law.
A man's foes shall be they of his own household (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. If anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
If a person receives a prophet as a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if a person receives a righteous person as righteous, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my little ones. I tell you the truth, that person will certainly be rewarded."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus was teaching his twelve disciples. Afterward, he began teaching and preaching in various places in Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about the works of Christ, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered: "Go back to John and tell him what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not lose their faith because of me.
When John's disciples had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If so, what did you see? A man dressed nicely? No. People who dress nicely are in the palaces of kings.
What did you go to see? A prophet? Ah, I tell you, more than a prophet.
It is written about him in the Holy Book. It says: "Behold, I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one was more important than John the Baptist. But the least important person in the Kingdom of Heaven is more important than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
"What should we compare people today to? Like children sitting in the market, voting on people. They say,"
We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance. We sang you a song of consolation, but you didn't grieve.
When John came, his eating and drinking were just like yours. And people said, "He has a devil."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you do. And they said, "This man eats and drinks too much, and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions. Cities that are not turned away from sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. The people of those cities did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hell. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
But I tell you this: It will be easier for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. "Rest for all the weary."
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Here it is, Dad. This is what you want.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. Those who know the father are the son and those chosen by the son to introduce them to him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Be my followers and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
"My service is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath day, Jesus walked through fields of wheat. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick the heads of wheat and eat them.
The Pharisees saw him. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath, according to the law. But your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, he and his men, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for his men, but only for the priests.
Haven't you read the law? The priests in the temple are required to perform their service every Sabbath, but they are not considered guilty.
I'll tell you about someone more important than the temple that's here.
The writing says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
After they had left that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and twisted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They said, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! That is why the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just as new, like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to underestimate him.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. He says:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen. He is the one I love, in whom I delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
No one hears him arguing or shouting in the streets.
What doesn't break a curved stick, doesn't extinguish a low flame, is going to fix everything.
"The peoples will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus met a man possessed by demons. The man was blind and mute. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man could speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and they said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that we cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Have you ever thought about this? How can you enter a strong man's house and simply take what he has? You must tie him up first. After that, you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
This is what I am telling you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
If a tree does good, its fruit is good. If a tree does evil, its fruit is evil. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the good that is hidden within him. And an evil man speaks evil words. This comes from the evil that is hidden within him.
But that is what I am telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every careless word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified or condemned." St. Augustine
Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied: "The evil and disbelieving people ask for a miraculous sign! But no sign will be given except the sign of Prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights. Something like that is going to happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
"The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation. The Ninevites repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here."
"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn them. She came from a far country to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a human? It passes through dry lands searching for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been swept, cleaned, and tidied.
Then the unclean spirit goes out of the man, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation." - Jesus and his brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told me, "Your mother and siblings are outside, they need to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
Everyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds.
Sow the seeds in the ground. Some fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Another seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered and said, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, he will have too much. If no one has this kind of knowledge, even the little he has will be taken from him.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
"The hearts of this people have grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they cannot endure for long. They quickly fall away from the faith when troubles or suffering come because of the message.
Some seeds fell among thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke the word out of them and prevent them from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. "The Parable of the Weeds"
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The servants of the owner of the farm came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where did the weeds come from?"
"It is the work of an enemy," he answered. And the servants asked him, "Shall we go and pluck them up?"
"No," answered the landowner. "And while you're harvesting the saffron, you might as well take the wheat with it."
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." Parables of mustard and leaven
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took it and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it becomes the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. And the birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus told the people all these things by using parables. He didn't tell them anything without a parable.
So the words of the prophet were fulfilled, which he spoke: "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things kept since the foundation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will uproot everything that causes sin from His kingdom, and they will also save those who do evil.
"He will cast them into the blazing fire of Hell. There they will weep and gnash their teeth."
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. My story is about the hidden treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it. He was very joyful. So he went and sold all that he had and bought that field."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
"He found one very precious pearl. So he went and sold all that he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be cast into the burning furnace. There they will wail and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.
Jesus spoke these parables in the early morning while still dark. Then he left the area.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogues. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where does he have the power to do miracles?"
Is this the carpenter's son? And isn't his mother's name Mary? And aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Why aren't all his sisters with us? Where did the man get all those things?
They didn't like it at all. But Issa told them, "A prophet is not honored in his own country. He does not receive any honor in his own home."
"Little could be done there, because they had no faith."
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform miracles."
King Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John said to Herod, "It is against the law for you to take her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was greatly pleased.
So he promised her by an oath that he would give her what she asked.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very disturbed. But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
He brought her his head on a large tray and gave it to her, and she carried it and took it to her mother's house.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds the five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he got into a boat and went to a secluded place. The crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them. He healed their sick.
When it was getting late, the disciples came to him and said, "There are only five loaves of bread and two fish here. What good is that for a crowd like this?" It was
Jesus answered: "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves and two fish," they answered.
He said: "Bring them to me here."
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was almost 5000. Even the women and children ate. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat. He told them to go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida. Then he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was far from the shore. Waves were crashing against it due to the wind blowing.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they cried, and screamed in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid!"
"Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then everyone in the boat bowed down to Jesus and said, "You are truly the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding areas. The people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They begged him to allow the sick to touch only the tassel of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
Who makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
"Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect by your tradition.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:"
"These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
It is not what goes into your mouth that makes you "unclean"; it is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
Then the disciples came and asked, "Do you know what the Pharisees were saying when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand it yet?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it exits the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. They are the things that make you "dirty."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other immoral acts. Also theft, bearing false witness, and slandering others.
These are the things that make you "unclean". But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "A woman of Canaanite faith"
Jesus departed from Galilee and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus spoke a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded, "Master, he is still weeping."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell at his feet, kneeling. "Master!" she said, "Help me!"
He replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, my Lord," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the mute, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak spoke. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk walked. The blind saw. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed so large a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
The lion took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children ate a lot.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He went aboard the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a wondrous sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening, you see the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! And no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Pupils crossed to the other side of the lake, forgetting to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves and said, "He must mean this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "You of little faith! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full we gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets were collected?
How is it that you don't understand? I didn't talk to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not speaking of the wine used in the bread, but was warning them against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went on to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what does it matter to you?" he asked. "Who do you think I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he will suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He will be killed, and on the third day he will be raised from the dead.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
If he seems to love to destroy himself, he will lose himself. But if he loses himself for me, he will find himself.
"What good is it to gain the whole world and lose one's soul? Or what would one give in exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will reward each according to his works.
"What I am about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
"The transformation of Jesus"
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James. He brought them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There, before them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell to the ground with their faces down.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they raised their heads, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one what you have seen." He said to them, "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, when the Son of Man comes, they will not recognize him. They will do to him whatever they want to do. That is how they will treat the Son of Man.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him.
"Sir," he said, "have mercy on my son. He trembles violently and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your children, but they couldn't find a cure for him.
"Oh people, you are a generation that does not believe, and your hearts are hardened!" Jesus replied. "How much longer shall I remain with you? How much longer shall I bear with you? Bring the child to me here."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. The boy was healed at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
I
They went to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Ah, he does it this way," you replied. When Peter entered the house, Jesus was the first to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties from? Do they collect them from their own children or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the sons do not have to pay," Jesus told him.
"But I don't want to annoy them. Why don't you go to the lake and cast your net? Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. Inside, you'll find the coin you need exactly. Take it and give it to them on my behalf and yours."
