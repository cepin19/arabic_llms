Jesus called a little child to him and had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

"Whoever welcomes one such little child in my name, welcomes me."
"But what if one of these little ones who believe in me is led astray? If anyone causes one of these little ones to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."

"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire in hell with two hands and two feet."
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
"Take care not to despise any of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
I
What do you think? Imagine a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep in the mountains and go look for the lost one?
What I intend to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be more pleased with it than with the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
Even your father in heaven doesn't want any of these little children to be lost. If anyone wrongs you
"If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him how he has wronged you. Keep the matter between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back."
"But what if he doesn't listen to you? In that case, take one or two others with you. The book says: 'Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' (Deuteronomy 19:15)"
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, this is what we tell you. Imagine two of you on earth agreeing on anything they ask for, God in heaven will give it to you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." - The Merciless Servant
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
As the king was about to do so, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man couldn't pay, so his master ordered him, his wife, his children, and all his possessions to be sold to pay off his debts.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
A kind lady took pity on him, forgave him for what he had done and set him free.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
"The other servant fell on his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I will repay you the money.'"
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The servants saw what happened to the rest. They were extremely disturbed. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the lord called the first servant inside. He said to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave all that you owed me because you pleaded with me.
Why didn't the other servant show you the same mercy I showed you?
In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
So shall My Father who is in heaven do also unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him. He healed them there.
Then the Pharisees came and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are not two, but one. Therefore, man should not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Then why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts, but it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who find help to live without marrying can accept it."
Some men cannot bear children because they were born that way. Others became that way because of others. Still others made themselves that way to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way, does so. "Bring the little children to Jesus."
Some people brought their children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good but one. If you want to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which one?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have obeyed all these commandments," the young man said. "What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will we have?"
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When all things are renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those of you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Whoever leaves home or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "And you too, come help me in my vineyard, and I will pay you fairly."
And so they went. He went out again around noon, three hours later, and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he left and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one hired us," they replied. She told them, "You go and work in my vineyards too."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the foreman. He said, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Start with the last ones hired, and then go to the first."
The workers who were hired arrived around five o'clock. Each of them received the regular daily wage.
Furthermore, when the first who had agreed came, they expected to take more. But each of them also took the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about its owner.
"Those people who just got hired only worked for an hour," they said. "We paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and stood under the scorching sun all day."
The employer replied to them alone: "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the regular daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I'd like to give those who came after you the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel betrayed because I gave so generously to others?
"Those who attain the lower rank are the first, and the first are those who attain the lower rank." Jesus speaks again of his impending death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. And on the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "There the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they hand him over to non-Jews. People mock him and flog him. They crucify him. On the third day, he rises from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children, with her sons, and, kneeling down, worshipped him, and desired a certain thing of him.
"Who am I?" asked Jesus. She said to him, "You promised me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and that the other will sit at your left."
"You don't know what you're asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The rest of the ten pupils heard about this. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever among you wants to be great should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like the son of Adam. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They begged them to be quiet. But the two men shouted all the louder, "Master! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood still and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?" He asked them.
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt by it. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says something to you, tell them that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
Say to the city of Zion, "Behold, your king comes to you. He is humble and rides on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus had told them.
They brought the donkey and the chick. They put their blanket. Then Issa sat on the blanket.
Large crowds spread carpets on the roads. Others cut tree branches and spread them on the roads.
Some people walked ahead of him, and others followed him. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you make it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
People who were blind and disabled came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and even the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you read," they retorted, "'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and came to the outskirts of the city, to Bethany, and spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed and said, "How did the figs dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for when you pray." Jesus' authority is questionable.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I also will ask you one question. If I tell you, you will by no means let me go away until I have answered it for you."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'of men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Parable of the Two Sons.
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'"
"I'm not going to do it," the boy replied. But then he changed his mind and went ahead.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the way of salvation, but you did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw this, but even at that moment, you did not repent of your sins and did not believe. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another parable. There was a man who owned a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He built a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers, then traveled abroad.
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the produce.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. And they killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other workers to the tenants. He sent more than the first time. The tenants treated these the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. "They will respect my son," he said.
But the tenants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit the landowner's entire estate one day. Come, let's kill him. Then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do with these tenants?
"The destroyer of people destroys the wicked," they answered. "Then he grants his bounty to other vinedressers. They give him his share of the harvest at vintage time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
This is what I am telling you. The kingdom of God is taken away from you and given to people who will bear fruit.
Anyone who falls on that rock will be broken into pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on.
The scribes and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew that he was speaking against them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them another parable. He said,
Here is how the kingdom of heaven is like. A king gave a wedding feast for his son.
She sold her servant to those who invited her to dinner. The servant told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent some of the servants again, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fatted calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention; one went to his field, and another to his business.
The rest captured his servants. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king departed in great anger. He sent his army to destroy them. Those murderers killed and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servant, "The wedding dinner is ready. But those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they found, both good and bad. Soon the banquet hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding attire.
'Friend', he asked, 'How did you get in here without your wedding dress?' The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servant, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There people will mourn and gnash their teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made a plan to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, no matter how important they are.
Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Warily, people used a currency to pay their taxes. They gave him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. "Marriage is when the dead rise."
On the same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his brother's name.
We were seven brothers. The eldest got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, whose wife will you be? All seven were married to you.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures, and you do not know the power of God.
When the dead rise, they do not marry. Their parents do not give them in marriage. They will be like angels in Paradise.
"Can the dead judge? Haven't you read what the Lord has said?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. It was a command that took first place.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Professor," he asked, "Which is the most important commandment of the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the law and the prophets is based on these two commandments." Who is the son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"Who do you think is the Messiah? Who is his father?" "Son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'my Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "my lord," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
So you must obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not prepared to move a finger to stir them.
All that they do is done to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes on their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at dinners. They also love to have the most important seats in the temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. And they love it when people call them "Rabbi."
"But you shouldn't call yourselves 'Lord'. You have one Master and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You shouldn't call yourself "teacher." You have one teacher, and it is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever raises their hand is lowered, and whoever is lowered is raised.
"How will you escape the condemnation of hell, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock the doors of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to go in."
I
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around the sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing; but whoever swears by the gold that is in the temple is bound by his oath.'
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Gold? Or the temple that worships gold?
It also says: "If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift which is on it, he is bound by it."
Oh blind men! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
"So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it."
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by the temple and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, he has sworn by the throne of Allah and by Him who is on it; it is indeed a truth and what is between them.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
O blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
This applies to you as well. From the outside, you appear to be doing what is right. But on the inside, you are filled with what is wrong. You pretend to be something you are not.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the graves of the righteous.
And they say, "If we had lived in the times of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets."
So you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the measure of sin of those who lived before you!
"O nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to fire?"
So I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. You will kill some of them, and you will crucify others, and you will flog others in your synagogues, and you will chase them from town to town.
"Therefore you shall pay for every drop of righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I am about to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are living now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is empty.
"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple. He was walking away when his disciples approached him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. And the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being led astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end is not yet.
A nation will fight a nation. A kingdom will fight a kingdom. People will suffer from hunger. Earthquakes will occur in several places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and all nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many will abandon their faith. They will hate one another and hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For as evil increases, the love of most people will grow cold.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, to all nations, and then the end will come.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) on the day you see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this."
Then those in Judea will flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go inside the house to get something.
No one in the field needs to go back and get their coat.
How those days are for the pregnant woman! How they are for the nursing woman!
I pray to my Lord that we don't have any escapes in the winter or on Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe them.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you "It's far in the desert," don't go. Or if someone says "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
"The lightning that flashes in the east is seen in the west. So will it be on the day when the Son of Man appears."
Crows gather wherever there is a corpse.
"After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. They will gather together His elect from the four corners of the earth, from one end of heaven to the other.
Take heed of the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
What I'm about to tell you is true. People who lived in that time didn't necessarily die until all those things happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour.
No one knows about that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women grinding at the mill, one is taken and the other left.
"So trust in God; indeed, you are on the clear truth. So let those who defy His command beware..."
You need to understand something. Imagine if the homeowner knew where the thief was coming from at night. He would have been on guard. He wouldn't have allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not think, the Son of Man is coming.
Imagine a master who puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The task of this servant is to distribute food to them at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this task.
It is better for the servant if they find their master working in their business and not returning.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Mr. will make that servant responsible for all that he possesses.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is a long time in coming."
Suppose he starts beating the other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then the Lord will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where the rebels go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
Behold, how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The fools took their lamps, but they did not take oil with them.
The wise men brought oil in flasks with their lamps.
The bride hasn't come for a long time. So all the guests got tired and left.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted: "Here comes the groom! Go out to greet him!"
Then all the bridesmaids woke up and prepared their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
That's how they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the groom arrived. The relatives who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. After that, the door was closed.
Later, the rest of the bridesmaids came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "The story I'm going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
"Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming." - The Parable of the Three Servants
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could take care of. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and started investing his money. He made another $10,000.
He who won 4000 dinars won another 4000 dinars.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of the servants, the destroyer, returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought another $10,000. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
The woman answered and said to him, "You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
The man to whom you gave 4000 dinars came and said, "Sir, your trust in me allowed me to earn another 4000 dinars. Look, here are the 4000 dinars I made."
The woman answered and said to him, "You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
Then the man who had received the twenty thousand dinars came and said, "Master, I know that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
So I was afraid, and I went out and hid your two thousand dollars in the ground. Look, here is what is yours.
The man replied, "Servant of evil and idleness! Do you know that I am reaping where I did not sow? Do you know that I am gathering crops where I did not scatter seeds?"
Alright, you should've deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would've collected it with interest.
Then his master called the other servants and said, "Take the thousand dinars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand dinars."
To those who have, more will be given. They will have more than enough. And what about those who have not? Even what they have will be taken from them.
Throw that useless servant out. Out there in the dark, people will whimper and gnash their teeth. 'The sheep and the goats'
The Son of Man will come in his great glory, accompanied by all the angels. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before him. People will be separated into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will separate the sheep from the goats, putting the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
I was lacking clothes. And you gave me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord," they will say, "when did we see you hungry and feed you? And when did we see you thirsty and give you a drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? When did we see you lacking clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The king will reply: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done for the least of these my brothers, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give to me. I was sick and in prison. But you did not help me.
They also asked, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?"
He will reply, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have not done for one of the least of these, you have not done for me."
"Then they will walk far away to be punished forever. But those who did the right thing will have eternal life."
The plot to kill Jesus
After he had said all this, he then said to the disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They devised a plan to capture Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an expensive jar of perfume, broke it open, and poured the perfume over his head as he was eating.
When the students saw that, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
"The perfume could be sold at a high price. The money could be given to the poor."
Jesus knew this, and said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good deed for me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
The first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread came, and the disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says: 'My time is near. Let us celebrate Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
Jesus' disciples were very sad. One by one, they started to say to him, "It's not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
"The son of man goes as it is written of him. But woe to him by whom the son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "It isn't me, Teacher, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "All of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7)."
But after we rise from the dead, we will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone else might leave because of you. But I will never leave."
"What I'm telling you is true," Jesus replied. "It will happen tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I will die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell on his knees on the ground. He prayed and said, "Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Look at what I've come to. That's how you don't fall into sin when temptation comes. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Again, Jesus went away and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. A third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! Here is the one who betrays me!" The arrest of Jesus.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs accompanied him, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. "The one I kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "For all who draw the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask God for help? He can send me an army of over 70,000 angels in an instant.
But how are the sacred texts verified then? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowds. "Am I leading an armed gang against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat every day in the temple courtyard teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus brought him to Caiaphas, the high priest. There the teachers and elders gathered.
It was not far, he followed Peter and Jesus. He went as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, despite many false witnesses. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said: "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered. "As you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You yourselves have heard his evil words."
"What's your opinion?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They hit him with their hands. They also slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said he didn't know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus the Galilean," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I don't know why you are talking," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't him. He swore, saying, "I don't know this man!"
After a short while, those who were standing there approached Peter and said to him, "Surely you are one of them," "Your manner of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt ashamed and deeply regretted his actions. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I released an innocent man." "What does it matter to us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Then Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. He went away and hanged himself.
They met the priests and said, "Putting this money in the temple's box is against the law. It's ill-gotten gains. It's paying for human lives."
So they decided to use the money to buy land for burial. People from other countries would be buried there.
That's why it's still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then were fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
"They used the thirty pieces of silver to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do you not hear the accusations they are making against you?"
But Jesus made no reply to any of the charges. The governor was amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the people were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was why they handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, "Have nothing to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which one do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall we do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and with a sudden flare-up of anger he went back into the palace. "This man is not guilty," he said to them. "I will have him flogged and then release him." But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Then he took Jesus outside and handed him over to them to be crucified.
All the people answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus scourged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they took branches of thorn and made a crown, which they put on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They returned his clothing to him. After that, they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified.
As they led him out of the city, they came upon a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with bitter herbs and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there with their guards.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and build it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
How is it that the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him?
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He believes in God. May God save him now if He wills it. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also reviled him. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole earth was covered with darkness.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those standing there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
At once one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said: "Leave him alone, let's see if Elias comes to his aid."
After Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
Tombs were opened. Many bodies of saints who had fallen asleep were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that happened. They were very afraid. They said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Going on from there, he saw many women, who were mourning and wailing. They followed Jesus from Galilee and were providing for him.
Mary Magdalene was there. So was Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebed's children. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
Talut walked to him and asked for the body of Isa. Talut commanded that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
She placed it in his new tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. She put a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then she left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Day of Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something the liar said while he was alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So give the order to secure the tomb until the third day. If you don't, his disciples may come and steal the body, and then tell the people that Jesus has risen from the dead. That last lie would be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a guard to watch over it.
The resurrection of Jesus from the dead.
The Sabbath was over, and dawn on the first day of the week had just broken. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
There was a powerful earthquake. The angel of the Lord descended from heaven. The angel walked to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shines like lightning. His clothes are white like snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they started trembling as if they were dead.
The angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Come on! As he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is my message for you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Peace be with you!" he said. They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers: "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'
If the governor hears this report, we'll bribe him. That will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. The Jews have been spreading this story ever since. The last orders to Jesus were given to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated before him. However, some people still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be assured that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins, and then God would forgive them.
A crowd came out to him from all the region around the Jordan, confessing their sins, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John preached: "One who is stronger than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water, and immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said to him, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. A devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they imprisoned John, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
At once, leave their window and follow them.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them. And they left their father Zeinab in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, not as their scribes.
At that moment, a man in their synagogue shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
"Who are you to rule over us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? We know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a shout.
All the people were amazed. They said to each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! And he commands even the evil spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately, they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had left her. Then she started serving them.
That evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick or possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were afflicted with various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. There, He prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
"And a great multitude followed him, and he healed there many that had divers diseases; and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. And there came a certain woman, having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any:"
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and humbly asked him. He said, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean!"
The disease left him immediately. He recovered.
Jesus immediately rebuked him. He sternly warned the man.
"Do not tell this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a proof for the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and started talking incessantly. He spread the news to everyone. So Isa could no longer enter the city publicly. He remained outside in desolate places. But people continued to come to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the mat, they let down the man.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
There were some Islamic scholars. They were thinking,
"Why does this boy speak like that? He utters evil words! Only God forgives sins!"
From dawn, Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking like that?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said, "Come on, get up. Take your things and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus calls Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowds that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law among the Pharisees who saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. They said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (Jesus asked about fasting)
John's disciples and the Pharisees fast. People came to Jesus and said, "John's disciples fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast. But your disciples do not fast. Why?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they did, the new piece would pull away from the old one. This would increase the tear.
People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be lost. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through a wheat field with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck and eat the heads of grain.
They said to Jesus, "Look! Doing that on the Sabbath is against the law. Why do your disciples do such a thing?"
He replied, "Haven't you read what David did? He and his companions were hungry. They needed food.
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the hallowed bread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave some to his men also.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Once again, Jesus entered the temple. There was a man with a withered and twisted hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered and crooked hand, saying to him, "Rise and stand in the midst."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Do we do good or evil? Do we save life or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around in anger and was deeply disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. The multitudes were following Jesus.
Jesus walked to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed them.
The people heard of all that Jesus was doing. Many came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, and the surrounding regions, as well as from Tyre and Sidon and the areas around the Sea of Galilee.
Due to the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This way, people would not crowd around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick were pressing forward to touch him.
When the people with evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority. He gave Simon the name Peter.
There were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus. And there were Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them. He was the one who handed Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul.
Jesus entered a house. Another crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. So they went to take care of him. They said, "He is crazy."
Some of the Pharisees who had come from Jerusalem said, "He is driven by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he drives out demons."
Then Jesus called the people to him and said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
