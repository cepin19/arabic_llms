The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David the son of Abraham:
Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot Jacob. And Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.
Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez fathered Hezron. Hezron fathered Aram.
And Aram begat Aminadab. And Aminadab begat Nahshon. And Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse.
And David became the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
And Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ahaziah.
And Uzziah begot Jotham. And Jotham begot Ahaz. And Ahaz begot Hezekiah.
Hezekiah begat Manasseh. And Manasseh begat Amon. And Amon begat Josiah.
Jehoiakim, his brothers, and the people of Judah were exiles in Babylon.
After the period of their exile in Babylon had passed, Jechonia brought Shealtiel. And Shealtiel brought Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud. Abihud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
And Azur begat Sadoc. And Sadoc begat Achim. And Achim begat Eliud.
And Judah begat Pharez, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram.
James was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah.
And there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the carrying away into Babylon, and fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: (Luke 2:1-7)
And this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: At that time, Mary, His mother, was engaged to a man named Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
He decided, may God bless him, to distance himself from her without exposing her, for he was a man who feared God.
He is still pondering the story, an angel appeared to him in a dream, and said: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is with child by the Holy Spirit,"
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
And all of this happened so that the words that the Lord spoke through the prophet could be fulfilled:
# Isaiah 7:14 The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. (which means "God with us")
When Yusuf woke up, he did as the angel had instructed him from his Lord, and he went to his family's home.
And he did not know her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.
The Seven Sages
At that time, Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, during the reign of King Herod. Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem.
They said: "Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
And when King Herod heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And the chief priests and the scribes asked him, saying, "Where is the Christ to be born?"
Answer them: "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote in the book:"
# Micah 5:2 "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
And Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the time the star had appeared.
And being sent, they came to Bethlehem. They said, "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you have found him, bring me word, that I may also go and worship him."
After hearing the king's words, they set out. And behold, the star they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
They were overjoyed when they saw the star.
And they entered the house and found the child with his mother Mary. And they fell down and worshipped him. And they opened their treasures and presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
And their Lord warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they took another route and went to their own country. The flight to Egypt
After consulting the wise men, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
My brother, Joseph got up, shook the child and his mother at night and walked to Egypt.
# He is 11:1; Jer 4:22 And he lived there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My son." Then Herod sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem
And when Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi.
Behold, the thing which the prophet Jeremiah said has come to pass.
# Jeremiah 31:15 "In Ramah, they heard a cry, a bitter weeping and mourning. Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." The return from Egypt to Nazareth
When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
And they said: "People! Shake the child and his mother and return to the land of Israel, for the love they bear him, they died."
My brother got up, shook the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
When he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
And he went to a city called Nazareth and dwelt there, to fulfill what was spoken by the prophets: "He shall be called a Nazarene."
The Proclamation of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
In those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of the region of Judea.
He says: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!"
# Isaiah 40:3 And John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching, saying, "Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight!"
John wore a garment of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
The people were walking from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the region around the Jordan.
They shall confess their sins and be baptized in the Jordan River.
And when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Do what you want, you're adults now.
What are you saying in your hearts: "We are the children of Abraham." I am telling you, God is able to make from these stones children for Abraham.
The fig tree is tied to the veins of the tree; the tree that does not bear abundant fruit is pruned and thrown into the fire.
John the Baptist said, "I baptize you with water, but one who is more powerful than I is coming, I am not worthy to untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
And he shakes the palm branch in his hand and scatters the sheaves in the hall, gathers the wheat in the granary, but the straw, they burn with a fire that does not go out." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Jesus went from the region of Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
John said to him, "How can you come to me if you don't let me baptize you?"
And Jesus answered him, “Let it be so to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented.
And when Jesus was baptized, he went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
And Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
Oh brother, he fasted for forty days and forty nights until he became famished.
And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
# Not 8:3 Jesus answered: "The Scripture says: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
They came to the Holy City with a whirlwind, and stood on the roof terrace of the Temple's belongings.
# Matthew 9:11-12 They said, "You are the Son of God, throw Your spirit down, for it is written in the Holy Book: 'He will command His angels concerning you, and they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
# Matthew 6:16 Jesus answered, "It is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
Increased Hazo Blys and placed on a high mountain, and behind him were all the kingdoms of the world and the glory therein,
They said: "We will give you this thing, the cloak, if you kneel down and prostrate before us."
# Mark 6:13; 8:33 Jesus replied, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
And he cast out the spirit with a word, and the demon came out. Then the angels came and began to serve him. Jesus preaches in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
And when Jesus heard that John had been handed over, He withdrew to Galilee.
He left Nazareth and went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,
"As it is written in the prophecy of Isaiah the prophet"
# Isaiah 9:1-2 Land of Naphtali, land of Zebulun, by the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles!
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region of the shadow of death light has dawned.
And from that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus calls the first disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11)
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw Simon who they call Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
He said to them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They emptied their pockets and followed him.
He was walking along when he saw Zebedee's sons, James and John, mending their nets in a boat with their father Zebedee. He called them.
And in the meantime, He went out to the mountain and sat down. Jesus taught, preached, and healed the sick (Luke 6:17-19)
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
The news has spread throughout Syria. We have brought the patients, with all kinds of diseases and ailments, including residents, injured, and disabled people. May God heal them.
They were followed by a group of people from Galilee, the region known as the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
A scout of Jesus led the people to the mountain and sat down at that time, and his disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Bless their hearts! I hope they find comfort.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled!
Blessed are the merciful! May they be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart! They shall see the face of God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God!
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
May you be in good health. People will envy you, torment you, and say disheartening words to you. But all that talk is on my mind!
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you.» Salt and Light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
And there's not a single one who lights a lantern and puts it under a basket, but he puts it on a high stand and it shines for everyone in the house.
"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." The Law
"I have come to you to perfect the law and the prophets, not to abolish them. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."
Behold the truth: The sky and the earth will not pass a single letter or a dot of the law until everything is fulfilled.
Whoever does not keep the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called the smallest in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
"Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Hypocrisy
# Hosea 20:13; Isaiah 5:17; 16:18 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not kill, and whoever kills will be subject to judgment.'"
And Anna Rani says to you: He who deceives his brother must be judged by the court, and he should say to his brother: O ignorant one, the Jewish council must judge him, and he should say to his brother: O beast, he must enter hell.
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
Go and first be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
If someone complains about you, try to resolve the issue with them as soon as possible before you both end up in court, so they don't complain about you to the judge, the judge talks to the police about you, and you end up in jail.
"Believe me: I won't leave until you pay the last penny." The sin.
# Hosea 20:14; Zechariah 5:18 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'You shall not murder.'"
I am Anna Rani, I take you to everyone who hides from me and desires me, he has sex with me in his heart.
If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
"And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." Divorce (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
# Matthew 24:1-4 "And Jesus said to them, 'It is written, "He who divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce."'"
"Amma Anna Rani says to you: He who divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery, leaves her to commit adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman does so to commit adultery." The two oaths.
# Isaiah 19:12; Jeremiah 30:2; Zechariah 23:21 "And you have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not swear falsely, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you make.'"
I'll tell you the truth, don't swear on everything, not even on the sky where God's throne is.
# Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:49; Psalm 48:2 Neither by the earth on which it stands, nor by Jerusalem on account of the city of the great King.
I swear on your head, not even a single hair, whether black or white, will fall from your head.
"Let what you say be yes or no; anything more than this comes from the evil one." (Luke 6:29-30)
# Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'"
And I say to you: Do not resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
Let him fight with you, that's what you brought him for. Let him take your coat, give him more.
If someone forces you to walk a kilometer with them, walk a meter with them.
"Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Love your enemies (Luke 6:27-28, 32-36)."
"You have heard that it was said,
Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
Blessed are ye, children of the Most High. Let your thoughts be as the sun, shining upon the just and the unjust; and let your rain fall upon the righteous and the unrighteous.
What salary do you deserve if you love those who love you? Brother, isn't it those who don't understand taxes who do this?
What if someone else issued a fatwa against you if you didn't submit? Brother, don't those who don't know if God can do this to them?
"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Charity
"When you do good, do not do it in front of people to be seen by them; if you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
Give me time to give charity to someone, don't announce it like the hypocrites do in mosques and streets so that people thank them. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
You, on the other hand, give me a hand and don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
"Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." (Luke 6:38) "The prayer" (Luke 11:2-4)
And when you come, do not be like the hypocrites, for you see them standing and praying in the congregations, showing off to people. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.
But you, tell me to pray when you enter your house first, kiss the door, and pray for your face that it may not be seen. And the face that is seen in secret will reward you.
And don't just sit there, stop repeating empty talk. How do other people, what's on their minds, they say a few words so that God may hear them.
They're not like them, because of how much they know what you need before you even ask.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
We did not enter the experiment, and from evil, we were saved.
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
"For if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses." Fasting
And as for fasting, why do you show sadness on your faces when the hypocrites turn their faces away in despair to show people that they are fasting? I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.
Hey you, come on, fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
"Let fasting be your delight, not showing off to people. But what is seen by your Lord, whom your eye cannot see, and your Lord who sees what you do in secret, may He reward you." The wealth (Luke 12:33-34)
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal."
Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
"Where is your treasure, there will be your heart also." Light of the body (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lantern of the body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
"Again, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" God and not money (Luke 12:22-31; 16:13)
No man can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
But tell me, what do you know about your lives, how you eat or how you drink, or about your belongings, how you dress? Brother, isn't life better than food, and the body better than clothing?
Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Who among you is the one who can make the sun rise in Amr's hour?
Why do you bother with clothes? Just tell the girls to bring stuff that doesn't require much effort: no work, no fuss.
Even King Solomon, in all his glory, never wore anything like one of these!
If God were to wear this chemical weed, even though weed grows today and tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire of the oven, then perhaps you are more deserving to wear it because your faith is weak!
Why don't you just keep quiet and say: What will we eat? Or what will we drink? Or what will we wear?
Your Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
"Don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Do not judge others (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
Do not judge others so that you are not judged.
What you judge others with, you will be judged with, and what you measure others with, you will be measured with.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?
ولا كيفاش تنجم تقول لخوك: "Let me remove the speck from your eye" while you have a plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite! You should remove the plank from your own eye first. Then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. Ask, and it shall be given you;" (Luke 11:9-13)
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."
The path of him who seeks shall be granted, and he who strives shall find, and he who knocks shall be opened unto.
Whoever among you asks for a child, and it is given to him a room,
And if they ask for a fish in a whale, will he give them a snake?
If you are the wicked ones, you know how to give your children luxurious things, so why can't He who is in the sky give luxurious things to those who ask Him?
"Work with people on the things you want them to do with you. This is what the Sharia and the Prophets have said: 'The narrow gate' (Luke 13:24)."
"Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate of destruction is wide and easy to enter, and there are many who go in."
"For a bad tree produces bad fruit, and a good tree produces good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush." The tree and its fruit (Luke 6:43-44)
"Repel them with the same as the lying prophets, they come to you dressed in the garb of honor, but they are from within a serpent that does not show mercy."
The pot reveals their contents. Brother, does the thorn bring grapes, or does the bramble bring pomegranates?
Every prosperous tree yields a prosperous fruit, and every barren tree yields a barren fruit.
The magnificent tree does not yield a worthless fruit, nor does the worthless tree yield a magnificent fruit.
Every tree that does not bear abundant fruit is pruned and thrown into the fire.
"By their fruits you will know them." (Luke 13:25-27)
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
On the Day of Judgment, some people will say: "O Lord, O Lord, why were we not informed in Your name? And we went out to the lands in Your name? And we did great things in Your name?"
"And I will say to them: 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness!' Like the house built on the sand (Luke 6:47-49)."
He who hears my words and acts upon them shall be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock.
The rain poured, floods came, the wind blew strongly on the house, but it didn't collapse, because its structure is built on stone.
Let him hear these words of mine and not act upon them, so that he may not be like an ignorant man who built a house on sand.
"Rain poured down, floods came, and the wind blew on this house, my brother. It's gone, not a thing left of it."
And as Jesus finished saying these words, the people were amazed at His teaching,
He knew how power worked, not how their books did.
The leper was cleansed (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.
And near him was a leper, who prostrated and said: "My lord, if you love yourself, you will heal me."
And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
# Luke 14:2 And Jesus said, "See that you say nothing to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them." But the servant of the centurion, whom he highly valued, was sick. (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-54)
And Jesus came into Capernaum, and a centurion came to him, asking for help.
"Oh my lord, my servant is paralyzed and bedridden at home, suffering from a stroke and unable to move."
And Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
My lord, we do not deserve that you come and enter under my roof. But say a word and my servant will be healed.
I am Queen Anna. I have men who judge and I have soldiers who are judged. We say to one, "Go!" and he goes. To another, "Come!" and he comes. And to my servant, "Do this thing!" and he does it."
"Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I will tell you a parable: some people will come from the east and west and sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
"May the sons of the kingdom throw themselves into the darkness, and tomorrow will be weeping for two years."
And Jesus said to the captain of the temple: "Go, and let him be healed according to your faith." And the servant was healed at that very moment. Peter's mother-in-law was healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41)
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying down with a fever.
He slipped from her hand, oh my, she's been bewitched. She stood up and left him to serve himself.
In the evening, as the sun set, they brought a group of people from the village, and the spirit spoke a single word, healing all the sick.
# Isaiah 53:4 And this is what he bore for us, the sickness that Isaiah spoke of: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases." Jesus and the World (Luke 9:57-62)
When Jesus saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he told his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.
And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
And Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another one of the disciples said, "Our Lord, let us first go and bury our father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead!" Jesus calms the storm (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
Give me a break, when Jesus went out to the countryside, his disciples got mixed up.
A strong wind blew across the lake, and the waves were beating against the boat, but Jesus was sleeping.
And He tested his servants and evaluated them, saying: "O Lord, protect us, lest we perish!"
And Jesus said to them, "Why are you so fearful, O you of little faith?" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed and said, "Who is this that even the wind and the lake obey him!" (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
And when Jesus came to the other side to the region of the Gadarene, they met Him two demon-possessed men coming out of the tombs, who were so exceedingly violent that no one could pass that way.
They were shouting: "What agreement is there between us and you, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?"
They were a group of shepherds tending to their flock in a distant pasture.
And the citizens surrounded him and said: "If you make us leave, send us to the alliance!"
He said to them: "Walk!" So they went out and entered the cave, and they all descended from the edge of the mountain into the sea and drowned in the water.
They fled, were released, and entered the city. They spoke of everything, and the men of Zoz who lived among the citizens were involved.
People, come out to meet Jesus. They all wanted to see him and asked him to leave their region.
Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26) And again
And Jesus entered into a boat, and passed over, and came into his own city.
Then Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my child; your sins are forgiven."
There is a group of Jewish scribes who said in their hearts: "This man is blaspheming!"
"Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, 'Why do you think evil in your hearts?'"
Is Anna the easiest? It is said: "Your sins are forgiven," not "Arise and walk?"
"Truly, I say to you, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic, "Rise, pick up your bed and go home."
Get up and go home.
And when the people saw what had happened, they feared and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. Jesus called Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32)
And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he got up and followed Him.
When Jesus was reclining at the table in Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were eating with Jesus and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
"When Jesus heard this, he said, 'It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.'"
# It is 6:6. Let's learn what this verse means: "We love mercy, not sacrifice." And we have come to call not the righteous, but sinners." Fasting (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them: "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one tears an old garment to patch it with new cloth, for the new cloth will tear away from the old, and the tear will be worse.
"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved." The little girl lives, and the woman who had touched Jesus is healed. (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
When Jesus spoke to them, a ruler came and knelt before Him, saying, "My daughter has just died. Come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus went forth, and his disciples followed him.
A woman who had been suffering from nosebleeds for two years came, bringing with her the items they had used.
In her heart, she said to herself: "We must have been very naughty to get this sick."
"Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment."
When Jesus arrived at the Jewish leader's house and saw the crowd in an uproar and people weeping and wailing,
He said: "Back off! The structure isn't dead, it's just lying dormant."
When the servants left, he entered and grabbed the girl by her hand. She stood up.
And the news of this thing is published on this side. Jesus heals two blind men.
And as Jesus passed on from there, behold, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Give me an example of when you entered the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
And Jesus, perceiving their faith, said to them, "Let it be done to you as you believe."
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus warned them, saying, "See that no one knows!"
Jesus healed a man there.
The buzzards are blind, coming out. There's a gang that brought us one with a sack, they're like devils.
Jesus cast out the devil and the demons, and they could no longer speak. His brothers were amazed and said, "We've never seen anything like this in Israel!"
And the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons." Jesus had compassion on the people.
And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
People saw them with contempt because they were always talking and playing, not taking care of the sheep they didn't own.
He said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
"Please ask the master of the patient to send servants with supplies for the patient."
The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
And he called the twelve disciples and gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
Simon who betrays his country, and Judas Iscariot who is about to betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
The shepherds of the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And these are the signs which will accompany
Heal the sick, honor the dead, heal the sick with leprosy, expel the citizens. Take without pay, give without pay.
Your belts contain neither gold nor silver nor copper.
No purse, no trousers, no sandals, no staff, for the sake of the servants, they deserve what they eat.
And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you depart.
And when they enter a house, greet the people therein.
May they deserve your wishes, let your peace be upon them. But if they do not deserve it, your peace should return to you.
And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.
"Behold, I tell you: The fate of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment will be better than the fate of this city!" The persecution that is to come (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
"Hani, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
They brought you in on their own heads so that they may deliver you to the Jewish council, and flog you in their synagogues.
And you will shake hands with the rulers and kings in my mind, so that you can testify before them and before other peoples.
Give me your word that you won't say anything, how you will speak or what you will say. I want you to be at this hour so that the words you will say won't fail you.
Watch what you say, let your actions speak for you.
The brother-in-law delivers his brother to death, and the son to his father, and the children turn against their parents and kill them,
And everyone will hate you because of my name. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you the truth: you will not have gone through all the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not greater than his teacher, nor is the servant greater than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. (Luke 12:2-7)
Do not fear them at all. There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be known.
Say it to them in the darkness, say it in the light. Let it be whispered in your ears, shout it from the rooftops.
And do not fear what they fear, but fear Me, if you are believers. They cannot harm you except for [some]
What are these locusts being sold for a franc? And those that fall to the ground are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Keep going until your Russian hair is counted.
Don't be afraid, you're better than a bunch of monkeys!
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
"Whoever denies me before men, I will deny him before the angels in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
We come to you with an offer of peace for the land, we did not come to bring peace, but to bring a sword.
Get to distinguish between the boy and his father, the girl and her mother, and the daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
The enemies are a man's property as long as they are his hopes.
He doesn't love his dog or his mother more than me, as much as he deserves me. He doesn't love his son or his daughter more than me, as much as he deserves me.
ولي ما يهزش الصليب متاعو ويتبعني، ما يستاهلنيش. Whoever shakes the cross for his stuff and follows me, is not worthy of me.
"He who seeks to gain his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it." The reward (Mark 9:36-41)
He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me.
A prophet is rewarded for his prophetic mistakes, and a free man is rewarded for his free mistakes.
"Let him give to one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple. Truly I say to you, his reward will not perish."
John's disciples (Luke 7:18-35)
And after Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
John heard in prison about the works of Christ, and he sent two of his disciples.
They said: "Are you the one coming, or are we waiting for someone else?"
Jesus replied, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard:
# Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
"Healthy is for those who don't doubt!"
Give John's disciples a chance. Jesus began to speak to the people about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
What made them go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? Look at those who wear expensive clothes in the palaces of kings!
What did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes indeed, and we tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Malachi 3:1; Mark 1:2 This is what is written in the Holy Scriptures: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. But I say to you that among those born of women there is none greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing by force, and the forceful seize it.
The prophets and the scripture prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to believe, he is Elijah, who is to come.
He has two ears, let him listen!
How does this generation resemble the previous one? It's like kids sitting in the market and crying at each other:
Welcome to you and may you not be tired, And welcome to you and may you not cry.
John the Baptist neither eats nor drinks. They said, "He has a demon."
"Behold, we have left all and followed You." But He said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life." (Luke 18:28-30)
And He began to reproach the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent.
He said: "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
And Anna says to you: May the state of the cities of Tyre and Sidon be better than your state on the Day of Judgment.
And you, Capernaum! Will you be exalted to the sky? You will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Sodom than for you." Jesus rejoiced (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at that time and said: "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children."
Yes, father, your will be done.
Father gave me everything. Even one who doesn't know the son was the father, and even one who doesn't know the father was the son. And everyone chose the son to show him.
Eugly, you are two players and your burden is heavy. I will control you.
استهزئوا بحقيبتتي وتعلموا مني، أنا طيب القلب متواضع، وسوف تجدون راحة في نفوسكم.
"The weight of my luggage is not heavy and my load is light."
**Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)**
At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
"When the Pharisees saw this, they asked him, 'Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.'"
# 1 Sam 21:1-6; Luke 24:9 Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
How did he enter my master's house, and all the bread of the offering, which he ate was not lawful for him nor for those who were with him? But it was lawful for the priests to eat it, right?
# Matthew 28:9-10 But you have not read how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are guiltless.
There is someone here greater than the structure.
# He is 6:6; Matt 9:13 And if they had known what this verse means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." Then they would not have condemned you for what you eat.
"Anna, daughter of man, is the Lord of the Sabbath." The man with the withered hand is healed (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
And Jesus went into the temple of those who were with him.
There was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse Him.
Jesus said to them, "Which of you, if you have a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?"
People have more value than what they own! Why shouldn't they be allowed to do good on Saturdays?
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored as sound as the other hand.
The chief priests and the Pharisees went to the council and said, "What are
And Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there. And a large crowd followed Him, and He healed them all.
And ordered them not to inform him up to a certain point.
Behold, this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
# Psalm 42:1-4 As the deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, O God. I thirst for God, the living God. When can I come and stand before him? Day and night I weep as I think of you; my appetite is lost and I moan. I say to myself, "Why go on living? Why spend more time on my knees?" But each day the Lord pours his unfailing love upon me, and through each passing night I sing his songs, praising him for his help.
He doesn't work hard nor does he shout, and even those in the streets don't hear his voice.
A strong rope that cannot be broken, and a wick that keeps burning. Until the truth prevails.
And the people should have hope in the name of Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at that time they brought to Him a blind man possessed by a demon. And when Jesus saw him, He spoke and looked.
And all the people wondered and said, "Is this not David's son?"
The Pharisees, when they heard this, said, "This man casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
And if Anna goes out with Beelzebul, with whom do your disciples go out? For this reason, they will accuse them. That is why they will judge you.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.
The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.
Here is why we told you: the sins of people and their blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." The tree and its fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
"Either have the tree be fruitful and its fruit fruitful. Or have the tree be barren and its fruit barren. You can tell the tree by its fruit."
You wicked children, how can you say such noble words when you are evil? The tongue speaks what is in the heart.
The magnificent man brings forth magnificent needs from the magnificent treasure within his heart, and the disappointed man brings forth disappointing needs from his disappointed heart.
Behold: Every empty word people utter, they will be held accountable for on the Day of Judgment.
"Walk by what you say, you appear innocent, and by your words, you are controlled." The Pharisees ask for a sign (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
They said to Jesus, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
And this is how He answered them: "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
# Jonah 1:17 And just as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
# Jonah 3:5 Let Nineveh stand with this generation on the day of judgment and condemn it, for they repented at Jonah's preaching; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
# I Mel 10:1-10; II Ach 9:1-12 and the queen of the south will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here!" Return of the Unclean Spirit (Luke 11:24-26)
The moment the displaced soul departs from a human, it transcends into places where there is no water to find rest, not even a drop.
The time has come: "Let's return to the home I left." And he returns to find it empty, dusted, and organized.
And he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter the man, and their condition becomes worse than it was before. And thus it is that the evil generation of this time is increased." But Jesus' mother and brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
When Jesus was still speaking to the people, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak with Him.
There's someone who said: "Your mom and siblings are outside, they want to talk to you."
The man she spoke to replied: "Who is your mother, and who are your brothers?"
He stretched out his hand towards his students and said: "Ahoma, my mother and siblings."
"Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
Jesus went out from the house that day and sat by the side of the lake.
They taught me about it from a group of people, until one day I went out in a boat, and everyone was standing on the shore.
Their sayings are full of proverbs: "The farmer went out to sow."
While he was planting, a seedling fell into the furrow, and the birds came and ate it.
There's another seedling that fell in a stony land, not a speck of soil, brother, it grew over time because of its soil, not a speck.
The moment she stepped out, the sun burned and withered her because she had no veins.
Another seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
There is another seedling that has been uprooted in a fertile soil and brought forth filth; there is the locust that brings bitter waters that do not irrigate, and there is the locust that brings sixty, and there is the locust that brings thirty.
"To those who have ears to hear, let them hear!" Why Jesus spoke in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
He called his disciples to him and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And their answer was: "You are not given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but they are given to others."
Keep what you have, so it breaks down more and you can get a new one. As for what you don't have, even the thing you have, just let it go.
Behold, they attribute to Us that which We possess no knowledge of, and say, "This is nothing but a man inventing a lie against Allah." They say, "We are not going to believe you until you bring down to us a sign from your Lord." Say, "The sign is only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner."
# Isaiah 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27 The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them which says: By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.
The spirit of this people has become hardened, they have stopped up their ears and closed their eyes, so that they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts. Send them back to me that I may heal them.
You are a blessing to my eyes because of her, and a joy to my ears because of her.
We tell you the truth: Prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it. Interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
Listen up, what do you understand by the example of the farmer:
The one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the rocky ground.
He is the one who plants in the good soil, who hears the word and accepts it with joy:
But it doesn't have veins inside, be patient for a while, and when the time comes, it will be difficult or persecuted for the sake of the word, at that time it will fall.
But he who sows in the midst of thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
He who plants in the fertile soil is he who hears the word and understands it, and he responds with a quick sprout. And there is he who responds with a watered plant, and another with sixty, and another with thirty." Like the sower.
And say to them, Jesus gave another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
When the people were sleeping, the enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and left.
The wild radish sprouted and grew with the wheat, and the darnel came up with it.
The servants came to the master of the land and said, "Our lord, our brother, did you not plant a beautiful seed in your land? Where did these weeds come from?"
He said to them: "One of my enemies did this." He said to the servants: "Do you want us to go and get the flowers?"
He said: "No, don't cut the wheat when it's wet. You'll get sick in the cold."
"Let the wheat and the tares grow together until the time of harvest, and at that time we say to the reapers, 'Gather the tares first and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.'" "Like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade." (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And he gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field."
She is the smallest of them all, but when she grows up, she will not be the greenest of them all, nor a tree, to the extent that birds of the sky come and nest in her.
He gave another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till all of it was leavened."
This is what Jesus said to the people in parables, and he did not say anything to them without a parable.
# Surah 78:2 This is what they said the Prophet would say: "Let my mouth speak in parables, and let me tell the hidden mysteries since the world was created." Interpretation of the parable of the Zuan
At that time, Jesus entered the house and His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
Answer them: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,"
The field is the world, and the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one,
The enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels.
And just as the locusts have stingers and burn with fire, so too shall it be at the end of time.
Anna, the Son of Man, will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
And cast them into the midst of the fire, which shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
The time is now for the righteous, let them shine like the sun in their kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear!» Like treasure and diamonds and the net
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
He sold everything he had and bought it, for a piece of gold is precious.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind.
Time passed, they went out fishing, sat by the shore, and put the magnificent whale in baskets, and threw away the disappointing one.
And thus it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
And cast them into the midst of the fire, and the one who comes will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The new and the old.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Do you also not understand this parable?" They said to him, "Yes, we do."
He told them: "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
And when Jesus finished this parable, He went away to Galilee.
And when he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Where are all the girls' shoes? Where did this man bring this thing, this mess?»
And they complained about him. Jesus said to them, "A prophet has no honor in his own country and in his own house."
And I didn't do miracles for them because they didn't believe in them.
The Death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, King Herod heard about Jesus.
He told his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."
Before Herod, John had been arrested, bound, and put in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip, Herod's brother,
They said to John: "It's forbidden for you to take it."
Love kills, but they feared for the people because of them, they thought John was a prophet.
When it was Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced at the party, and she pleased Herod,
That's why he promised her and swore to her that he would give her anything she asked for.
And like her mother, she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
The king's sorrow, however, was that he had to break the thing he loved for the sake of the oath he had sworn and the guests.
John's head was cut off in prison
They brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, oh brother, shake it for his mother.
The disciples of John gathered up the pieces and buried them, and went and told Jesus. Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself. But when the crowds heard of this, they followed him on foot from the towns.
He landed and saw a group of people. He greeted them and healed their ailments.
In the evening, he called his disciples and said to them: "The day is over, and the marketplace is empty. Let the people go to the villages and buy something to eat."
Jesus said, "They don't have to go away. You give them something to eat."
قالولو: "We had five loaves and two fish."
Jesus said: "Bring them to Me here."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
All of them are satiated and satisfied. They shook their heads with a full, generous gesture.
And those who ate the loaves were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21)
And he precisely ordered his disciples to go ahead of him to the other side to the place of the lake, so that he might send the people away.
After sending the people, they were inspired and went up to the mountain to pray. After the sun set, the next day they went up again.
The time was when the flock was far away, a little on the shore, and the wave overcame it. Due to the wind, it turned it back.
Before daybreak, Jesus came walking toward them on the water.
The disciples were afraid when they saw him walking on the water and said, "It's a ghost!" and began to shout in fear.
And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid!"
And Peter answered Him, saying, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." Peter went out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
The boy was scared of the strong wind, he started to drown, and began to cry: "Oh Lord, save me!"
"Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the
And they set out in the boat with the wind at their backs.
And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and moored to the shore. And when they came out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well. (Mark 6:53-56)
And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
And I hope that the people of this country will know Jesus, spread the news about Him throughout this entire region, and bring all the sick people here.
They asked him to let them touch the edge of what they were tattooing. And he let everyone touch it.
Traditions of the Elders (Mark 7:1-13)
The scribes and the Pharisees, who were from Jerusalem, came to Jesus and said:
"Why don't your students respect the elders' customs? And why don't they wash their hands before eating?"
Answer them: "Why do you not obey the command of Allah and build a mosque in your customs?"
# Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9 God said: "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death."
You say, if someone tells their father or mother, "I was helping you by giving you to God, you don't have to honor them."
And you have made the word of God void by your tradition.
O hypocrites, Isaiah's prophecy came true when he said about you:
# Isaiah 29:13 These people draw near with their mouth and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
"In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'" He said to them, "What comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person." (Mark 7:14-23)
And Jesus called the people to him and said, “Hear and understand.”
"Whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is expelled from the body. But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these make a person 'unclean.'"
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Do you know that the Pharisees deceived when they heard this word?"
Answer them: "Every tree that you did not plant with your own hands in the sky will not be uprooted."
Begone with them! Here are the blind leading the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
And Peter said to Him, "Explain the parable to us."
Jesus said: "Oh, you of little faith, why do you still not understand?"
Hey, you guys don't see anything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach, and doesn't come out of the body?
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
The heart brings forth evil thoughts, murder, adultery, corruption, theft, false testimony, and disbelief.
"These things defile a man. But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man." The faith of the Syrophoenician woman (Mark 7:24-30)
And Jesus withdrew from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came and cried out, «Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon.»
He only answered her with a single word. Then his disciples came and rebuked her, saying, "Send her away, for she keeps shouting at us!"
Jesus replied: "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"She came and knelt before him, saying: 'My lord, help me!'"
Her response was: "Those damn kids took the bread and threw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes indeed, sir! Even dogs eat what their masters drop from the table."
Jesus replied, "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you wish." And at that moment, she was healed. Jesus healed many others as well.
And Jesus departed from there, and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon. And He came to a house, and desired that no one should know of it; but He could not escape notice.
And in Java, a group of people came with paralyzed individuals, the blind, the deaf, and the mute, and others, and they placed them before his feet, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled recovering, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10)
And Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them, "The people have stayed with me three days now without anything to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, for they may faint on the way."
And the disciples said, "Where could we buy bread in the wilderness to feed these people, for everyone is hungry?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus ordered the people to sit down on the ground,
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
All of them were not satisfied, and they shook the seven large, full bags.
There were four thousand men, apart from the women and children.
After sending the people away, he went up into the mountains to pray. Then he came to the region of Magdala.
The signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
Jesus replied: "You say, 'In the evening there will be fine weather, for the sky is red.'"
In the morning, say: "There is rain today, for the sky's sake is dark red." You know how to interpret the state of the sky, but the signs of the times you do not know how to interpret them.
An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” And he left them and departed. The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
Connect the students to the opposite shore, make sure they bring the bread with them.
Jesus said to them: "Beware and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
And the disciples discussed among themselves, saying: "This is because we have no bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying and replied, "You have so little faith! Why are you arguing among yourselves about having no bread?
Bro, did you not understand? Bro, don't you remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand from a large basket and there was still some left over?
Do you have seven loaves for four thousand people and a few small fish?
How is it that you do not understand that we are not talking about bread? They replied, "It is because you have no leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
At that time, when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" And
فِيمَا زَمانٍ، إِذْ كَانَ يَسُوعُ قَادِمًا إِلَى قَيْصَرِيَّةَ فِيلِيبُّوسَ، سَأَلَ تَلَامِيذَهُ قَائِلًا: «بِمَاذَا يَقُولُ النَّاسُ عَنِّي؟ مَنْ أَنَا ابْنُ الإِنْسَانِ؟»
Answer them: "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say you are Elijah, and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."
He said to them: "Well, who are you two talking about?"
Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
"Give us the keys to the kingdom of heaven, so that what is bound on earth is bound in heaven, and what is loosed on earth is loosed in heaven."
At that time, he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus first tells of his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
And behold, the time came when Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.
And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from You, Lord! This shall not happen to You!"
"Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.'"
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: "If anyone loves to follow Me, let him not love his soul and take up his cross and follow Me,"
The one who loves to complete his life loses it, and the one who loses his life for my sake will gain it.
What is the benefit of man if he gains the whole world and loses his life? And what is the thing for which man should ransom his life?
I, Anna, the daughter of man, am coming with the angels in the glory of the Father, and at that time to reward each person according to what they have done.
Behold, I tell you: There are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The Transfiguration of Jesus (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36) After six days
After six days, Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
They transformed before them, and their faces shone like the sun, and their garments became white as light.
And there appeared to them Elijah and Moses, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
And as he continued to speak, their hearts were filled with a dark cloud, and the voice of the cloud said: "This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were afraid.
And Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
They looked at me and laughed, all they saw was Jesus alone.
"As they were going down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, 'Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.'"
And the disciples asked him, "Why do the Jews say that Elijah must come first?"
Tell them: "Indeed, Elijah is coming, and he will set everything right."
And behold, they brought to him a man named Elisha, whom they did not know, but they had done to him what they loved to do to everyone. And the Son of Man will be handed over to be tormented at their hands.
And at that time the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all his sayings in the audience's hearing, behold, a certain centurion came, and fell down before him, saying:
"O Lord, have mercy on my child, who is always having seizures and suffering. He constantly falls into fire and water."
"And I brought it for your students, but they didn't seem to want it."
And Jesus answered and said to them, “O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.”
And Jesus cast out the devil, and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
That time, Jesus' disciples came to him and said, "Why can't we drive it out?"
He said to them: "Because of your weak faith! I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. And nothing will be impossible for you."
# ‏17‏:21 There are ancient texts containing this verse: As for this kind, it comes out only by prayer and fasting. Jesus speaks a second time about his death and resurrection (Mark ‏9‏:‏30‏-32; Luke ‏9‏:‏43‏-45).
"While the disciples were gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,'"

Jesus, going to Capernaum, sent messengers to the disciples about the temple tax to Peter and said to him: "Teacher, does your master pay the tax?"
Answer: "Yes indeed." Then he said to him, "Go, and when you enter the house, tell it, 'The Teacher says, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth collect customs and taxes—from their sons or from strangers?'"
Peter said: "From the Bahrainis." Jesus said: "Not at all, the sons of the country are free."
"Well, we don't want to cause them any trouble, go to the lake and cast the fishing line, and when you catch a fish, take your time to examine it. You'll find enough silverware to pay for yourself and me. Shake it and we're done with your and my taxes."
