Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them
He said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles himself and becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
A man who accepts a small child on my behalf, how could he not accept me?
And what causes a person to stumble is that which they are given good by, if it were a large room belonging to a mill at his neck and is thrown into the heart of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!
If your hand or foot leads you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both hands and feet intact.
"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better that you enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire." The lost sheep (Luke 15:3-7)

# ‏18‏:11 There is an old text containing this verse: I saw the Son of Man coming to save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them goes missing, would he leave the 99 in the mountain and go look for the one that's lost?
Tell you the truth, if he finds it, he will be happier with it than with the ninety-nine that he lost.
"Even camels have their young, but if they didn't, they would perish." Allowance among brothers (Luke 17:3)
If your friend is wronging you, walk away and tell him about his mistake between you two, and if he listens to your words, you have won your friend.
If he didn't hear your words, bring one witness or two others with you, so that every word spoken is attested by two or three witnesses.
If he does not listen to them, tell it to the church, and if he does not listen to the church, consider him as a pagan and a tax collector.
What I tell you is true: whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
We tell you again: If two of you agree on anything they ask for on earth, it will be done for them in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
"Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?'"
Jesus said, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
Behold, the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
They started to hold them accountable, so we brought someone who asks for money without any justification.
As the war ended, Sidou was ordered to sell himself, his wife, his children, and everything he owned to settle his debts.
"Hey, the servant fell on his knees and said: 'My lord, my lord, please be patient with me and I will take care of everything!'"
And they will mock him, and they will turn away from him, and they will forgive him for the religion.
A servant went out one day and met another servant asking for some money. The second servant said, "Help me with the money he's asking for!"
Hey, the other servant fell off his donkey and said: "Wait for me, I'll catch up."
And he (Habash) walked and was put in prison until he finished paying the debt he owed.
The servants discovered what had happened, they got worried and scared, and told their master that the calamity had occurred.
That time was called Sidou, and they said: "O servant, O wicked one! I allowed you this debt, but you have wronged me at your own peril."
"And you have no right to pity the servant who is your master, how did we pity you?"
The deception of Saydo, and Salmo to the responsible for imprisonment until Lin pays off his debt, the stuff of the kilo.
"In the same way, my heavenly Father will treat you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus finished saying these things, he left the region of Galilee. He went into the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.
A group of people followed him, and the next day, they saw them.
"Then some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?'"
Answer them: "Brother, haven't you read that those who were created first were created female and male."
# Mark 1:27; 2:24; Acts 5:31; 1 Corinthians 6:16 And he said, "Why does this man allow his mother and father to leave and cling to his wife, and the two become one flesh?"
"Love does not make two one, but one one. That is why what God has joined together, man should not separate."
# Matthew 24:1-4 They said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?"
Jesus said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But this is not the case from the beginning."
"And I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
The students said: "If this is the man's condition with Merto, it would be better if he didn't get married."
He said to them: "Not everyone will accept this message, but those whom God allows will accept it."
There are those who cannot marry because they were born that way, and there are those whom people have made unable to marry, and there are those who choose not to marry for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let those who can accept this, do so." Jesus blesses the children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
And they brought young children to Jesus, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
"Then Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'"
And he laid his hands upon them, and departed thence. The rich young man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
And one of them said, "Teacher, what good deeds must we do to have eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good. If you want to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments."
# Hosea 20:12-16; Zechariah 5:16-20 They said: "These are the commandments?" And Jesus said: "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,"
# Do not 19:18 "Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself."
The boy said: "We've done all these things, what's still missing?"
Jesus said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me!"
The boy, upon hearing this, walked away sadly, lost in his thoughts, as he owned a few things.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And I tell you again: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
Have you heard this speech, the students will be surprised and say: "Who will be able to finish this?"
"Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'"
Peter replied at that time: "Look, we have left everything and followed You, what then shall we have?"
Jesus said to them: "Truly I tell you, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever leaves his home, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands for the sake of My Name, will receive water once a day and inherit eternal life.
"Some people want to see the end first, and those at the end want to see the beginning."
The servants are like the grapes of the vine.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
An agreement with the servants to polish the silverware during the day and send them to the grapevine.
He went out with the nine, my brother saw another group standing in the market and started a fight.
He said to them: "You two, go ahead and walk towards the grapevine, and we'll give you your rights, brother, don't worry."
He went out again approximately at noon, and separated with the three things of the evening, and did the same thing.
He left around five with the evening's belongings and found other people sitting, and said to them: "Are you all just sitting here wasting the whole day?"
قالولو: "Not even one has failed us so we can serve." قاللهم: "You have increased, go and serve in the vineyard."
And the evening came, the lord of the vine said to the one who had no business: Call the servants and finish them off. He showed them the way until they reached the governor.
The group of servants who began serving with the five took their evening meal, and each of them took a silver plate.
The two of them, when they saw the others, thought about taking more than the others, so each of them took a piece of silver for themselves.
ووقتلي هوما يخلصوا تغششوا على مولى العنب، When they finish, they will surely deceive the lord of the vine.
They said: "The two servants were only there for an hour, and you've finished them off just like that, while we've been serving all day in the heat!"
"One of them replied, 'My friend, I swear I haven't wronged you. Didn't we agree on the price of the silver dish?'"
Take your right and walk. I wanted to give the last one this, just like what we gave you.
"Hey, don't I have the right to do whatever I want with my own money? And are you just jealous because I'm generous?"
Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will rise again." (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34)
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves on the way, and said to them:
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews, and they will condemn Him to death"
"And they will deliver me to the other nations, to mock me and scourge me and crucify me. And I will rise on the third day." This is what He asked for, and what Jacob and John requested (Mark 10:35-45).
And Jatoo's mother once separated from her children and prostrated herself before them, asking them for something.
Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She said to Him, “Command that these two sons of mine may sit one at Your right hand and the other at the left in Your kingdom.”
Jesus answered them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able!”
He said to them: "You are not the ones to drink my cup. But it is not for me to decide who will sit at my right and at my left. But those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When the other ten disciples heard this, they deceived the brothers.
But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them,"
But you must not have this among you. But whoever wants to be great among you, let him be your servant.
Let him who loves Yuli give Yuli Lul to you all. Let him be a servant to all people.
"Even I, the Son of Man, did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give my life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
And Jesus and His disciples went out from Jericho, and a great multitude followed Him.
And there were some blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to cry out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
Hey people, shouted at them to be quiet. But they shouted louder: "Oh Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood and called them and said to them: "What do you love, I will do for you?"
قالولو: "Oh, our master, we'd love to come back and see you!"
And Jesus rebuked them, and touched their eyes: and immediately they received their sight, and followed him.
Jesus Enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them: "Go to the village opposite you, and you will find a beast tied up with a colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me."
"If anyone speaks to you, reply: 'The Lord will provide for their needs.' And He will return to them in due time."
The thing that happened was as the Prophet said:
# Isaiah 62:11; Zechariah 9:9 Proclaim to the Daughter of Zion: "See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The young men obeyed and did as Jesus commanded them.
And they brought the colt and the donkey to him, and put their garments on them, and Jesus sat thereon.
Most people laid down on their stomachs on the road, while others cut branches from trees and placed them on the road.
# Psalm 118:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39 and those who went before them shall cry out: Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
And they said to the people, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
# Isaiah 56:7; 7:11 And He said to them, "It is written in the Holy Book: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of thieves'!"
The blind and the lame gathered around him, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this, they looked for a way to kill Jesus, because they were afraid of him, though they saw the miracles he had done. The children were shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
# Matthew 8:2 And they said, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'?"
And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he spent the night there. Jesus Curses the Fig Tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And when Jesus was returning to the city in the morning, He was hungry
And the vine saw a thorn bush by the roadside, my brother, and found nothing but leaves in it, and said to it: "You will never bear fruit forever!" And the vine withered in time.
The students were amazed as they observed what had happened and said: "Why did the vine wither at that time?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what has been done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"Anything you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and you will." The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
And when Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
Jesus answered them, “I will ask you one question. If you answer it, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things:”
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from man?" Think carefully about your answer. For if you say, 'From heaven,' he will ask you, 'Why then did you not believe him?"
But if we say, 'It is from men,' we fear the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.
The disciples answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority we do this." Like the moths, children.
What do you think? There was a man who had three sons. He went to the first and said, "Go, work in the vineyard today."
"Hey, Jaooboo Waldo: 'We're not going.' But he didn't listen and left."
And they went to the other boy and said the same thing they said to the first boy, "Hey, answer me: 'I am walking, my lord!' But he did not walk."
"Is it the sons of the tax collector who did the thing he liked for him?" The elders said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the wicked women who are seated will enter the kingdom of God before you."
"John came to some people, a man of integrity, whom they did not believe. But the tax collectors and the sinful women believed in him. Even when I was with them, you saw what happened. You did not change your mind and believe in him." The parable of the vineyard workers (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
Listen to another parable: A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a watchtower, leased it to tenant farmers, and went away to another country.
And as the time approached when the grapes ripen, the servants were sent with provisions to the vineyard to bring back the harvest.
And they seized the five servants, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned the third with rocks.
Send your grapevine servants again, even more than you did the first time, brother. Make them do the same thing.
He said to them, "You can take my son."
They conspired against him, and said, "Kill the boy and cast him far away, and you will have ease with his brother, and we will be among the inheritors [of the property]."
And they dragged him out and took him out of the grapevine's shadow and killed him.
"Is it possible that the owner of the vineyard will come this year to work in the vineyard?"
And the elders of the Jews said: "Let him kill Hacala the wicked and give the grapevine to five others, so that they may give him the fruit of the grapevine in its time."
# Psalm 118:22-23; Acts 4:11; 1 Peter 2:7 Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.'"
"Here is why I tell you: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit."
# ‏21‏:44 There are ancient texts containing this verse: I saw the Son of Man coming to save the lost.
And when they had heard the chief priests and the Pharisees, they understood that he spake of them.
They tried to pull him away, but they were afraid of the people, for their sake, they considered him a prophet.
And one of the company said unto him,
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
The servants were sent to call the guests for the wedding's evening meal, but they hadn't arrived yet.
And he sent servants again and said: "Tell the guests: Hani has arrived with the evening festivities, the oxen and the fat cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready for the wedding feast!"
They didn't calculate the night shift and were about to leave. One went to get his things, and the other went to the kitchen.
And others mistreated the servants, plundered their belongings, and killed them.
The king deceived them, sent soldiers to bring their belongings, and killed the criminal. This is your reward, and he destroyed their city.
And the waiter said to the staff: "The bill has arrived, but the guests are not worth it,"
"Wander the streets and call out to people to join the night's wedding celebration."
The servants went out to the road and brought back the guests, both the happy and the sad ones. Brother, the house of the bridegroom is filled with guests.
My lord, when it was time for the king to see the guests, he saw a man not wearing proper attire. He said to him:
How did you get in here without wearing the wedding outfit? The man remained silent.
And then the king said to the servants: "Take him by his hands and feet and throw him into the wilderness in the darkness, and tomorrow there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"With a group of people who were sent, but a few were chosen." Rendering to Caesar the things that are Caesar's (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
The time came when the teachers of the law and the Pharisees began to plot how to trap Jesus in what he said.
And they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and do not care about anyone, for You do not look at the appearance of men, but truly teach the way of God.
Jesus said to them, "Whose image is this and whose inscription?" They said to Him, "Caesar's." And Jesus said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
"Jesus, perceiving their wickedness, said to them, 'You hypocrites! Why do you test Me?'"
"Give me the money for taxes!" "Hey, you brought me a nice piece of silver."
Jesus said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"
They said, "Caesar's things!" But he said to them, "Why put God to the test? Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's!"
And they were astonished at his words. But some of the Sadducees, who say there is
In that day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked Him a question
# Mark 12:25 And they said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us: 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.'"
There were seven brothers among us, the first one got married and died without having children, so his brother took his wife.
The same happened to the second, third, and even the seventh one.
And the more they were separated, the more the girls died.
"Emaala will be, on the Day of Judgment, a witness against them, for whose sake all of them were married."
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures or the power of God.
On the Day of Judgment, you will see them neither married nor given in marriage, but they will be like the angels in the heaven.
And you are on the resurrection, the property of the dead. Oh brother, haven't you read what Allah has said to you:
# Mark 3:6 "Isn't He the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."
And when they heard these words, they were astonished at His teaching. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
One of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test him:
"Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
# Matthew 6:5 Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
# Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 19:19; Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:9; James 2:8 and the second commandment is like it, love your neighbor as yourself.
The entire Torah and the prophets are built on this commandment, as David also says in the Psalms: "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'" David himself calls him 'Lord.' So how is he his son?" (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees had gathered together, they asked Jesus a question:
What is your opinion about the Messiah? Is he the son of someone?" They said: "The son of David!"
He said to them: "How is it that David calls Him 'Lord' while he is his son?" And He said:
# Ps 110:1; Acts 2:34-35; Heb 1:13; 10:13 The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
"if Dawud called Him 'my Lord', how could his son be?"
And not one of them would respond with a word. From that day on, no one dared to ask any question.
Jesus warns against the scribes of the Jews and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
Do what they say and keep everything they tell you. But don't do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
They place a heavy burden on people's shoulders, while they themselves do not touch it with their fingers.
They do things to be seen by others, they grow long in their prayers and lengthen their garments.
They love to sit in the front rows at parties and in the first chairs at gatherings.
They love it when people greet them in the markets, and call out to them: "Oh teachers"
But you should not wait until someone calls you: "Oh teachers", all of you are brothers and you have one teacher.
And you do not say to anyone on earth "Good morning", because you have One who is in heaven.
And you won't find anyone who calls you: "My lord" because of a lord you have, who is Christ.
And let many of you serve you
For the one who comes out of his soul descends, and for the one who humbles himself is raised.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who want to.
# ‏23‏:14 Woe to you, teachers of the law and you Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore you will be more severely punished.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Welcome, you elders, you blind ones! You say: "He who swears by the temple is not bound by his oath, but he who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath."
Anna is the one with more value, you ignorant and blind people? Is it gold or the structure that holds the gold that is sacred?
And they say: "He who swears by the altar is not bound by anything, but he who swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by his oath."
Does Anna have more value, you blind ones? The altar that sanctifies the sacrifice or the sacrifice itself?
May God strike the one who swears by the altar and by what is above it!
Whoever swears by the Kaaba, he swears by it, and whoever lives in it.
By the sky, he swears, by the throne, and by Allah who is seated upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
Ye who lead the people, O blind ones! Ye strain out the gnat and swallow the camel.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
O hypocrite, you blind guide! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside also may become clean.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
And they increased, from the outside they appeared to people as righteous, but within they were full of hypocrisy and evil.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous.
And they say, "Jinn were present at the time of our forefathers, so we did not participate in the killing of the prophets."
Behold, you witness the departure of you, the children who killed the prophets.
You have inherited and fulfilled the scale of your ancestors
يا أولاد اللفاعي، كيفاش باش تهربوا من الحكم متاع عذاب جهنم O you sons of the serpent, how will you escape the judgment of the torment of Hell?
Behold, why do We send to you messengers and wise men and scribes, some of whom you kill and crucify, and some of whom you flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city?
# Gen 4:8; Heb 11:4; Zech 1:1; 2 Chr 24:21 So that all the blood of the righteous, which has been shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar, may come upon you.
Behold, I tell you: the mourners are blessed, for they shall all come to this generation!» Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing."
Hey, your place is nice, but it's a mess.
I bring you good tidings: you shall see me no more until the time when you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Jesus speaking on the temple courts (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus went out of the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to show him the temple buildings.
Jesus said to them: "Have you seen this stone? I tell you the truth: not one stone here will remain on another; every one will be thrown down." The Catastrophe and Persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
When I was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to me privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus replied: "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek also."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and will deceive many.
And when you hear of wars nearby and wars in distant lands, do not be afraid. This thing must happen, but that is not the end.
And nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be famines, and earthquakes, in places.
This is just the first of the pains of childbirth.
And that time is for them to make you suffer and kill you. And all the peoples are to hate you because of My name.
And this time, some people will stop being believers in July, betray each other, and hate each other.
They consider some prophets to be liars and go wrong about some people.
The majority of people no longer have love for one another because of the increase in evil.
If you want to achieve something, you must finish it.

Keep it in the glove compartment so it doesn't rattle around.
Woe to them, the pregnant ones, and those who suckle in broad daylight. This is yours.
Ask your Lord that you may flee in a day not winter nor Saturday.
In that time, due to a great deal of difficulty, it has never happened that there was no way out from the very beginning.
And if God had not shortened these days, no human would have survived. But He has shortened them for the sake of the people He has chosen.
And that time, if anyone says to you: "Here is the Christ" or "There he is," do not believe it!
Beware, they will appear as good people, claiming that Christ is the Antichrist and prophets are liars, performing great deeds and miracles to deceive them, even the chosen people, if possible.
I warned you before.
Do not go out when they say to you, "Here is the Messiah in the wilderness," and do not believe it when they say, "Here he is in the inner rooms."

"And then the angels will send out their voices with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather together those whom they have chosen from the four winds, from one end of the earth to the other end of the sky." The lesson is the mercy (Mark 13:28-31; Luke 21:29-33)

And just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
People used to eat, drink, and marry in these afternoons before the floods, until Noah entered the ship.
And they were not even thinking about anything until the floods came and shook them all. That is how the time of the Son of Man will come:
The time will come when they will be two men in the year, one will shake and one will remain.
The hum of women sitting on the millstone, grinding wheat, one sways and the other stays still.
Beware, gather what you do not know about the day when your Lord will come.

"Behold, therefore, you know that you are not ready, go your way, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." As the faithful servant (Luke 12:41-48).
How can the servant know the document and know how to behave and be with them all on time to give them their food on time?
Health, why did the servant return to his master and find him serving your service.
We inform you: He will be appointed over all their properties.
"Then, if this servant turned wicked and said between me and his soul: 'Master, please go back.'"
He began to strike the other servants, and eat and drink with the scullery maid.
He will return one day when he pleases and at a time he knows not.
"May they be cut into pieces and thrown into the trash can for those who are hypocrites. Where is the weeping and the tears of years?"
Like the girls
The kingdom of heaven is like ten young bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were ignorant, and five knew how to behave.
Give the fools time to shake their lanterns, but they won't shake the oil with them.
Those who knew how to behave shook their oil containers with their lanterns.
And with that, the groom, everyone was overcome with sleep and dozed off.
At midnight, they heard a shout: "The groom is coming, come out to meet him!"
Hey girls, they all stood up and lit their flashlights.
They said the ignorant to those who knew how to behave: "Give us some of your oil, for the sake of our lamps, so they may light up."
Those who know how to behave, answer: "It may not be enough for us and for you, go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
The time came for the groom to arrive, and he arrived. He entered the house where the wedding was taking place with the guests, and they closed the door.
And the Java spacing of the other girls increased, and they said to the groom: "Our master, our master, we have opened the door!"
"Then he answered them, 'I have told you the truth: You do not know me.'"
"Behold, I tell you, lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near. But take heed to yourselves, lest
A man going on a journey summoned his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.
He gave each of them according to his ability. He gave one five bags of gold, another two bags of gold, and another one bag and left.
He took the five buttons, walked quickly, and traded them. Brother, he made a profit of five more buttons.
One hand washes the other.
Ama took a bag, went and dug in the ground, and hid Sido's money.
After a long time, the master returned and settled accounts with them.
He took the five buttons, and brought five additional buttons, saying: "My lord, you gave me five buttons, and I earned five more buttons."
They said, Sayyid Uthman: "Wake up, O faithful and steadfast servant! I was steadfast in a little, Hani, so that I may reward you for your diligence: enter the paradise that belongs to your master."
Wali took the golden coin and said, "My lord, you gave me a golden coin, now I have won another golden coin."
They said, Sayyid Uthman: "Wake up, you good and diligent servant! I was feeling a bit unwell, Hani, so I want to reward you: enter the paradise that belongs to your master."
ولي took a bag and went to him, and said: "My lord, I know that you are a harsh man. You reap what was not sown, and gather what was not planted,"
"Hey, you've been careless, walked around, and buried your belongings in the ground. Here's your money."
Ama Sido replied: "Oh servant, oh wicked one, oh fool! As you know, we reap what we do not sow and take what we do not plant,"
You had to put your money in the bank, and we would go back to take it with the interest.
He said to the servants: Take from him the mina and give it to him who has the ten minas.
The one who has should share, so that they may increase and have more. As for the one who has nothing, even what they have should be enough for them to survive.
The servant who is of no use, cast him out into the darkness. Why should there be weeping and gnashing of teeth on the Day of Judgment?

We place the sheep on our right, while the goats we place on our left.
And I will say to him who sits at my right hand, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world,"
For my sake, you were hungry and you fed me. You were thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
"You were naked, and I clothed you. You were sick, and I visited you. You were in prison, and I came to you."
"At that time, the righteous will reply, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'"
How's your time? Did you see something strange and live in it? Or were you naked and dressed in it?
How come I see you're not sick or injured, and you didn't tell me?
"And I, the king, will answer them: 'I tell you, every time you did this to one of my little brothers, you did it to me!' "
And when I say to him on my left: "Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:"
I was hungry and didn't eat, I was thirsty and didn't drink.
"I was a stranger and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and imprisoned and you did not visit me."
And if they both increase, they should say: "O Lord, we have not seen you hungry or thirsty, strange or naked, sick or imprisoned, and we have not helped you?"
"And I will tell them: 'You have the right to do that every time you didn't do this with one of my little brothers, I see you didn't do it with me either.'"

Give me, Jesus, the rest of this word, He said to His disciples:
"You know that Easter comes in two days, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to be crucified."
And at that time you will learn the chief priests and the elders of the people in the house of Caiaphas, the high priest,
And they consulted together that they might take Jesus by craft and kill him.
And they said, "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?" And they scolded her. But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good to them, but you will not always have me. She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her." (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper,
A cat brought me a very expensive perfume bottle in her mouth, and when I put it on my head, it bit me.
When the students saw her, they lied and said: "Why this waste?"
"Perfume like this used to be sold for a pittance, and given to the poor!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
The poor are always with you, but I am not always with you.
If you had poured perfume on my body, you would have prepared me for burial.
Behold, I tell you: Who would rejoice with this Gospel in all the world, who would tell of this deed of mercy, that people would always remember it." The Betrayal of Judas (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)

# 21:32; 11:12 And he said to them: "What price do you give me for the field?" And they gave him thirty pieces of silver.
And when the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him. Now he was in great distress and witnessing his agony, said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later." Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you." Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times.
They came to him, therefore, before the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, and said to him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He told them: "There is someone in the city walking around saying: 'The teacher says: My time has come, so let's eat the Passover meal at your house with my disciples.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus sat down with his twelve disciples to eat.
And while they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me."
They mourned in turns and began to say, one by one: "Brother, is it me, oh Lord?"
Answer them: "The one who puts his hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me."
# Matthew 41:9 "I tell you, the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected. As it is written in the Scriptures, he will be handed over to sinful people. But how terrible it will be for the person who betrays him! It would have been better for him if he had never been born."
Judas asked him who was betraying him: "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus replied: "You have said it." The Lord's Supper (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Take this cup and give thanks to them, and say: "Drink from it, all of you."

We tell you: We will no longer drink from this grape juice, until the day comes when we will drink with you something new in the Papa Kingdom.

# Zechariah 13:7; John 16:32 And Jesus said to them: "All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the Shepherd, And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
"Now that we have risen from the dead, I will race you to the Galilee."
"Peter said, 'Even if everyone else leaves you, I will never leave you.'"
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, tonight before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."
Peter said, "We will not deny you, even if we have to die with you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)
And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
At that time he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch."
"Then he waited a bit, fell on his knees and prayed, saying: 'Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.'"
He returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?"
They stayed up late and prayed so they wouldn't miss the experience. The soul loves to be transcendent, but the body is weak.
"And again he prayed, and said, 'O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done, and not mine.'"
He returned once more and found them sleeping, their heads resting on their arms, not even moving their heads to shake off sleep.
He left them again and then he started talking while praying for the third time.
And he said to his disciples, "Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Arise, let us be going! Behold, the one who betrays me is at hand.» Then Judas came to the garden, having a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees with him (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12).
It was still dark when he spoke in the region of Judea. He was one of the Twelve, named Judas, and with him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Wali Khan gave them a sign and said, "Whoever opens this, tie him up!"
And as He walked along, they kept saying, "Peace to you, Teacher!" and they greeted Him.
Jesus said, "My friends, let's do what I came for." At that time, they came and laid their hands on Jesus and arrested Him.
And one of them reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
And at that time Jesus said: "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Hey, why don't you think about it? I'm not the one who asks Dad, and at the same time, he sends me more than twenty armies of angels' stuff?
"Then how can you say that the sacred texts say this thing must happen?"
Jesus said to the people: "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me."
"Now the thing that happened was that what was said in the books of the prophets was fulfilled. At that time the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the council of the Jews (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24)."
And they led Jesus to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
And Peter was following him from afar, until he came to the middle of the courtyard of the house of the high priest. He entered and sat with the guards to see how it would end.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But we didn't manage, even though some people came forward and bore false witness. And they even brought in some fake witnesses.
They said: "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Said the chief priest to him, "Do you not answer anything? Do you not hear how these men are testifying against you?"
Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said, "I adjure You by the living God, tell us: Are You the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
"Top one among the priests Debshu said: 'He is an infidel! Do we still need witnesses? You all heard him say it, he is an infidel.'"
"Who has authority over him?" They replied: "He must die!"
They spat on him and struck him with their hands, and some of them slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
Peter was sitting in the middle of the house, when suddenly a servant girl came and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee!"
"Amma stood in front of them all and said, 'I don't understand what you mean.'"
When I went out to the outer door, I saw another servant and she told those present tomorrow: "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied it again and swore, "I don't know this man!"
Keep your distance from those present and tell Peter: "Indeed, you have become one of them. Be careful how you speak to them!"
The time seemed to swear and hesitate: "We don't know this man." And at the same time, the Sarduk shouted,
And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
In the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people conspired together against Jesus to put him to death.
And they laid hands on him and shook him and delivered him to Pontius Pilate. The death of Judas (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
He said to them: "I have sinned in that I have betrayed the blood of an innocent person." They said: "What does that matter to us? See to that yourself."
And he cast the silver in the temple, and went out. And Jairus's daughter walked.
They, the chief priests, shook the silver and said: "It's not right to put it into the temple treasury, since it's blood money."
They misunderstood and bought it from the potter to make a cemetery to bury the brain-dead in.
This is why today is called the "bloody Sunday".
# Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 32:6-15; 18:2-3 And the thing that the prophet Jeremiah said: "And I shook down the thirty pieces of silver, the price set by some of the sons of Israel."
And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, "Art thou the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said, "Thou sayest."
The text was not translated because it is not in a language that I can translate.
He said Pilate: "My brother, do you not hear how they are testifying against you with some things?"
And he did not answer them a word, so that the governor was greatly amazed. (The judgment of Jesus by death: Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
In every festival, the governor would leave the people a sum of money to spend as they pleased.
They had at that time a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. Then when he
On account of his steps, he knew that they had handed it over to him out of jealousy.
Pilate was sitting in the court when they sent for him and said to him, "Answer us what to do with this man. We are troubled by a dream we had last night."
And the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
قاللهم الوالي مرة أخرى: «شكونو منهم لثنين تحبوني نسيبلكم؟» وهوما قالوا: «باراباس!»
Said Pilate to them: "Shall I crucify your King?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
He said: "Why, what evil have they done?" But they shouted even more: "Crucify him!"
Then Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting. So he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people replied: "We and our children are wanted for our blood!"
And they stripped Jesus and put a scarlet robe on him. And when they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit on him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3)
And the soldiers led Jesus away into the palace of the governor and gathered the whole company of soldiers around Him.
We tried to dress him and dressed him in a red outfit,
And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a reed in his hand, and bowed down before him, and mocked him, saying: "Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they spat on him, took the reed, and struck him on the head with it.
After they had mocked him, they tried to make him wear the red robe, and they put a purple robe on him and shook him to make him stand firm. Jesus on the cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)

And the chief priests and the scribes and the elders were mocking him, saying:
"Others have been redeemed, but their souls have not been redeemed! He is the King of Israel, let Him come down now from the cross and we will believe in Him."
"Mao trusted in God and said: 'I am the son of God.' Let God save them if they are pleased with him."
The criminals who were crucified with him also reviled him with their words. The death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)

# Matthew 22:1 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"

The others said: "Wait, let's see if Eliya Bash will come and finish it!"
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two; the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the tombs broke open, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
And they came out of the tombs after Jesus rose, and went into the holy city and appeared to many.
When the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that happened, they were greatly afraid and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"

He went to Pilate and asked him for Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body of Jesus, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
They buried him in a new grave they had dug for his soul in the stone, placed a large stone at the grave's entrance and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. They were keeping watch over the tomb.
And from dawn, the day after the day they prepare for, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate
He said: "Remind us, O our Lord, how the Dajjal said when he was alive: 'We will rise after three days.'"
"Now, why would I order them to keep watch over the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples don't steal him and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and deceive them even more than they were deceived before!"
Jesus said to them, "You have a guard; go and make it as secure as you know how."
They placed wax on the room and soldiers to guard the grave.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
An enormous earthquake occurred, and then an angel from my Lord descended from the sky and came to the room, sitting on top of it.
It was as if lightning struck and the snow was as white as snow.
And behold, the guards trembled in fear of him, and behold, how the dead.
The angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."

"Come, see! And tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
They returned with a lot of money, neither afraid nor happy, and they ran to the students.
And when they came to the place, they said to Him, "Peace be with You." Then they drew near and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." That is what the soldiers were told.
The women gave the soldiers time, and they returned to the city and told the chief priests about all that had happened.
The chief priests and the elders gathered and consulted together to give the soldiers money
