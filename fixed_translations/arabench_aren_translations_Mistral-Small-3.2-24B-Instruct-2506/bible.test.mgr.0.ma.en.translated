Is the chapter of the wise Muntash the kingdom of heaven?
And when they had eaten, he said, "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me." Matthew 26:21
He wept over Jesus, a young child, and stood among them.

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
The one who welcomed Polid in this manner, my name is not one to welcome him.
And the one who throws into the river is one of these children who believe in him, look at these people related to his neck a large room of the mill and is thrown into the sea cave.
Alas, people of this world, for the things that lead to sin! Not all of these things must happen, but woe unto those who cause them!
Otherwise, your hand or foot will be thrown into the Danube, cut off and thrown at you. May you enter eternal life with one hand and one foot, and may you not have two hands or two feet to throw into eternal well-being. When
Or else your eye that causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire. Matthew 5:29 the harmful sheep
If you cause one of these little ones to stumble, it is better for you that a great millstone be hung around your neck and that you be drowned in the depth of the sea. For the angels in heaven always see the face of My Father in heaven.
"The path of the son of man is to save those who are lost." # 18.11 This verse is not found in many of the ancient manuscripts.
What do you think? There's only one person who has a hundred sheep and one of them goes missing, and he won't leave the ninety-nine in the mountains to go look for the one that's missing?
Nothing compares to it: except for the one who experiences it, no one is happier than him with this joy, more than the joy of winning the World Cup at ninety.

But if you are wrong, you have the right, he has a lawyer and a prosecutor against him, not between you and him, unless you listen to me, you will be your own winner, Luke.
Otherwise, he won't listen. You have one or two witnesses with you, so every word is attested by one or two witnesses.
Otherwise, they wouldn't listen to them, he said to the people of the church, otherwise they wouldn't listen, considering it as if it were someone who worships idols or something like that, not paying tax.
Verily I say unto you: Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
Behold, I say unto you again: If two or more of you on earth agree on anything you ask for, it will be done for you by him who is in heaven.
"Wherever two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." These are the words of the servant who did not forgive.
And Peter came up and said to Jesus, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?” Luke
And Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
He brought me someone who owed him millions of silver dirhams.
When he couldn't repay, he ordered his wife, children, and all he owned to be sold to settle the debt he owed.
I will bow to you, my servant: Patience with my master, and I will return to you with what you desire.
And his master was angry with him and dismissed him and allowed him to pay off the debt he owed.
He left, and when that slave exited, he met one of his slave companions who was asking him for a hundred silver dirhams. He grabbed him and hanged him, saying: "Give me back what you asked for!"
Wait for me, and I will return to you what is yours.
But what's the point, he's in jail until he pays back the debt he owes.
They saw the slaves suffering, they were very sad and they went to tell their master about the incident that had occurred.
He is wailing to his master and says: "Oh, this servant who hasn't done anything! You have allowed him to take all the religion, and he won't fulfill my desires."
Why haven't you had mercy on your servant as I have had mercy on you?
Her mistress worried, and they imprisoned her servant to teach him a lesson until he returned what he owed.
"For there is no one of you but will desire to enter the Garden; indeed, it is an immense desire."
الطلاق Then Jesus said to them,
And when Jesus had finished saying these things, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And many groups of people followed him and saw them done.
And the Pharisees came up to him, testing him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?”
He answered them and said: "But you have not read the Book of God, for God created man from the desert, male and female."
وݣال: هادشي علاش غيخلي الراجل باه ومه وغيتاحد مع مراته، وغيوليو بجوجهم دات وحدة. Waggal: This is why the man didn't leave her and they got married, and he brought her to their home.
"For what is hidden cannot be found, but what is revealed is a single unit. And what Allah has brought together, no one can separate."
And the Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.”
"Anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
The student said to him: "If this was the case of a man with a woman, it would be better for him not to marry at all."
And Jesus answered them, “Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”
"For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to understand, let him understand." Jesus blessed the little children
People brought children so he could place his hands on them and pray with them, and they competed in bringing their students.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
He laid his hands on them and walked away. The young man who was wearing the clothes
A young man came to him and said, "Oh teacher, what good deed can we do to have eternal life?"
Jesus replied: "Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
He asked him, "Which commandments?" And Jesus answered, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,"
"Come back to me, and tell me how you're doing. How's your head?"
He said to the young man: "I have followed all these instructions, what else is left for me to do?"
Jesus replied: "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me!"
But when the young man heard this speech, he walked away sad, as he was wearing a lot.
And Jesus said to His disciples: "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
"Let me tell you something else: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"
The students were amazed when they heard this speech and said: "According to this account, who can be saved?"
And Jesus looked at them and said to them: "Men cannot do this, but God is able to do everything."
And Peter answered him, saying, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You. What then will be our reward?"
And Jesus said to them: "Truly I say to you, in the regeneration when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And whoever allows his home, his brother, his sister, his father, his mother, his children, and his land to be taken in my name, will be rewarded with something better than what he allowed a hundred times over, and his eternal life with God will be changed.
"The last shall be first, and the first shall be last." Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Maids' Metal in the Vineyard of Paradise
The way to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who has a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
And they have a dinar for the day and a siha for the gardens with it.
Jawiya al-Tasa'ud went out in the morning and found other servants standing in the market without service.
He says to them: "Go on until we reach my gardens. I will reward you with what you deserve."
And they argued. Then, he went out again in the afternoon, and went out again in the late afternoon, and added more servants.
He went out again at five in the evening, and found other servants standing and said to them: "Why are you standing here all day without serving?"
They replied: "We've served him to some extent." I told them: "Let's go, so we can reach my garden."
And in the evening, the master of the house called his agent and said: "Cry out to all the servants and give them their dismissal, starting from the last one until you reach the first."
Wajja Hadouk who had dinner in the evening and took each of them a dinar.
And the poor guy, they have an account that will end up with an extra ten, but even they took less than a dinar each.
They started to throw stones at the king's statue as they were about to finish.
We have been working for hours, and the others only worked for one hour. In the end, we are the ones who have been serving all day under the sun.
He is answering the king's messenger among them, and says to him: "I swear I have not wronged you, my friend. Did you agree with me on a dinar?"
Eva, take your right and go your way! And this is what came yesterday, I am the one who wanted to give it to you.
And do we not have the right to do what we want with our money? Or are we not allowed to be generous?
And Jesus said, "So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus predicts his death and resurrection for the third time
And when Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them on the way:
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death"
"and I will deliver him to those who do not know God, and they will mock him and scourge him and crucify him. And the third day he will rise again." Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, asking something of Jesus.
The dishes of Umm Walad Zabdi are her children for Jesus, and her prostrations to Him and her requests from Him to fulfill one of her needs.
وسولها: "What do you wish for?" and he said to her: "Command that my sons be brought to me, one on your right and the other on your left in your kingdom."
He answered Jesus, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to Him, "We are able!"
"Honestly, I'll drink their glass, but the glass on my left and right isn't something I'll give, as I'll only give it to those who found it for them."
And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly concerned about James and John.
And Jesus said to them, "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.
But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.
The one who wants to be the leader among you, especially the servant of yours.
"For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus said this to the crowd of the blind.
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
They were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to shout, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
«Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!»
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, “What will ye that I should do unto you?”
"She replied: 'We want our eyes to be sweetened by our Lord!'"
And Jesus had compassion on them, touched their eyes, and immediately they could see. And they followed Him.
Chapter Twenty-One Jesus Enters Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples.
Go to the roundabout in front of you, you will find a donkey tied up with a gazelle. Greet them and bring them to me.
"Otherwise, I will do nothing for you, nothing at all. Tell them: The Lord needs them, and he is pressing them for time."
It all happened so that the words of the Prophet would come true, which said:
"Rejoice, O daughter of Zion: Behold, thy King cometh unto thee; He is just, and having salvation; Lowly, and riding upon an ass, And upon a colt the foal of an ass."
Discipleship with Google and other such things that Jesus commanded us to do.
And they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their garments on them, and Jesus sat on them.
They gathered a large group of people and their needs on the road, and they cut down other people's tree thrones and laid them on the road.
And these were the groups of people who preceded Jesus and followed him, saying: "Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!" (Translation notes: "كيغوتو" and "كيݣولو" are transliterations of the Aramaic word "Hosanna". The rest of the text is in Arabic.)
When He entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Then Jesus went into the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling.
And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
"وݣال ليهم: «راه تكتب فكتاب الله بلي داري غادي تسمى دار الصلاة، ولكن نتم رديتوها غار ديال الشفارا!»." "Wagoul lehum: 'Rah tekteb fekitab Allah bli dari ghadi tismou dar el-salate, lakinn nettem redditoha ghar dial el-chifara!'"
And there are in the mosque of Allah
But the chief priests and the teachers of the law were disturbed when they saw the miracles he performed and when they heard the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
And He called to Him, saying, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus answered and said, "Yes. Have you never read in the Scripture: 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise'?"
And when he had cast them out, he went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
Good morning, Mr. Mili was returning to the city, starving.
He saw a fig tree by the road and went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. And He said to it, "Let no fruit grow on you ever again!" And immediately the fig tree withered away.
They saw the students who had fallen and were amazed, saying: "How could the vine have swallowed them?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you can not only do what I have done to the vine, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done.
"Whoever asks for the need that you are asking for in prayer with faith, will receive it. Who gave the authority to Jesus?"
And Jesus came to the temple, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him, saying, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said to them: "I will also ask you one question, and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven or from man?" They discussed this among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
"Otherwise, our authority comes from the people, we fear the public, lest they think John is a prophet."
They replied to Jesus and said to Him: "We do not know." And He said to them: "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the wicked vinedressers
"Your lunch is ready. One of the men had a lot of children, and he went to the vineyard and said to him: 'Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard.'"
He replied to his son and said to him: I don't want to. But he regretted it the next day and went.
He went to the second boy and spoke to him as he had spoken to the first, and the boy answered him, saying: "My master! But he did not go.
"Who do you think will enter the kingdom of heaven?" They said to Him, "The first." But Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the sinners will precede you into the kingdom of God."
John the Baptist # 21.32 is meant here. "You sent a delegation to John, and he testified to the truth. But the tax collectors and the sinners believed in him. Yet even when you saw this, you did not change your minds and believe in him." Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parable of the vineyard and the tenants
Hear another parable: There was a man who had a vineyard; he fenced it around, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country.
It is time to harvest the grapes, so the slaves are sent to the vineyard to gather the fruit.
And they beat the gardener and the Copts, and they struck one, killed another, and stoned another with rocks.
And Waad Saifatt made more than the youngsters, and they showed them the gardens as they showed the others.
And God willing, this summer, their son will say: I will respect my son.
But Mili saw the gardener, the son of the gardens, and he said to them: This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!
And they dragged him out and took him outside the vineyard of paradise and killed him.
"Eva, apart from the vineyard of paradise, what else does the gardener take care of?"
And they answered him: "Such is the fate of the transgressors; the Hereafter will be lost to them, and they will be given the wine of grapes to other gardens whose fruit they will enjoy."
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
Behold, the kingdom of God is taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
"Whoever threw this stone will be punished, and whoever the stone was thrown at will be crushed."
And when they heard the chief priests and the Pharisees, they understood that it was about them that he was speaking.
They began to turn away, trying to seize Him, but they were afraid of the crowd, for they considered Him a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-Two: The Dragon of the Wedding Gift
And Jesus spoke to the crowd again in parables, saying:
"the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who made a wedding feast for his son."
The slaves' attendant weeps for the offerings, but they don't want to come.
وعاود صيفط عبيد خرين وݣال ليهم: ݣولو للمعروضين: راني وجدت العرس ودبحت البݣر والعجول السمان وكلشي راه موجود، إيوا أجيو للعرس! Translation: And Wa'awd Saifut 'Abid Kharin said to them: Tell the exhibitors: I found the wedding and slaughtered the cows and the young bulls and everything is ready, come on, let's go to the wedding!
But they didn't put anything in it; some went out to the field with him, and some went to buy and sell.
Two other slaves were presented to him, and he had them flogged and killed.
The king was worried, and his army was destroyed, and these fighters perished, and their city was burned.
He says to his servants: "The wedding is ready, but those we invited did not deserve it."
Eva prepared a feast for everyone she met to invite them to the wedding.
They went out, the slaves to the streets, and gathered food they found, neither the well-off nor the poor, until they filled the house of the bride with guests.
The king came to see the guests, but one of the men wasn't wearing the wedding attire.
He said to me: "Why didn't you bring your friends until you came here and we don't have the wedding things?" The man remained silent as he had nothing to say.
He said to the servants: "Take him by his hands and feet and cast him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. When?"
"Many are offered, but few are chosen. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's."
The disputes of the Pharisees at that hour were to trap him into saying something wrong about him.
And they were spending the summer with their teachers, the Herodians, and they said to him: "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not show partiality to anyone, for you do not look at the person's outward appearance.
"Eva, should we eat here or at home? And should we pay the Caesar's tax or not?"
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why do you test Me, you hypocrites?
"Give me the money with tax deducted!" They gave me a dinar.
They asked: "Whose picture is this and whose money is this?"
And He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?" They said to Him, "Caesar's." And Jesus said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
والملي سمعوه تعجبو، وخلاوه ومشاو. السؤال على البعت ديال الموتى
Here is the translation: And in the morning, a delegation came to Jesus from some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection. They questioned Him, saying:
My lord, the case of Musa: A man died and left no children, so his brother married his wife to have children in his brother's name.
We had seven brothers. The eldest of them got married and died without having children. So, his wife was given to his brother to marry.
And so it happened to the second, to the third, up to the seventh.
And after that, when they all died, the woman died too.
Who will be the man of this woman the day after, when they were all her husbands?
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
In that day, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but they will be like the angels in heaven.
أما من جهة بيع الموتى، وما قرأيت لكم كلام الله مليًا:
Am I not the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
And when people heard these words, they were astonished at his teaching. The great commandment
And when the Pharisees had heard that Jesus had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
One of them was a scholar of religious law, who tried to test Jesus by saying:
"Master, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
And Jesus answered him, saying, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”
Hadi is the big will and the first.
The second advice remains the same: You want what's close to you, but how will you get it?
"And on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Luke 10:25-28, Christ and the Prophet David"
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
«What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?» They said to him, «David's son!»
He says to them: "How could David be inspired by the spirit of God to say to the Lord my Lord you said to me"
"Say to my Lord: I have come to your doorstep so that we may place our necks under your feet."
"Eva, how can David be the Lord's son? How can the Messiah be his son?"
And not one of them answered him a word, nor did any of them that day dare to ask him any other questions.
Chapter Twenty-three Jesus instructs his disciples to beware of the scribes and the Pharisees
And Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
وݣال: "The scholars of religious law and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses,"
Follow what Ewa tells you, listen to her and obey her, but do not imitate their actions when they do not do what they say.
They would pack bags that are said to be heavy, and they would place them on people's shoulders, but they would not even move a finger to help carry them.
Otherwise, they wouldn't do anything except to show people, to widen the gangs' paths so they can pass and parade, and to lengthen their veils.
The best places to be during the ceremony are the chosen seats, and the best places to be during the prayer are the front row seats.
Wikibehu, people greet him in the market and cry out to him: "Oh, my lord."
But we do not want you to leave anyone crying for you: Oh my Lord, you are all brothers and you have one Lord.
What you call father in this world, you have one Father who is the Father in heaven.
And do not let anyone judge you: for one is your teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you shall be your servant. When
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe to you, teachers of the law and you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who want to.
But woe to you, teachers of the law and you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. # 23:14 This verse is not in many of the ancient manuscripts.
Welcome, O scholars of religious law and hypocritical Pharisees! You traverse land and sea to make a single convert, and when you do, you make them twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!
Welcome, hypocritical leaders! What those who swear by the House of God say is not acceptable, but those who swear by the gold of the House of God must fulfill their oath.
Oh, the fools and the blind! Is not Hasan, the gold, and the House of God that returns the gold sacred?
Secondly: The oath taken by the slaughterhouse is not acceptable, but the one who swears by the gift above him, especially, fulfills his oath.
What a pair of idiots! Is Hassan not a Muslim? The sacrificial animal, and the one who slaughters the sacrificial animal is sacred?
The one who swears by the slaughterhouse is like the one who swears by what is above it.
The one who swears by the House of God as if he were its inhabitant, by God.
Verily, I say unto you, That whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: for whatsoever ye have loosed on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Matthew 5:34
Welcome, you scholars of religious law and hypocrites! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. You pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
Down with the practical officials! Stack it as a filter from the mosquito but tear apart sentences.
Welcome, you scholars of the law and you hypocritical Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of plunder and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
Welcome, teachers of the law and you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
And so, until we meet, they write to people from outside, as if they were God's representatives, but within you, there are those filled with hypocrisy and sins.
Welcome, you scholars of religious law and hypocritical Pharisees! You write the tombs of the prophets and adorn the gardens of the righteous.
We have lived the time of our ancestors, but we did not participate in the killing of the prophets.
And you testify against yourselves, as we are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Eva completed what your ancestors started.
Oh, Hanash, the snake's trick! How will you manage to escape the punishment of hell? When?
Upon your necks, O leaders, scholars, and men of religion, those who were killed among you, those who were imprisoned among you, and those who were beaten in your houses of worship and driven from city to city,
Woe to you, for the wrath of all innocent blood shed on the earth is coming upon you, from the blood of Abel, who feared God, to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
"Behold, I tell you the truth: all this punishment will fall on this generation!" Jesus' love for Jerusalem
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."
And here your house will remain a ruin for you.

Chapter twenty-four Jesus prophesies that the temple will be destroyed
Jesus went out and walked to the house of God, and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the house of God.
And Jesus said to them: "Have you seen all this? I tell you the truth: Not one stone here will be left on another, which will not be thrown down." Signs of the End Times
And when Jesus was at the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"
He replied to them, Jesus said: "Answer them so that no one may deceive you!"
There were many people in Gafsa, and they took my name and said: I am the Messiah! And many people believed them.
And you are tired of the war and the news of war, and you are fed up with it! All of this must happen, but this will not be the end of time.
And nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be famines, and earthquakes, in divers places.
But all of that is not the cause of the pain.
The clock rooster will welcome you to those who will count you and kill you. And all the people of the world will hate you for the name I bear. When
The rooster of the hour has many people not returning to their faith, selling their principles, and betraying their principles.
They lied a lot about the lying prophets and they slandered a lot of people.
And from the multitude of sins, love is preserved by many people.
But what remains unchanged even to the end is that Ginga. When
"And I will tell her the good news of the kingdom of God in all the world, and it will be a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." The great tribulation
"and you will see in the holy place the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel - let the reader understand!"
The rooster in the clock in the Jewish country flees to the mountains.
And what's on the surface doesn't go down to get what's inside. Luke
The one who was in the field won't come back just to take his clothes.
Woe unto the pregnant women and those who suckle children in those days.
Be careful not to let your escape be in the winter or on Saturday night.
A calamity of such magnitude has never been seen since the time God created the world, not even by a beast, and it will never happen again. The vision
And though God has not shortened these days for everyone, He has shortened them for those whom He has chosen.
The rooster crowed, but no one paid attention: Here is the Messiah, and no one sees him! Don't you believe it,

Chapter Twenty-Six: The Jews of Kechaueru Conspire to Kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he said to his disciples:
"As you know, Easter will now be two days, and the human child will be given to the people so that he may be crucified."
A delegation gathered the heads of the religious leaders and the elders of the people at the house of Caiaphas, the chief priest,
And they took counsel together that they might put Jesus to death by stratagem.
But ݣالو said: "We don't want any of that during the holiday, so that chaos doesn't break out among the people." The woman who had the scent on Jesus
And Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany,
Near her was a woman who had a very precious perfume. She poured it on his head as he was sitting at the table.
The students saw what happened, they didn't like the situation and said: "Why this waste?"
"While this scent could be sold for a high price, and its price is distributed among the poor."
And when Jesus had departed thence, two blind men followed him, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David."
You always have the poor with you, but I will not always be with you.
She is the one who has been waiting for me with this scent on her data, waiting for me to find her in the depths.
"Behold, I tell you the truth: When they have proclaimed this good news of the kingdom in the whole world, then the end will come. This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. Then the betrayer, Judas, agreed to hand over Jesus."
At the time, one of the disciples, a traitor named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
He said to them, "What do you give me if I hand him over to you?" And they agreed with him for thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas Iscariot sought an opportunity to betray Jesus. The evening of the Passover meal with the disciples.
And on the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
And they replied: "Go to the city to so-and-so and tell him: 'Our master says: The hour is near, and I am coming to spend the Eid with you, me and my students.'"
And the disciples asked him, saying, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal?"
And when it was evening, Jesus sat down with the twelve disciples.
They said to Him while they were eating: "We swear to you: none of us will betray you."
The students were very sad, and each of them began to say: "What will become of me, my Lord?"
He answers them and says: "Whoever is with me with his hand in the pocket, that one will betray me!"
The way of the Son of Man is written as it is in the Book of God, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been good for him if he had not been born.”
He is the one whom Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, was about to betray. They asked him, "Rabbi, is it I?" Jesus replied, "You have said so." The Lord's Supper
And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread, gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take and eat, this is my body."
Drink from it, all of you.
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that will be shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
I promise you: From today, we will not drink this grape juice again until the day we drink it with you anew in the kingdom of Po.
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, 'I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
And Jesus said to them, "Tonight you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
"But after we have escaped from death, we will go before you to Galilee." Matthew
Peter replied and said to him: "Everyone complains about you, but I have never complained about you!"
Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter's reply: "Even if we have to die with you, we will never disown you!" And that's what all the disciples said. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane.
A delegation of time came with Jesus and his disciples to a garden named Gethsemane, and said to them: "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And after that, he was with Peter and the sons of Zebedee, James and John. He began to be sorrowful and troubled.
He says to them: "My soul is deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me!"
And may they come upon me a little and prostrate, and he began to pray and say: "O Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from me, but not as I will, but as You will."
He then returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Don't let the experience break you, the spirit is strong but the flesh is weak."
He walked for the second time and prayed, saying: "Oh Father! It was not possible for this trial to be far from us without us reaching it, it is only as You will."
He returned and found them sleeping, as sleep had overcome them.
He left them and walked away again, then prayed for the third time and repeated the same words.
After that, he went to the students and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and resting! Here comes the hour when the son of man will be handed over to the hands of the wicked."
Hello! Here's the one who saved me coming». Jesus is calling
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
The man who handed it over had been given it by someone with a mark, who said to them: "The man who is bald is the one, grab him!"
And behold, there was a man named Judas, who met him, and said, "Hail, Master!" And he kissed him.
He said to Jesus, "Why have you come here, Teacher?" And they drew near to Jesus and seized Him.
And one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, striking the servant of the high priest and cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place! For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
I can't even imagine how we could have endured all those years without the help of more than fifteen battalions of the angelic soldiers?
But how can we achieve the words that are in the book of God and that say that this is something special that should be?
"Here is what Jesus said to the crowds: 'Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.'" Luke
But all this happened so that what the prophets wrote would come true. At that time all the disciples left Jesus and ran away. Jesus was taken to the Jewish leaders.
But those who had arrested Jesus led Him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
And Peter followed him from afar, right into the high priest's house. He sat with the servants to see the outcome.
They were the chief priests and the elders of the people, assembling in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and they plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But he did not find them, and there was a lot of false testimony. And later, they presented Google's testimony.
They say: "This man said: 'I can rebuild the house of God,' and he began to build it." John
He was addressing the chief priests and elders of the people: "Why do you not answer Me at least one of these things that they testify against you, these men?"
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, “I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!”
Jesus replied: "I tell you the truth! The Son of Man is going to come with great power and glory, and on the clouds of heaven!"
The rooster's hour is the need of the head of the clergy, and he said: "This is the path of disbelief! We no longer have anything to fear from the witnesses, have you not heard the words of disbelief from him."
"Eva Asch ban likum?" They replied, "He deserves death!"
They spat on his face and hit him, and two of them slapped him.
وݣالو: "Tell us, then, about the Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter began to speak about Jesus.
Peter was on his own, sitting outside. The servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee!"
I denied in front of everyone present and said: "I don't know how to ride a bike!"
After that, he went to the entrance of the house and saw another servant girl, and they said to her what they were saying: "You too were with Jesus of Nazareth!"
I deny it again and swore: "I don't know this man!"
"After a while, those who were standing came to Peter and said, 'Surely one of us must be his follower, since he wrote about you from his presence!'"
Kilayn began to shout and swear: "I don't know this man!" And at that moment, the rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
Good morning, Brethren, the chief priests and the elders and all the people agreed that Jesus should be put to death.
And they took him and handed him over to the governor Pilate. Judas Iscariot hanged himself.
Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, and repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, the deeds.
He told them: "I saw him when I delivered a message to someone who had no fault." He told him: "It's not our business, mind your own affairs."
And Judas threw the silver piece into the house of God, and then went and hanged himself.
And the heads of the religious men took the silver and said: "It is lawful for us to put it into the treasury of the house of God."
They agreed to buy the Fakhari plot of land with it and turn it into a nursery for the Berberians.
And on Dakshi, the people of this village still call it the "Blood Feddan" to this day.
And the cock that is on the hour will accomplish exactly what the Lord told the prophet Jeremiah: "Take these thirty pieces of silver, the handsome price at which they valued Me, and which the children of Israel priced Me at,"
"And with this, he handed him over to you, Pilate the governor. Jesus stood before the governor."
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
And even if the heads of the religious leaders and the elders were to summon him, he would not respond to them unless he needed to.
And Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
And Jesus gave no answer, not even a single word, and the governor was greatly amazed.
It was the custom of the governor that every Easter he would release one of the prisoners that the people disliked.
And they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas, who was in custody with them.
For it was the governor's custom at the feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
While Pilate knew that it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
And when Pilate was in the seat of judgment, his wife sent unto him, saying, "Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
Pilate asked them, "Who is it you want me to release to you?" They answered, "Barabbas."
He said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
And they said to Him, "What evil has He done?" But they kept insisting, "Crucify Him!"
And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; you bear the responsibility!"
He answered the whole people and said: "May his blood not be on us and on our children!"
And they released unto them him that for rebellion and murder was cast into prison, whom they desired; but they asked that Jesus should be crucified. When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's palace and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
وعراوه ولبسوه سلهام حمر،
They placed a crown of thorns on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying: "Greetings, King of the Jews!"
And they threw him down and took the pole and hit him on the head with it.
And after they had laughed at him, they took the scepter away from him, put his sandals on him, and crucified him. Jesus was crucified.
When they were leaving the city, they met a man from Kairouan named Simon, and they asked him to carry Jesus' cross.
They reached the place I called Al-Jalajita, which means the skull's place.
They gave him a drink of wine mixed with a herb called "mar," and it was so strong that he couldn't refuse to drink it.
They crucified him and divided his clothes by casting lots after they had struck him with a reed.
وبقاو ݣالسين تم عساسين عليه،
And above his head, there was an inscription on the cross: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
A rooster is standing with Google Glass, one on his left and another on his right.
They were the people who used to race their horses.
"Wakilulu: 'Whoever destroys the house of God and tries to rebuild it in three days, let your head fall off unless you are the son of God and descended from the cross!'" When
They were the heads of the religious scholars, the scholars of Islamic law, and the elders, to the point that they would laugh at him and say:
People were saved, but he couldn't save his own head! Unless he was the King of Israel, descending on a horse from the cross and they believed in him!
Damn him for blaspheming! He will not be forgiven unless he repents, for he said: "I am the son of God!".
Even the demons that came with him were treated differently. The death of Jesus
The darkness spread across the entire country from the heat of the day until the third hour of the night.
"About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'"
They heard one of those standing nearby say: "He is weeping for Elijah."
One of them was stabbed and his liver was cut open, causing him to drown in his own blood and die instantly.
They were saying to me, "Let's wait and see what's going to happen, maybe Elija will save him!"
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
The raw materials of the House of God are on Google, from top to bottom. And the earth quakes and the rocks split.
And they sweetened the graves and followed them with many of the saints from death,
And they came out from the tombs after following Jesus from death, and entered into Jerusalem the holy city, and many people gathered.
And when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were very afraid and said, "Truly this was the Son of God."
And many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from a distance. Luke
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus' burial.
And in the evening, a man came, wearing a robe from Rama, named Joseph. He was a disciple of Jesus.
And the man entered and approached Pilate, asking him to give him the data of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
And God took Joseph's body and wrapped it in pure linen.
And he placed it in the new tomb that he had hewn in the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. It was early in the morning.
And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate.
Why did you say: "If that liar were alive, he would have said that after three days he would return." When?
Eva gave you this task so that you would be on the grave until the third day, so that the students don't go at night and steal him and say to the people: "He followed death!" And this lie will be the last one, worse than the first."
He said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how."
And they rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and sat there.
Chapter Twenty-Two Jesus Rises from the Dead
On the first day of the week, at dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His appearance was dark as lightning and his clothes were white as snow.
And they tremble with great fear, and they are not like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified,"
Our path begins here, where it all started from death. Let's go see the place it was kept.
"Cyrus took the pot and said to his disciples, 'He is one of those who will die, and you will not precede him to the Ghaul, but where will you find him? This is your test.' "
The girls came out of the grave confused, both scared and very happy, and started running to tell the news to their friends.
He met with them by surprise and said to them: "Peace be with you!" And they rejoiced when they saw him, and worshiped him.
And Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The disciples did as they were told.
They were still children when they left, walking two by two from the village to the city and informing the heads of the religious men about what had happened there.
Gather with the elders and consult them, and bribe the army with a lot of money.
قالو ليهم: «قالو بلي التلامد دياله جاو فالليل سرقوه وحنا ناعسين،»
Otherwise, the governor will bring the news. We will convince him, and nothing will go wrong for you.
And God provided the money and showed them how, and this news spread among the Jews until this day. Jesus instructed his disciples.
But the disciples, seeing the wind, were very much afraid, and began to sink. And they cried out, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
And they did not prostrate to him, but two of them prostrated.
And when Jesus came near, He spoke to them, saying: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me,"

And he saw Simon Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
And Jesus, when he came out, saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

And Jesus got up and rebuked the demon, saying to it, "Be silent and come out of the man!"

When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
The people of the city used to gather at the door.
Jesus healed many who had various diseases; he drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. Jesus taught
And Jesus arose a great while before day, and went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
And began Simon and those who were with him to draw the net aboard,
And they said to him: "The people's way is to turn against you!"
And Jesus said to them, "Let us go to the nearby towns so that we may preach there also, for that is why I have come."
And he went about preaching the gospel in their synagogues, and casting out devils throughout all the land of Galilee. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus healed a man who was sick
And behold, a man came to Jesus, a leper, and knelt before Him and begged Him, saying: "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
He scolded him, reached out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want, I want to be pure!"
The rooster strays from the clock and Wali Tahr.
And Jesus strictly charged him and sent him away at once, and said to him:
"Don't worry, you won't say anything to anyone! But go and show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
But that man went out and began to tell everyone what had happened to him, and this news spread. As a result, Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but had to stay outside in lonely places. Yet people came to him from everywhere.
Chapter Two: Jesus Heals a Paralytic
After the death of John, Jesus returned to Galilee and the news about Him spread throughout the region.
They gathered a great multitude, so that there was no longer room even at the door. And He began to teach them the word of God.
The man who is paralyzed is the treasure of the men.
They couldn't bring him closer due to the crowd, so they went up onto the roof above the place where he was lying. They made an opening and lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you!"
They were scholars of Islamic law, and they had in their minds:
"For what reason does this man speak like this, and say blasphemous words? Who can forgive sins except God alone?"
And immediately, Jesus, knowing their thoughts in the Spirit, said to them, "Why do you have these thoughts in your hearts?"
But it is easy for the lame: Forgiven are your sins, and he is not asked: Did you shake your bed and walk?
«But know that every human being has the power on earth to forgive sins». And to the paralytic:
"Lick the pillow: Shake out your bed, and sweep your room!"
And the man stood up and shook off his cloak and went out before the people. And they were all amazed and gave glory to God and said: "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus then chose Matthew.
And Jesus returned again beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great crowd gathered to Him, and He began to teach them.
A man named Luwai, who was about 12 years old, was walking in the tax office when he saw a man who said to him, "Follow me." So he followed him.
And it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in Levi's house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many who followed Him.
And when the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
He heard them and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The question about fasting
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to Jesus, "Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.”
But the time will come when the groom is taken from among them, and that day is near.
Even if you patch an old garment with a piece of new cloth, the new patch will be torn away, and the tear will be made worse.
And he went on until one who was not able to drink the new wine, so the skins in front burst, and when this new wine wants to take the skins, the wine spills and the skins are lost. But the new wine must be put into new skins. Jesus taught on the Sabbath.
Shabbat, the day of rest and worship for Jews, begins at 2:23 PM on Saturday.
And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why do Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?" Then Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
Jesus answered them, “Have you never read how David, when he was hungry, and those with him entered the house of God, and ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?”
"And how did he enter the House of God, when he was not even the head of the religious men, and the bread that was offered to God, which no one else could eat except the religious men alone, and he even gave some of it to the men who were with him?"
They said to them: "Saturday is for us, not for those who work on Saturday."
"Where man is born is the Lord, even on the Sabbath."
Chapter Three Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
And Jesus entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
And the Pharisees were watching Jesus to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.
And Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise up and stand in the midst!"
And he said to the Pharisees: "What is lawful to do on the Sabbath— to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
Harmful and healing in them, and he was very angry, and he was very sad about the hardness of their hearts, and he said to the man: "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched out his hand and it became whole.
The chief priests and the Pharisees had gathered the Sanhedrin and said, "What are we accomplishing? Here is this man performing many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
Jesus went out with his disciples to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed them.
And from Jerusalem and Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people came to Jesus, having heard what he was doing.
Students, please make sure there is enough space for everyone so that people don't crowd around. Mark.
Many of them recovered, to the point that the sick began to fight each other to touch him.
And those who were possessed by demons were coming to Him and falling down before Him and crying out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus called them and said to them, "Do not let anyone say that you are him. Jesus chose the disciples."
And he went up to one of the mountains and cried out to the men he had chosen, and they came to him.
And he chose twelve whom he called apostles, to be with him and to proclaim the good news.
They have the power to unleash chaos.
And these are the names of the Twelve: Simon, whom Jesus named Peter,
James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, whom Jesus surnamed Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder.
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,
Judas Iscariot, who is going to betray Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebub.
