The greatest in the kingdom of heaven
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them
He said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
For whoever makes himself as low as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Whosoever receiveth one such little child in my name receiveth me.
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea.
Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!
If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be cast into the hellfire. Like the lost sheep.
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father in heaven."
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the stray one?
And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one than about the ninety-nine who did not go astray.
Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
"And if your brother wrongs you, go and rebuke him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
And if he will not hear, take also with you one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
And if they do not hear them, say it to the church. And if they do not hear the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
"Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
And I say to you also: If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." Like a servant who does not forgive
At that time Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him: "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began in accounting, a debtor came to him owing ten thousand talents.
And when he had nothing to pay his master's debt, he, his wife, his children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay the debt.
Pride of the servant and prostrated to him saying: "O my lord, give me respite, and I will fulfill all of it."
He opened the slave's shackles, set him free, and left him his religion.
And when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and he seized him and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay what you owe.'
Pride accompanied the slave on his feet and said to him: Wait for me and I will fulfill all your needs.
He did not respond but instead went ahead and threw him into prison until he paid the debt.
When the slaves' companions saw what had happened, they were deeply saddened. They came and told their master everything that had occurred.
"At that time, his master summoned him and said to him: 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me to.'"
And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?
And his mistress was angry and handed him over to the torturers until he paid all that he owed her.
"Thus your heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not forgive from your hearts every one his brother's offenses."
Marriage and divorce
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan.
And large crowds followed him there, and he healed them.
And Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
And he answered and said to them, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?”
He said: "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
"Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What God has joined together, let no one separate."
They said to him: "Then why did Moses command that a certificate of divorce be given and she be divorced?"
He said to them: "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not so."
"And I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of a man with a woman, it is better not to marry!"
He said to them: "Not everyone accepts this word, but those to whom it is given,"
For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.» Jesus blessed the children
Then the little children were brought to Him, that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
He placed his hands on them and went from there. The rich young man.
"Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?" And someone came to him and said, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
He said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, that is God. But if you would enter life, keep the commandments."
He said to him, "Which commandments?" Jesus said, "Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself."
The young man said to him: "I have memorized all of this since my childhood. What else do I need after this?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he had great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
"And I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God!"
When His disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
And Peter answered and said to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?”
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man will be seated on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for the sake of my name, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
But many are first who will be last, and last who will be first.
Like the generous in generosity
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was a landowner went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
Agreed with the workers for a dinar a day, and sent them to his generosity.
Then he went out around three o'clock and saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them: "You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you." So they went.
He also went out around 6:00 and 9:00 and did the same.
Then, around eleven o'clock, he went out and found others standing idle. He said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day idle?"
They said to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive."
When evening came, the generous host said to his agent: "Dismiss the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones and ending with the first."
And the men of the eleventh hour came and took a dinar, a dinar.
When the first ones came, they thought they would take more. So they also took one dinar at a time.
They complained to the lord of the house as they were taking it.
Saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day!'
He replied, saying to one of them: "My friend, I have not wronged you! Did we not agree on a dinar?"
Take what you have and go, for I wish to give this last one to someone like you.
Or what is it to you what I do with my own? Or is your eye evil because I am good?
"Thus the last will be first, and the first will be last, for many are called but few are chosen." Jesus prophesies about his death and resurrection
"As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves on the road and said to them:"
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,"
"and they will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify him, and he will rise on the third day." The mother of the sons of Zebedee asked
Then, the mother of Zabdi's sons came to him with her sons, bowed down, and asked him for something.
He said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom."
Jesus answered, "You don't know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I am going to drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" "We can," they answered.
And He said to them, "You will drink My cup, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized. But to sit at My right hand and at My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."
When the ten heard this, they were indignant about the two brothers.
And Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them."
Let it not be so among you. But whoever would among you be great, let him be your servant.
And whoever among you would be first, let him be your slave,
"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of two blind men in Jericho
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him,
And two blind men sitting by the way. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
Rebuke them, they kept silent, but they cried out all the more, saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him: "Lord, let our eyes be opened!"
And Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed Him.
Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples
Saying to them: "Go to the village that is before you; there you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here."
And if anyone says anything to you, say: "The Lord needs them." At once he will send them.
It was all so that what was said by the prophet might be fulfilled:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, gentle, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
The two disciples went and entered the city, just as Jesus had directed them.
And they brought the elephant and the donkey, and put their clothes on them, so he sat on them.
And most of them spread their garments on the road. And others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when He entered Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, "Who is this?"
And the crowd said, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee." Cleansing of the Temple
And Jesus entered the temple of God and cast out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
He said to them: "It is written: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' But you have made it a 'den of robbers.'"
And he presented him to his uncle, who was lame in the structure, and he healed them.
When the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.
And they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and stayed there. The fig tree withered.
In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' it will happen.
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believers, you will receive." The question about the power of Jesus
And when He came to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, saying, "By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "I also will ask you a question, and if you tell it to me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things:"
"John's baptism: where was it from? From heaven or from people?" They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
And if we say: "From among the people," we fear the populace, for John is a prophet to all.
And they answered Jesus, saying: "We do not know." He also said to them: "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do this. The parable of the two sons."
What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go work in my vineyard today."
He replied, "I don't want it." But he eventually regretted it and left.
And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, Here am I, my lord. And he went not away.
"Which of the two did the will of the father?" They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you."
For John came to you in the way of truth, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And you, when you saw it, did not afterward repent to believe him. The parable of the vinedressers
Listen to another example: A man, the owner of a house, planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyard to collect his fruit.
And so the magnanimous took their slaves, flogged some, killed some, and stoned some.
Then he also sent other servants, more than the first, and they did the same to them.
Finally, he sent them his son, saying: "They will respect my son!"
And when the nobles saw the son, they said among themselves: "This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance!"
And they took him out of the vineyard and killed him.
When will the generous one come, what will he do to those generous ones?
They said to him: "Those idle servants will be utterly destroyed, and the honor will be given to other servants who will give the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
"Whoever falls on this stone will be broken, and whoever it falls on will be crushed!"
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking about them.
And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
A wedding like the king's son
And Jesus also spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son,
And he sent his servants to invite the guests to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
And he also sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast!"'
But they were negligent and went away, one to his field, another to his business.
And the rest seized their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
When the king heard, he was angry, and he sent his soldiers and killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servant: "As for the wedding feast, it is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy."
Go to the crossroads, and invite everyone you find to the wedding.
And those servants went out into the streets, and gathered all those they found, both wicked and good. So the wedding was filled with guests.
When the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who was not wearing the wedding garment.
He said to him: "Friend, how did you get in here without the wedding garment?" And he was silent.
Then the king said to the servants, "Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"For many are called, but few are chosen." Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle him in his words.
So they sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians, saying: "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not show partiality to anyone, for you do not look at the outward appearance of people."
"Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the poll-tax to Caesar or not?"
And Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
"Show me the poll tax record." They brought him a dinar.
He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
They said to Him, "Caesar's." And He said to them, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished and left him. The question about the resurrection of the dead.
On that day, some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and questioned him.
Saying: "O teacher, Moses said: If a man dies and has no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise offspring for his brother."
We had seven brothers. The first one married and died. Since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second, third, up to the seventh.
Last of all, the woman also dies.
"At the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven? For she was wife to all of them!"
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, who said:
"Am I not the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The Greatest Commandment
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together,
"One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him:" (Translation of the Arabic text into English)
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
"These two commandments sum up the entire law and the prophets." Christ and David
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
Saying: "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "How then does David call him 'Lord' in the Spirit, saying:"
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."
"If David called him Lord, how is he his son?"
No one could answer him. And from that day, no one dared to ask him anything.
Beware of the scribes and the Pharisees
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples
Saying: "On Moses' seat sit the scribes and the Pharisees,"
All that they told you to memorize, memorize it and do it, but do not act according to their deeds, for they say and do not do.
They load people with burdens [difficult to bear] and will not move them with a finger.
All their works they do to be seen by people: they widen their phylacteries and enlarge the tassels of their garments.
They love the first seats at feasts and the front rows in assemblies.
Greetings in the markets, and people call out to them: "My lord, my lord!"
But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
Do not call anyone your teacher, for you have one teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you should be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to."
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe unto you, blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
O ye fools and blind! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
And whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by it.
O ye fools and blind! Whether is greater: the sacrifice, or the altar which sanctifieth the sacrifice?
Verily, those who swear by the altar, swear by it and by all that is on it!
And whoever swears by the Ka'bah has sworn by it and by those who dwell therein.
And whoever swears by the heavens has sworn by the Throne of Allah and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
O ye blind guides! who strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
O hypocrite! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
Thus you also: outwardly you appear to people as righteous, but within you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say: "If we were in the days of our fathers, we would have participated with them in the blood of the prophets."
You bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Fill ye up the measure of your fathers.
You serpents' children! How will you escape the damnation of Hell?
Therefore, I am sending you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them by crucifixion, and others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.
that all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!"
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
"For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
Signs of the End Times
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them: "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another that will not be torn down!"
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
And Jesus answered and said to them: "Behold! Let no one lead you astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will lead many astray.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled. For all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
But these are all the beginning of sorrows.
At that time they will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
Then many will betray one another and hate one another.
And many false prophets arise and lead many astray.
For the abundance of sin, the love of many grows cold.
But he who endures to the end, he will be saved.
Behold, the kingdom's good news is proclaimed throughout the universe, a testimony to all nations. Then comes the end.
When did you see "the abomination of desolation" that the prophet Daniel spoke of, standing in the holy place - to understand the reader -
And then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
And he who is on the surface does not descend to take anything from his house,
And he who is in the field, let him not turn back to take his cloak.
Woe to the pregnant and those who give suck in those days!
Arrived so that your escape is not in winter nor on Saturday.
For at that time there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
But if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved. However, for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There!' do not believe it.
For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Here I am, I have preceded and informed you.
If they say to you, "Behold, he is in the desert," do not go out; "Behold, he is in the inner rooms," do not believe it.
For just as lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Where there's a body, there you will find vultures.
And immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
And He shall send His angels with a mighty trumpet blast, and they shall gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
From the fig tree learn the parable: when its branches become tender and it puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.
Thus you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near at the doors.
Verily I say unto you: This generation shall not pass away until all these things are accomplished.
The heavens and the earth will perish, but my word will not perish. Eternal readiness.
"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also at the coming of the Son of Man.
For just as people did in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
And they did not know until the flood came and took them all away. So will also be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then there will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two are grinding at the mill; one is taken and the other is left.
"Be on the alert then, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming."
And know this: if the Lord of the house knew in which hour the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not let his house be broken into.
Therefore, you also be ready, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man is coming. Like the faithful servant.
Who is the trustworthy, wise servant whom his master has put in charge of the servants to give them food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he comes!
I tell you the truth: He puts it all on the line.
But if that wicked servant says in his heart, 'My master is delaying his coming,'
He begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunkards.
The Lord of that Day will come on a day they do not expect, at an hour they do not know.
He divides it and makes his share with the women. There is weeping and gnashing of teeth.
The Ten Virgins
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
There were five of them who were wise, and five who were foolish.
But the foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them,
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
In the meantime, the groom slowed down, and we all cheered for them and blessed them.
In the middle of the night, there was a shout: Behold, the bridegroom is coming, so go out to meet him!
All those young women stood up and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish ones said to the wise ones: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
The wise women replied, saying: "Perhaps it is not enough for us, but let us go to the merchants and buy some."
As they were leaving to prepare, the groom arrived, and the bridesmaids entered with him into the wedding, and the door was shut.
At last, the rest of the maidens also came, saying: "O lord, O lord, open to us!"
He answered and said: Truly I say to you: I do not know you.
Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour when the Son of Man is coming. For the parable
It was as if a traveling man called his servants and entrusted them with his money,
He gave one five measures, another two, and another one. Each according to his ability. And he departed at that time.
A man took five weights and traded with them, thus gaining another five weights.
Thus, the one who took the two weights, also won two more weights.
And he who took the weight went and dug in the earth and hid his master's silver.
After a long time, the master of those slaves came and held them accountable.
And he who took the five weights came and brought five other weights, saying: "O master, you gave me five weights. Here are five other weights that I earned on top of them."
He said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came the one who had received the two talents, and said, 'Lord, two talents you delivered to me; see, I have gained two other talents besides them.'
He said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came also he that had received the one talent, saying, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed.
Fear came, and I went and hid your weight in the earth. Behold, this is for you.
"Then his lord answered and said to him, 'You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter,'"
It was supposed to be that you put my money with the moneychanger, so when I came, I would take what is mine with interest.
Take from him a weight and give it to the one who has ten weights.
For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
The servant of the idol cast him into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the goats.
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne."
All nations gather before Him, and He distinguishes some from others, just as a shepherd distinguishes his sheep from his goats,
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Because I was hungry, you gave me something to eat. Because I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
You visited me when I was naked. You visited me when I was sick. You came to me when I was in prison.
"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?'"
When did we ever see you as a stranger and give you shelter, or naked and clothe you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'"
"Then He will also say to those on the left, 'Depart from Me, you accursed, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels,'"
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. I was thirsty, you did not give me drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not take me in. I was naked, and you did not clothe me. I was sick and imprisoned, and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not serve you?’
"Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
"These shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
The conspiracy to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples:
"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
At that time the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people gathered in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
And they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and put Him to death.
But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people." Then they poured the ointment on Jesus.
While Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,
A woman approached him with an expensive bottle of perfume and poured it on his head as he reclined.
When His disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
"For it could have been sold for much and given to the poor."
And Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work on me.”
For the poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me with you.
She did this because she wanted to anoint my body for burial.
"Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be spoken of in memory of her." Judas' betrayal
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
He said: "What do you want to give me if I deliver him to you?" So they set for him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver it. The Last Supper with the disciples
In the first days of the Feast, the disciples came to Jesus and said to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
He said: "Go to the city, to So-and-so, and tell him: The teacher says: My time is near. With you, I will speak eloquently with my disciples."
And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them; they prepared the Passover.
When evening came, he reclined at the table with the twelve.
And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."
And they were very sorrowful, and each one of them began to say to Him, "Lord, is it I?"
And he answered and said: "He who dips his hand with me in the dish is he who betrays me!"
"For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. Truly I tell you, some who are here standing with us will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
And Judas answered, "Is it I, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You have said." The Lord's Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying: "Take, eat. This is my body."
Take this cup, give thanks, and give it to them, saying: "Drink from it, all of you,"
For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
"And I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine from this moment until the day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
Then they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial of him.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, 'I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.'"
"But after I have risen, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter answered him, "Even if everyone doubts you, I never will."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same. In Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Then he took with him Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
He said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."
Then he went a little further and fell on his face, and he prayed, saying: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as You will."
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour?"
Take heed, stand firm, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And he went away again the second time and prayed, saying, «O my Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass away from me unless I drink it, your will be done».
Then he came and found them also sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them and went away, and prayed the third time, saying that very word.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Sleep now and rest! Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Arise, let us be going! Behold, he who betrays me is at hand!". The arrest of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he who delivered him gave them a sign, saying: "He whom I shall point to, is he. Seize him."
At that time, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David!"
And Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
And one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the chief priest and cut off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword!"
Do you think I cannot now ask my Father, and He will give me more than twelve legions of angels?
How then should the books be completed: "Is this how it should be?"
In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds: "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me."
And all this has happened to fulfill the words of the prophets. Then all the disciples left Him and fled. Before the Sanhedrin
And those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
But Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and the elders and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,
They found no evidence. Despite many false witnesses, they found no evidence. But finally, a false witness came forward.
They said: "This is what he said: 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'"
And the high priest said to Him, "Do You not answer anything? What is it these men testify against You?"
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, "I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"
Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
And the high priest tore his clothes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy!"
What do you think?” They answered and said, “He deserves death.”
Then they spat in his face and struck him; and others slapped him
Saying, "Christ, tell us who struck You." Peter's denial
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee!"
He denied it in front of everyone, saying: "I don't know what you're talking about!"
Then, when he went out to the porch, another saw him and said to those there, "This one was with Jesus the Nazarene!"
He also denied under oath: "I do not know the man!"
After a little while, the bystanders came and said to Peter, "Surely you also are one of them, for your accent betrays you!"
He then began to curse and swear: "I do not know the man!" And at that moment, the rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which He had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." So he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself
And when it was morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death,
And they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
Saying: "I may have erred in shedding innocent blood." They replied: "What is that to us? You decide!"
He threw the silver into the temple and left, then went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
Consult and buy the Al-Fakhari field, a cemetery for strangers.
For this, that field was named "The Field of Blood" to this day.
Then it was fulfilled which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was priced by the children of Israel,"
"Give it to her from the field of Pharisees, as the Lord commanded me." Before Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You say so."
While the chief priests and the elders were accusing him, he did not answer.
He said to him Pilate: "Do you not hear how they testify against you?"
He did not answer even a single word, so the prince was very surprised.
It was the governor's custom to release one prisoner to the public on the holiday, whoever they wished.
They had at that time a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
For they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Because they knew he had been handed over out of envy.
And as he sat on the throne, his wife sent him a message saying: "Beware of that bear, for I have suffered greatly in a dream because of it."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
And the governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas."
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let Him be crucified!"
And the governor said, "What evil has he done?" But they were the more fierce, crying, "Let him be crucified."
When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. Look to yourselves!"
And all the people answered and said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then they released Barabbas to them. But Jesus, after being scourged, was handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Him.
So the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's residence and assembled the entire cohort around him.
His hair was disheveled, and they dressed him in a crimson robe,
And when they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they spat on him, took the reed and struck him on the head.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him. The crucifixion.
And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
When they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull."
Give him a cup mixed with bitterness to drink. And when he tasted it, he did not want to drink.
And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: "They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots."
Then they sat down to guard him there.
And above his head they put the charge against him in writing: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
At that time, two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
They would pass by him, shaking their heads.
Saying, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
And the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said:
"Deliver others, but he cannot deliver himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!"
Trust in God, let Him save him now if He wills! For he said: "I am the son of God!".
Thus, even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him. Death
From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
"About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'"
And some of those standing there, when they heard it, said, "It is Elijah."
And one of them ran at that moment, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
But the rest said, "Let him be. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him!"
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.
The tombs opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised.
And they came out of the tombs after his resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
But the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, and they were greatly afraid, and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
There were also many women looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,
Between them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. the burial
When evening came, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus,
Then he came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate commanded the body to be given.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,
And placed him in his new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock, then rolled a large stone onto the tomb's entrance and left.
There were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb
In the next day, after preparing, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate
Saying: "O Lord, you have reminded us that the deceiver said while he was alive: 'After three days I will rise.'"
"Then he commanded that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and that this last deception be worse than the first!'"
And Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how."
They proceeded and secured the tomb with guards, and sealed the stone.
The Resurrection
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
And if a great earthquake happened, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
The guards trembled in fear and became like the dead.
The angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here; he has risen, just as he said! Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
"Go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Look, I have told you."
And they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.
And behold, they went to tell his disciples, and behold, Jesus met them and said, "Peace be with you." And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The words of the guards
And as they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all that had happened.
Gather with the elders, consult, and give the army much silver.
Saying: "They say, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'"
"if you hear of that at the valley, we will implore him, and make you feel secure."
So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. This saying has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appeared to the disciples.
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated themselves, but some of them doubted.
And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth,"
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Amen.
John the Baptist prepares the way
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send My Angel before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You."
A loud voice in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the people of Jerusalem and Judea went out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
And John wore camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He was preaching, saying: "After me comes one who is stronger than me, of whom I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandal."
"Then I baptize you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The baptism and temptation of Jesus Christ
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And at that moment, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.
And a voice came from heaven: "You are my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
And at that moment, the spirit was sent to the wilderness.
And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. The calling of the first disciples
After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.
He says: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people."
They always left their windows open and followed him.
Then He went a little farther from there, and He saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in the boat mending their nets.
He called them to the time. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workers and followed Him. A demon-possessed man
Then they entered Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were amazed by his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
There was a man in their assembly who had an evil spirit, and he cried out
Saying: "Ah! What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!"
"Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be quiet! Come out of him!'"
And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
They were all amazed and asked each other, "What is this? What is this new teaching? He commands even the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey him!"
And his fame went out into all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
And when they came out of the assembly, they came home to Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law was lying down with a fever; and immediately they told Him about her.
She took it and set it up with her hands, so the fever left her immediately and she began to serve them.
When evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and demon-possessed.
The whole city was gathered at the gate.
Healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and did not allow the demons to speak because they knew Him. Preaching in Galilee
In the early morning, he got up, went out, and proceeded to a secluded place, and he prayed there.
And Simon and those who were with him followed.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
He said to them: "Let us go to the neighboring villages, that I may preach there also, for this is why I came out."
He preached in their synagogues throughout Galilee and drove out demons. He healed those with skin diseases.
And behold, a leper came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
And Jesus, having compassion, stretched out His hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be made clean!"
Whenever he spoke, the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
I forbid you and send you to the time.
He said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
But he went out and began to proclaim it widely and to spread the news, so that he could no longer enter a town openly, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to him from every quarter.
Recovery of a paralyzed person
Then He went into Capernaum again after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house.
And a large crowd gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door. And he was speaking the word to them.
They brought him a paralyzed man carried by four.
And when they could not approach him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."
There were some scribes sitting there, thinking to themselves:
"Why does he speak like this in a deceitful manner? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you think these things in your hearts?
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
"but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic:
"Then I say to you, get up and pick up your mat and go to your house!"
He got up, took the mat and went out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Then he called Levi.
Then He also went out to the sea. And all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.
And as he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him.
And while He was reclining in the house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and His disciples, for there were many who followed Him.
And when the scribes and the Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, "How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The question about fasting
And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But there will come days when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on those days.
No one sews a patch from new cloth onto an old garment, otherwise the new patch takes from the old and the tear becomes worse.
"No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into new wineskins." Lord of the Sabbath
And he went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples began to pluck heads of grain as they went.
The Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were in need and hungry?"
"how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave to those who were with him."
Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath also."
Recovery by Saturday
Then he went into the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
They watched him: Would he heal on the Sabbath? So that they might accuse him.
He said to the man with the dry hand: "Stand in the middle!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" And they were silent.
He looked around at them angrily and sorrowfully at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored, healthy like the other one.
The Pharisees went out and immediately began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Him. Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed Him.
Jesus departed with His disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee and from Judea followed Him.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
He told his disciples to keep a small boat with him for the sake of gathering, so that they would not crowd him.
For he had healed many, so that all who had afflictions pressed around him to touch him.
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
And he strongly advised them not to display it. The selection of the twelve apostles.
Then he went up the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
And he appointed twelve to be with him, and to send them out to preach
And they will have power to heal diseases and cast out demons.
He gave Simon the name Peter.
James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, and he gave them the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder.
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Then they came to the house of Jesus and Beelzebul
They also gathered together until they could not even afford bread.
And when his relatives heard of it, they went out to seize him, for they said, "He is out of his mind!"
But the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and "It is by the ruler of the demons that he casts out the demons."
And He said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
