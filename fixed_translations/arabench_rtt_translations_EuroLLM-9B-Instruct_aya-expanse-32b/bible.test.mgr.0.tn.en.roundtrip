environmental khoa person in the kingdom?
khoa, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoae who humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever corrects an orphan's mistake before mine, it is corrected for me.
Why is it that none of these little ones who believe in me will lead others into sin? If they do, it would be better for them to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.
khoa, if only it were a curse upon the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Such things must come, but a curse upon those who cause them!
"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever."
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Gehenna. The parable of the lost sheep.
"Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones. This is what I tell you. Their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
(No
"Don't you think so? Suppose a man has 100 sheep, and one of them wanders away. Won't he leave the 99 on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?"
What's up, I'm here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
And the same is true of your Father in heaven. He doesn't want to lose any of these little ones. When someone sins against you
"If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him where he has erred. Keep the matter between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
Why doesn't your car listen to you? Next time, take one or two others with you. The Scripture says, "Every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses" (Deuteronomy 19:15).
Why doesn't he listen to the testimony of the witnesses? Tell the church. And why doesn't he even listen to the church? Do not treat him as a brother. Treat him as you would treat an unbeliever or a tax collector.
"What is it? Here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here."
"But, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this, around this,
"Indeed, the people will be gathered together against him, but he will be blind to them." The servant who does not do good.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
Since the king had started doing that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought in.
The man was unable to pay. So his master commanded. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he had were sold to repay his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay it all back."
His mistress felt pity for him. She forgave him and let him go.
"Please, take this key, and let my servant Zeinab go from the prison of Zeinab, the prison of Zeinab, the prison of Zeinab..."
"The other servant fell on his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I will pay you.'"
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the lord called the first servant into the room. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me.
Is it not fitting that you should show mercy to the other servant as I have shown mercy to you?
In anger, his master turned him over to the guards. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
"The sky will split asunder for you all, unless you forgive your brother in your hearts."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
After Jesus had finished speaking, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds were following him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Did you not read that at the beginning God created 'male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
It is not two, but one. Therefore, it is not for man to separate what God has joined.
They said: "How could Moses command a man to divorce his wife by writing her a bill of divorce and then send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you: Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The pupils said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others made themselves that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way can live that way." Little children were brought to Jesus."
Some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Why?" asked the man. Jesus said, " 'Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
'Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all these commandments. What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
The young man, when he heard these words, departed sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished. They asked, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
"It would be fair if we left everything to follow you! What reward will be given to us?"
Jesus said to them, "What I am telling you is true: When everything is made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
"At seven and nine o'clock in the evening, he left the house. He saw others standing in the market around the table, doing nothing."
He said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you."
"He went out again around noon and at three o'clock did the same thing."
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing there. He asked them, 'Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?'
"Because he did not hire us," they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The workers I contracted around 5 o'clock are coming. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
When those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
As soon as they received it, he started complaining about the owner.
They said: 'The people who came this time only worked for one hour,' 'You paid them the same amount we paid. We worked more than them and were under the hot sun all day.'
The companion replied to one of them. "My friend," he said, "I'll be fair with you. Didn't you have an agreement to go and work at the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the ones I mentioned before the same pay I gave you.
Why don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Why do you feel cheated because I started giving generously to others?
"We are very happy for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you."
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the road, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem." "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. The people will mock him and punish him. They will make him be crucified. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" "A mother asks about Jesus' satisfaction."
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She sat at his feet and made a request.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and that the other may sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The tenth pupil heard about it. They became angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know how the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Not like that. Instead, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
"Like the Sabbath for man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many people free from sin." Two Talents Receive the View
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Lord," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. They followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied, with a colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them God needs them. The owner will automatically make them disappear.
And this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet. As it is written.
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you. He is humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The students went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They sent the donkey and the colt. And they laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on them.
A very large group of people spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, others followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind people and disabled people came to Jesus in the temple. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
They said to him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? It says, 'I have placed my trust in you, even with the words of children and infants you have established your cause' (Psalm 8:2)."
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
The bubble saw a fig tree by the roadside. He climbed it but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "Perhaps you will never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus replied, "What I'm telling you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do what they did for the fig tree. You can say to a mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Who was it that baptized John? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They were arguing with each other about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
Why don't we say, "He is a man"? We're afraid of people. Everyone will think John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Well then, I will tell you with authority why I do this. It is like the story of the two sons."
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'"
" 'It's up to him', his son replied. 'He'll have to figure it out for himself and learn.'
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered him, 'I will, sir.' But he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John should set the right way to live. And you are what regulates it. But tax collectors and prostitutes regulate it. You saw it. But even that did not deter you from your sins and regulate it. The story of the tenants.
They heard another story. A man owned a piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He instructed the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
Only the tenants held his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another one. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them in the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
"The homeowners saw the son coming. They said to each other, 'This is the one who will inherit all the owner's possessions one day. Let's kill him. Then everything will be ours.'"
They took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
How will the owner deal with the tenants when he returns from the caravan?
"They will destroy the children of evil." they replied. "Then they will come to lease the vineyard to others, to other tenants. They will not give them their share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22, 23)
"What I tell you is this: the kingdom of God will take it away from you and give it to people who will bear its fruits."
Anyone who falls on the stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they plotted to seize him. But they feared the crowd. People thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them other stories. He said:
"This is how the kingdom of heaven is. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sold his slaves to those who were invited to dinner. The slaves were told to go, but they refused.
"Then he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast."'
People were not indifferent. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest captured his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, 'My wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come.'
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the slaves went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to look at the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend, he said, How did you get in here without your wedding clothes? The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, 'Bind his hands and feet. Cast him outside into the darkness. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.'
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity, teaching the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not show partiality to anyone, and you do not teach with a view to popular opinion."
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes." They brought him a silver coin.
He said to them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's."
Why didn't they believe her? They were astonished. So they left him and departed. Marriage when it raises the dead.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people are raised from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies without children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children to carry on his brother's name."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened until the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven were married to her."
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers allow them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"Why are they standing up for the dead? Haven't you read what Allah has said to you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So Jesus tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "What is the most important matter in the law?"
Jesus replied, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important testament.
The second is like it. 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered. Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.' (Psalm 110:1)"
"So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From then on, no one could ask him any other question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The students of the School of the Law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
Therefore, you must obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves do not wish to move a single finger to lift them.
All they do is to be seen by people. On the skin of their heads and arms, they wear small images containing verses from the Quran. They make the images very high. And they make the turbans on their coats very long.
They love to sit in the place of honor at banquets. They also love to get the most important seats in Jewish temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love it when people call them "my lord."
"But you shall be called 'children of the Most Merciful.' You are but one community, and I am your Lord and Cherisher."
We do not want to make anyone on earth a "father." You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should be called "teacher." You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Not every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor do you let those who are trying to enter."
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"You blind guides! Which is more important, the gold of the temple, or the temple itself? You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by their oath.'
You are blind and stupid! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
"You are mistaken, "If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is obligated to keep the oath."
O fools! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift sacred?
Therefore, whoever makes a vow to the altar makes a vow to it and everything on it.
And everyone who swears an oath in the name of the temple swears by his name and by the one who dwells in it.
And everyone who swears an oath by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
You are blind leaders! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
"Oh, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like tombs painted white. They appear beautiful on the outside, but inside they are full of dead people's bones. They are also full of other things that are not pure and clean."
It's the same with you. From the outside, you seem to be doing what's right. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend not to be what you are.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have been complicit in the killing of the prophets."
So you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the sins that were started by those who lived before you!
"You are offspring of venomous snakes! How will you escape the sentence of hell?"
So I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and chase from town to town.
Let him pay the price for the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I want to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is still empty.
He said to me, "Do not see my face again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'" (Psalm 118:26)
End credits
Jesus went out of the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Take heed, beware of deceit."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and will deceive many.
"Change is coming. Change is coming differently. The progress remains. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us. She is with us."
State strikes state. Kingdom strikes kingdom. People remain hungry. Earthquakes remain in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
"Then people will hand you over to be mistreated and killed. You will be hated by all nations because of me."
At that time, many will abandon their faith. They will detest one another. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
Because evil will grow, the love of most people will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news for the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) one day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof is going to come down to his house to take anything.
No one in the field comes to take his coat.
May those days be a severe torment for pregnant women! May they be a severe torment for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
In those days, there will be terrible suffering. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it again.
If the hour were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
"At that time, something will be proclaimed to you, 'Behold! This is the Christ!' or, 'Here he is!' Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great wonders. They will try to deceive the people chosen by God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
"If anyone tells you, 'He is far out in the desert,' do not go there. Or if anyone says, 'He is deep inside the house,' do not believe it."
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Ostriches gather wherever there is a corpse.
"In the evening of life, the heart's bitter complaint against the modern days," "The sun is darkened. The moon is not bright. The stars are falling from the sky. The heavenly bodies are shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will see his angels marching, beating the drums loudly. They will gather his chosen people from the four directions. They will place them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Certainly, when you see all those things happening, you know the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I want to tell you is true. The people who were living at that time will not die until all this happens.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"Fikru kayfa kina fi ayyam Nooh" translates to "Think about how they were in the days of Noah." The repeated
"In the days before the battle, the people used to say, 'They are coming.' They would prepare. They would call their daughters to the battle. They would do all of this until the day of Noah's flood.
They did not know anything about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
"A man will come into the world. One will come crying and the other will come laughing."
Two women are avoiding each other with a manual grinder. One will be taken and the other will be left.
Be watchful. You do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You've got to understand something. If the homeowner knew what time at night the thief was coming, he would have set a guard. He wouldn't have left his house to be broken into.
So be ready. The Son of Man will come at a time you do not expect.
Suppose a master puts one of his slaves in charge of the other servants in his house. The slave's task is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this task.
The servant will be pleased to find his master doing his work when he returns.
What you are saying is right. The master will make that servant accountable for all that he has.
"Let the servant be wicked. Let him say to himself, 'My master is away for a long time.'"
Suppose he starts beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will return on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then the Lord will cut him off and send him to the place where the hypocrites go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
A Tale of Ten Courtesans
"So will the kingdom of heaven be at that time. The ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The foolish women took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
Those who had wisdom took oil in their jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids were tired and fell asleep.
"At 12:00 midnight, a voice rang out, 'Over here, there's a party! Come and join us!'
Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
The fool said to the wise man, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
" 'No,' they replied. 'There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to the one who sells oil. Buy some for yourselves."
"They went out to buy oil. But on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The feast they had prepared was served at the wedding banquet. Then the house was closed."
"After that, the other waiters served the food. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'
"What I'm telling you is the truth. I don't know you."
"Be watchful! You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. A parable of three servants."
"But lo! there is the kingdom of heaven. The King himself guides the journey. His servant and their deeds are subject to the King's will.
He gave $10,000 to each of them. He gave $4,000 to the first one. And he gave $2,000 to the second one. The man gave the money to the servant to see if the servant was trustworthy. Then he traveled.
The servant who received $10,000 went straight and started investing his money. He made another $10,000.
The one who had $4,000 earned $4,000 more.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of those slaves returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the second $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I made another $10,000."
"Well done, good and faithful servant!" replied the master. "You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!'"
"The man with the $4000 is coming too," he said. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $4000. Look, I've made another $4000."
"Well done, good and faithful servant!" replied the master. "You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!'"
Then came the man who had received $2000. 'Sir,' he said, 'I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not plant seeds.'
So I was scared. I went out and buried $2000 underground. Look, that's what's yours.
"Master, I beseech you, judge, decide! Don't you see where I am burning and cannot change? Don't you see where I spread the envy and cannot loosen the shackles?"
And then, you could put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would bring it back with interest.
"He who reaches his limit, his master will do with the slaves who have covenanted with him, 'Aquil gave 2,000 of that. Give it to whoever guides 20,000 of that.
Those who have will have more. They will have more than enough. And those who have nothing? Even those who have will become nothing.
"Cast that good-for-nothing servant into outer darkness. There, in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth." The sheep and the pigs.
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne."
All nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups, just like a shepherd separates sheep from goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "My Father has blessed you. Come, take your inheritance. This kingdom has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you welcomed me in.
I needed clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to see me.
"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
Why did we see you as a stranger and invite you to our house? Why did we see you as in need of clothes and give them to you?
'Since we saw you were sick or in prison, have we not visited you?'
The king will answer, "What I tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.”
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
"And here are some who say, 'Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us our sins and spare us the punishment of Hellfire. We have believed, so why should we not be guided? We have
He always replies, "Whatever comes back to you is your due. Anything you didn't do for Mou, you didn't do for me either, not even the least important thing."
"Then they will go to eternal punishment. But those who have done good will attain eternal life."
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus said all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They changed their plans to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"Not during the feast," they said. "The people may cause trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
The woman came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
"Why is that?" they asked.
The proof could have been sold at a high price. We could have given the amount to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will not always have the poor with you, but you will always have me.
She began to pour perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What's coming back to you is right. What she did is a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need, a need.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
Answer, "Go to the man in the city. Tell him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will celebrate Easter in your home with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve apostles.
While they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The pupils became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him, "Not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me—that one will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes. You."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
This is My blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This I tell you: From now on, I will not drink the fruit of the vine until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "You will deny me."
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I have risen from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee."
Batr replied, "Everyone can leave you. But I'm not going anywhere."
"What I want to tell you is true," said Jesus. "This will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never abandon you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took a bite and spread butter on it. He started to feel sad and anxious.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
And he went a little further. Then, falling on his face to the ground, he prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.
Look and turn away. After that, don't let yourself fall into sin when you're tempted. It's the soul that wants it. But the body is weak.
Jesus returned a second time. He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. Again he found them sleeping, for they were unable to keep their eyes open.
He gossiped about him and went away again. For the third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is to be handed over to the sinners."
"Rise! Let us go! Here is the one who betrayed me!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, agreed with them on a signal. "Whom I shall kiss, that same is he," he said. "Take him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus replied, "Friend, do what I have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away." "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll instantly raise an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how will the Bible be fulfilled? They say it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Should you have come with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I was sitting in the temple courtyard teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the prophets' words might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Going farther, Peter followed Jesus. He went into the high priest's courtyard and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said: "That companion said, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered, "as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest said, "He has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil thing."
"Don't you believe it?" they replied. "We want him to die!"
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their hands. Others struck him in the face.
They said, "Wake up, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he didn't know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "I was with Jesus of Galilee as well," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are saying," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. Another woman there saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And he insisted that he wasn't. Beyiq said, "I don't know the man!"
A little later, those who were standing there went to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "The way you talk gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." He went outside and wept bitterly.
Jadous hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake. I released a man who was not guilty." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Then he threw the money into the temple and went away. And he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the money. They said, "It is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to take it to buy the potter's field. Strangers from other lands will be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words of Jeremiah the prophet became true. He said, "They took thirty pieces of silver. That was the price set for him by the people of Israel.
"They used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no answer to any of the charges, not even to one. The governor was amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. Knowing this, he handed Jesus over to them.
While Bilat sat on the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Do nothing with that man. He is not guilty. I suffered a lot in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to kill Jesus.
"Which of the others do you want to set free?" asked the governor. "The one in the middle," they answered.
"Do you have a thought or an answer about Jesus and his teaching?" said Pilate. They all shouted, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Belatis saw that he wasn't going to get anywhere. Instead, the crowd started to get angry. So, he took some water and washed his hands in front of them. "I have no guilt in this man's death," he said. "You are responsible for this!"
Everyone replied, "We and our children will accept the guilt for his death!"
Pilate releases Barabbas. But he has Jesus scourged. Then he hands him over to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they bound the thorns together and made a crown, and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put it on him. Then they led him away to be crucified on a cross. Jesus is crucified on a cross.
By them he went out of the city, and they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross.
He went to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to him to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They kept sitting behind him and behind him.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two thieves are crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, laughed at him, and shook their heads.
He said, "So you want to destroy the temple and build it again in three days? After that, save yourself! I will come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same order, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Come on, Lord, come down from the cross! Then we will believe in him."
May God keep him. May God keep him. May God keep him. May God keep him. May God keep him. May God keep him. May
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also reviled him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three o'clock, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those standing there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately, someone ran and took a sponge; he filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth trembled. The rocks split.
Tombs were opened. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman centurion and those guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They cried out, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there as well. So was the mother of Zebedee's sons. They buried Jesus.
As the evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that the liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
Therefore he commanded them to seal the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal the body, and then say to the people, 'Jesus has risen from the dead.' This last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
So go and make the tomb secure. Put a seal on the stone and set a guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
It was Saturday evening. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
So the women hurried away from the tomb, fearful yet filled with joy. They ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. "Greetings!" he said. They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards went and told the chief priests.
While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while I was sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him. This will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders of Jesus to his disciples.
Then the twelve disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
"Wherever they go, they worship him. But some still have doubts."
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore you must go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Malachi wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came and preached to the people in the wilderness. He preached to them and told them that they must repent and leave their sins. And then God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people of Jerusalem also went out. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
"And here in what John fears. Afterwards, someone must run from me. I don't allow anyone to interfere and interfere with his steps."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. Suddenly he saw the heavens splitting open. He saw the Holy Spirit coming down on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There Satan tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels tended to him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled," "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he did so, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants. And they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as one with authority. He did not speak like the scribes.
Suddenly, a man cried out in their temple. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Jesus said sternly, "Be quiet!" "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him went out of the synagogue. Immediately they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. He got her out of the fever. Then she started serving them.
That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in town gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many people. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still very early, and darkness covered the land. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I also need to preach there. That's why I came."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. He preached in their synagogues, cast out demons, and healed every disease and every affliction among the people. Jesus healed a man who had been suffering from a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he asked Jesus. He said, "If you want to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be made clean!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Then Jesus sent him away quickly. He gave the man a stern warning.
He said, "Do not say this to anyone," "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in secluded places, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned home.
The crowd was so large that there was no room left, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is he saying this? He's saying something terrible! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to him, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said, "I say to you, rise. Take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. They were all astounded. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus raises Lazarus.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Then Jesus was dining at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees often fasted. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John are fasting, and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting too. But your disciples are not fasting. Why not?"
Jesus replied, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't use a new piece of cloth to patch old clothes. If they do, the new patch will stand out from the old. Thus, the tear will only get wider.
People don't put new wine in old wineskins. If they do, the wine will ferment and burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they put new wine in new wineskins."Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath
One Sabbath Jesus was walking through fields of grain with his disciples. His disciples began to break off some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He said, "Didn't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the hallowed bread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"The Son of Man is Lord, even on the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
When Jesus went back to the synagogue, there was a man with a weakened and distorted hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would perform healings on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man with the withered and distorted hand, "Stand up before everyone."
So Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good, or should we do evil? Should we save a life, or should we kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around at them in anger. He was greatly distressed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might kill Him. A large crowd was following Jesus.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
We hear about all that Jesus is doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to get him a small boat. This would keep people from crowding him.
Jesus had healed many people. So the sick rushed to touch him.
People with evil spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They have authority to cast out demons.
So he appointed the twelve. And Simon was one of them, to whom he gave the name Peter.
There were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot were also there.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemy. Jesus and Beelzebul.
Jesus entered the house. Another crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take charge of him. They said, "He is insane."
Some of the scribes were there. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is under the authority of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons!"
So Jesus called them and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
