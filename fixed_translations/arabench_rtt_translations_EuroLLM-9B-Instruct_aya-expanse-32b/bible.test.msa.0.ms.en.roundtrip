Jesus came and called a little child, and set him in the midst of them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me."
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me were to be led into sin? If they did, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.

"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire will burn you forever."
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray. Won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that is straying?
What I tell you is the truth. If that sheep is found, there will be more joy over it than over ninety-nine sheep that did not wander astray.
It's the same with your Father in heaven. He doesn't want to lose any of these little ones. When someone sins against you,
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But what if he doesn't listen to you? Then take one or two others along with you. For a fact, it is written: "At the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
"Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven."
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." - "The Servant Who Had No Mercy"
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money that his servants owed him.
When the king began to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought forward.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The slave fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll give everything back."
The lady felt pity for him. She forgave his debt and allowed him to leave.
But then that slave went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him. "Pay me what you owe me!" he said.
"The other servant fell on his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I will pay you back.'"
But the chief steward refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison, where he will be kept until he pays back his debt.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then he called the first servant. "You wicked servant," he said, "I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Is it not your duty to have mercy on the other servant as I had mercy on you?
In anger, his master turned him over to the guards. He will be punished until he has paid back all his debts.
"This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning God made them 'male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They asked, "Then why did Moses command a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But from the beginning it was not so.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If that's how it is between husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Some may have been born that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Little children are brought to Jesus."
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) Love your neighbor as yourself. (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all those commandments. What more do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were absolutely amazed. They asked, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you," "when everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left their home or family or fields because of me will receive a hundred times as much, and will also receive eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At about nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go to my vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing."
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why were you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received the usual daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received his daily wage.
When they received it, they began to suspect the owner.
They said: "These people who were recently appointed only worked for an hour, and you paid them the same amount you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am being fair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the same pay to those I've recently hired.
Do I have the right to do what I want with my money? Do you feel cheated because I gave generously to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his impending death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside and began to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem." "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law. They will condemn him to death.
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. They will mock him and beat him and crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for help.
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She fell at his feet and asked him to grant her a request.
Jesus asked her, "What do you want?" She said, "Promise me that one of my sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise that the other may sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten disciples heard about this. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever among you wants to be important should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be a slave to you.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men cried out even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?" He asked.
"O Lord," they answered, "we want to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me.
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The Master will send them money right away.
And this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, as he says:
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
Bring the donkey and the colt. Put their clothes on them. Then Jesus sat on the clothes.
Large crowds of people in their finery lined the streets. Others cut branches from the trees and scattered them across the road.
Some people went before him, and some followed him. They all cried out, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you are making it a 'den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
The blind and disabled people came to Jesus in the temple. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? It says, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'" (Psalm 8:2).
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there that night. The fig tree withered away.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And suddenly the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority was questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus said, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" And they argued with each other, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We fear people. Everyone thinks John is a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither can I tell you by what authority I do these things. The Parable of the Two Sons.
What do you think of this? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do that," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will go, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" They answered, "The first." And Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. I saw this. But even then you did not leave your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another parable. A man had a vineyard, and he planted it, and built a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and rented it out to farmers, and went on a journey.
As the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He told the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. But the tenants treated them no differently.
Finally, he sent his son to them. "They will respect my son," he said.
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit the owner's property someday. Let's kill him, then everything will be ours."
So they took him and drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?
"These wicked men," they answered, "shall be cut off. Then shall the vineyard be let out to other husbandmen, who shall render the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22, 23)
"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit."
Anyone who falls on those stones will be crushed to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They realized he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. For the people held that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding dinner story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
So shall the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
He sent his servants to the guests for dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out other servants. He said: "Tell those who were invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my fatted calf and ox. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The others seized his slaves. They treated them cruelly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the slaves went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said, "My friend, how did you enter here without your wedding clothes?" The man could not think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, no matter how important they are.
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Who is this picture of? And what are these words?"
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished. So they left him and went away. The wedding when the dead rise.
On that day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people are raised from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same incident happened to the second and third brothers. It continued until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.
Jesus said, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers allow them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
Someone was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment of the law?"
Jesus said: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." Who is the son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered. Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
"So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus came to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
For you must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They load heavy burdens on others' shoulders, but they themselves wouldn't move them even with a finger.
All that they do is to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes on their garments very long.
They love to sit in the place of honor at dinner. They also love to get the most important seats in Jewish temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love it when people call them "my lord."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for there is but one Father, who is in heaven.
You shall not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
Your servant will be the most important person among you.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are entering go in."
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"Oh, you blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'"
You are blind and ignorant! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the structure that makes gold sacred?
As it is written, "If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated to keep his oath."
O ye blind ones! Which is greater? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift holy?
For whoever swears an oath by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And everyone who swears an oath in the name of the temple swears by his name and by the one who dwells in it.
And everyone who swears an oath by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
You blind fools! You pick out the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel!
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. You, too, look outwardly, not inward.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed look beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
The same applies to you. From the outside, you appear to be doing what's right. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say: "If we had been alive in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have participated in the killing of the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So desist from the sins which those who lived before you started!
"Your nest is full of venomous snakes! How will you escape the judgment of going to hell?"
For I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city.
You will pay the price for the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the altar and the sanctuary.
What I am telling you is the truth. All this will happen to those who are living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple and was going away when his disciples came to point out to him the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him in secret. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Beware! See that no one leads you astray."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am Christ!" and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear of future wars. Do not be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then you will be handed over to be oppressed and killed, and all nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will turn against each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
Because evil will grow, the love of most people will decrease.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, to all nations, and then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) which one day you will see standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their home to get anything.
No one in the field needs to go back to get their coat.
How terrible it will be in those days for pregnant women! How terrible for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than anything since the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If the hour were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will arise. They will perform great wonders. They will try to deceive the elect of God, if possible.
Look, I've told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's far out in the desert," do not go. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," do not believe it.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Eagles will gather wherever there is a corpse.
"In the face of the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. He will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
"Learn the parable of the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near."
Similarly, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I tell you is true. People who live in that time will not die until all those things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind food using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other will be left.
So be on your guard: you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have stayed awake. He wouldn't have allowed his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a master puts one of his slaves in charge of the other servants in his house. The slave's task is to give them their food at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this purpose.
It will be good for the servant if his master finds him doing his work when the master returns.
What I tell you is true. The master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master will be away for a long time."
Suppose he starts beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will return on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then Mr. cuts him into pieces. He sends him to the place where the protesters go. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
A Tale of Ten Courtesans
So shall the kingdom of heaven be at that time. Then shall ten virgins go out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The ignorant ones took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in their jars along with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So, all the married brides became tired and dozed off.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the little brides woke up and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
" 'No,' they replied. 'There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But as they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the bride went in to him, and the door was shut.
Later, the other brides came too. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am telling you is true. I do not know you."
"Therefore be alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The parable of the three servants.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one, $4,000 to another, and $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he continued on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and started investing his money, and he made an additional profit of $10,000.
He who got $4000 got an additional $4000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His lord answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
The man with $4000 has also come. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000."
His lord answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
Then came the man who had received the $2000. "Sir," he said, "I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not scatter seeds.
So I was afraid. I went out and buried $2000 in the ground. Look, this is yours.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow? Did you know that I gather where I did not scatter seed?"
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have taken it back with interest.
Then the master commanded the other servants, "Take 2000 dollars from him. Give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars."
To those who have, more will be given. They will have more than enough. And what about those who have not? Even what they have will be taken from them.
"Drive out that good-for-nothing slave. Out in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth." The sheep and the pigs
The Son of Man will come in his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before him. People will be separated into two groups. It will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me into your home.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you nursed me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and invite you into our homes? And when did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and come to visit you?
The king will answer, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me into your home. I was in need of clothes. But you gave me none of yours. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They will also say, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? And when did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will answer, "What I tell you is true. Anything you have not done for one of these least ones, you have not done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered to the cross.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
They said, "But not during the festival, lest the people become riotus." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume might have been sold at a high price. The money might have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
There will always be poor people with you. But you will not always be with me.
I poured the perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I tell you is true. What I have done will be proclaimed everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told, in remembrance of me." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
He answered: "Go to the city to a certain man. Say to him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve apostles.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The pupils became very sad. They began to ask him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish will betray me."
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "I am not, Lord, am I?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
This I tell you: From now on, I will not drink the fruit of the vine with you until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This night, all of you will fall away from me, for it is written in the Scriptures, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7).
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Maybe others will stay away because of you. But I never will."
"What I tell you is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Peter took the two sons of Zebedee with him. He began to feel sad and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
A little while later, he fell to the ground with his face in the dirt. He prayed, "Abba, Father, if it is possible, may this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
"Look and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And he prayed the same prayer for the third time.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Arise! Let us go! There he is, who betrayed me!" The arrest of Jesus.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived, one of the Twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, arranged a signal with them. "Whomever I greet with a kiss, he is the one," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions grasped his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away. All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how can the scriptures be fulfilled? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Should you bring swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I was sitting in the temple courtyard teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
He was not far away, and he followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses appeared. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes, as you say," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his evil words yourselves."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They hit him with their hands. Others punched him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who is it that struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "I also was with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he had not done it. "I do not know what you are saying," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. Another woman there saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He repeated that he wasn't there. He swore, saying, "I don't know the man!"
And after a little while, those who stood by drew near to Peter, saying, "Surely you are one of them, for your speech betrays you."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it does, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
Bind him, and take him away. Then deliver him to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake. I convicted an innocent man." They replied, "What's it to us? That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests chose the coins. They said, "It is against the law to put this money into the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy the pottery field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said, "They paid thirty pieces of silver, the price set by the people of Israel.
"They used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no answer to any of the charges, not even to the one charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him."
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that man, for I have suffered much in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to kill Jesus.
The governor said, "Which one do you want me to release?" They answered, "Barabbas."
"What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere. Instead, the crowd began to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "You are responsible!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will accept the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they wove thorns together to make a crown. They put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him. "We honor you, King of the Jews!" they said.
They insulted him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his clothes on him and led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
As they led him out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
And they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of the Skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices, and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and watched him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted insults at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
The chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders also mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. May God deliver him now, if He wills. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
Likewise the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also reviled Him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Suddenly, someone took a cloth soaked in vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's veil was torn from top to bottom. The earth trembled. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. Many of the saints who had died came back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and cried out, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
It was not far off, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to provide for His needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary the mother of James and Joseph was also there. The mother of Zebed's sons was also there. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Sir, we remember something the liar said while he was alive. He claimed, 'I will rise again after three days.'"
So they ordered the soldiers to guard the tomb until the third day, lest Jesus' disciples come and steal the body, and then claim to people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. These last lies would be worse than the first.
Pilate answered, "Take soldiers, go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now the Sabbath had ended. At dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shines like lightning. His clothes are white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He was not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
The women fled from the tomb. They were afraid, but also filled with joy. They hurried to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said. Then they came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards went and told the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His followers came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him. That'll keep you out of trouble."
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders of Jesus to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshipped him. But some still doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The prophet Isaiah wrote long ago: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
The angel in the desert says: "Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight." (Isaiah 40:3)
So John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the people of the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. And confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Thus John preached, saying, "One mightier than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
While he was doing this, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
Jesus was in the wilderness for forty days. There he was tempted by the devil. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose the first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
Suddenly, a man cried out in their temple. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Jesus said firmly: "Be silent!" "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They went immediately with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to wait on them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness had not yet lifted. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simeon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. And he was teaching in their synagogues, and casting out demons. Jesus taught a man who had a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he asked Jesus. He said, "If you are willing to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do this," he said. "Be clean!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus sent him away immediately. And he gave the man a stern warning.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this," "Go and show yourselves to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people still came to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man unable to walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no more room. Not even outside the door was there space. And Jesus was preaching the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some Islamic scholars were sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is this man speaking this way? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Jesus perceived their thoughts, and said to them, "Why do you think these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know," Jesus said to him, "that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
He said, "I tell you, get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. They were all astounded. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus raises Lazarus.
Jesus returned to the seashore of Galilee. A large crowd came to him and he began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus ate dinner at Lazarus's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" ate with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
