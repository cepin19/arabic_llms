udio: The Family Lineage of Jesus
This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham is the father of Isaac. Isaac is the father of Jacob. Jacob is the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah is the father of Perez and Zerah. Tamar is their mother. Perez is the father of Hezron. Hezron is the father of Ram.
Ram is the father of Aminadab. Aminadab is the father of Nahshon. Nahshon is the father of Salmon.
Salmon is the father of Boaz. Rahab is the mother of Boaz. Boaz is the father of Obed. Ruth is the mother of Obed. Obed is the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Asa.
And Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram, and Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah is the father of Jotham. Jotham is the father of Ahaz. Ahaz is the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah made Jehoahaz his father, and his brethren. In those days the Jews were carried away captive to Babylon.
And afterward, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zephaniah was the father of Jecoliah, Jecoliah was the father of Ahasiah, and Ahasiah was the father of Azariah.
Azor is the father of Zadok. Zadok is the father of Achimaas. Achimaas is the father of Jahaziel.
Eliehod is the father of Eliezr. Eliezr is the father of Matan. Matan is the father of Yaakov.
Jacob is the father of Joseph. Joseph is the husband of Mary. And Mary is the one who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the deportation to Babylon. There were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon until the Messiah, whose name is Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a good man. He didn't want to bring her shame in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
"You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had said would happen. He had spoken through the prophet,
The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (which means "God with us"). (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
Wise men visit Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they continued on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their hearts were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their hometown by a different route. The Jesus family fled to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is searching for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph took the child and his mother Mary and left for Egypt during the night.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, fulfilling the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he became furious. He issued orders to Bethlehem and the surrounding area, decreeing that all boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, who said:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Jacob arose and took his children and his wives, and his nurses and all his belongings, and set out on a journey to the land of Canaan.
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
And he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus: "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
It is John who the prophet Isaiah spoke about, saying: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths'" (Isaiah 40:3).
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe has already fallen at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"So he carries a flail in his hand to clean the straw from his barn. He will gather his wheat into the storehouse. But he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire." - "The Parables of Jesus"
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be, for thus it is fitting to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tested.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting from food, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written in the Scriptures: 'The Lord will command his angels concerning you. They will lift you up in their hands. So that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)"
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate yourself before me and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Jesus said was fulfilled, for he said:
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine upon them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Then Jesus chose the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called out to them.
So they immediately left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought all the sick, those suffering from various diseases. Some were in severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus blesses people.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people have mistreated the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But what if the salt loses its saltiness? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
In this way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
What I tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before one jot or tittle of the law passes away. Not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the law until all is fulfilled.
Do not break even one of the lesser commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice these commandments and teach them. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
"So I say to you, you must be more righteous than the Pharisees and teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder"
You have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. It was said to them, "Do not murder." (Exodus 20:13) Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raka,’ will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Suppose you are presenting your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. Go first and make peace with your brother. Then come back and give your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still on your way with him. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm telling you is the truth. You're not getting out until you pay the last penny! Adultery
I heard it said, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But that is what I am saying to you: Do not look at a woman lustfully. For anyone who looks at her lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is but a part of your body. It is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell."
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But that is what I am saying to you. Everyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and everyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. It is not lawful for a man to divorce his wife except for unfaithfulness. I swear to God.
Once again, I have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, "Do not break the promises you made to the Lord. Keep the oath you made to him."
But this is what I'm telling you. Never make such promises. Don't make them in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. It is God's foothold. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
"Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black."
Let "yes" mean "yes" and "no" mean "no". Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
I heard them say, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But that's what I'm telling you. Don't fight an evil person. "If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Suppose someone sues you for your shirt. Let him have your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Go two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
"I heard them say, 'Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But this is what I say to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do that."
If you only greet those from your tribe, what more are you doing than others? Even people who don't believe in God do that.
So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Providing assistance to people in need.
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in the temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Don't be like them. My father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray. " "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
Protect us from sin when we are tempted by it. Deliver us from the accursed devil.
Forgive people who have wronged you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. - Fasting
When you go without eating, do not look sad like those who only pretend to be holy. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I am telling you is true. They have received their full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"And what do you care about clothes? Look how wildflowers grow. They don't work and make clothes."
But that is what I am telling you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
"If God clothes the grass of the field, will He not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!"
So don't worry. Don't say, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
Unbelievers chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. You will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure by which you measure others.
You notice a little sawdust in your friend's eye. But you pay no attention to the plank in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get that splinter out of your eye"? How can you say this when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, will you give him a snake?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and the small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk this path.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit. And a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name do many mighty works?' But I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will declare to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' - The wise and foolish builders
"Whoever hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain comes. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"The rain comes. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. And it falls with a great crash."
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Teach like one who has authority. Don't speak like their law teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do so."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
He said, "O Lord, Your servant in his house cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man of authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I tell this one, "Go," and he goes. I tell that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have yet to find anyone in Israel with such great faith.
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill the prophet Isaiah's word: "He carried our weaknesses and bore our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus comes at a cost.
Jesus saw the crowd around him. He asked his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a severe storm arose on the lake. The waves overwhelmed the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him, saying, "Master! Master! We are perishing!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and they ceased. The sky became calm again.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He met two men possessed by demons. They came out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to mock us before our judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who had been tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and reported all these things, and told what had happened to the demoniacs.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man unable to walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his town.
Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he turned to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was at the home of Matthew having dinner. Many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't put a new patch on old clothes. The new patch will come away from the old one. This will increase the tear.
"People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will flow out, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him, pleading, "My daughter has just died. But come and place your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
I thought: "I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus turned and looked at her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed instantly.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
And when the multitude had been put out, Jesus went in, took her by the hand, and the maiden arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith it will be done to you."
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowds were amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were weary and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Therefore ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, and two others, James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who would later betray Jesus into the hands of his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go into any Gentile territory," he said. "Do not enter any Samaritan town.
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
Do not take with you gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Don't take a suitcase for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker must be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to host you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I say to you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you are to say or how you are to say it. In that hour what you are to say will be given to you.
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
"Brothers will turn each other in to be killed. Parents will turn in their children. Children will rise up against their parents and execute them."
Everyone will hate you because of me. But those who stand firm to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is the truth. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
No student excels their teacher. No slave excels their master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can those who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything secret will be revealed. Everything hidden will be made known.
What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light. What you hear whispered, proclaim from the housetops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Is it not two sparrows sold for a farthing? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
And what about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set "sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
A man's enemies will be those of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And assume that someone welcomes a holy figure as a holy figure. That person will receive the reward of a holy figure.
Suppose someone even gave a cup of cold water to a little child following me. What I am telling you is true. That person will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples, and then continued teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the poor have the good news preached to them.
"Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me."
And while the disciples of Jacob and John were leaving, Jesus began to speak about Jacob in front of the crowd, saying: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? Grass blowing in the wind?"
And if not, what did I go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is mentioned in the Bible. The verse says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I tell you is true. No one is more important than John the Baptist, but the least important person in the Kingdom of Heaven is more important than John the Baptist.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was to come.
"Let those who have ears hear."
What can I compare people to today? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to others. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a dirge, but you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is proved right by her actions." Cities that never repent of sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Comfort for those who feel weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. That's what I wanted.
"My father gave me everything. A father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to make him known."
Come to me, all you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.
"Become my disciples and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
"It's an easy task for me, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to break off the heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is against the law on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his companions ate the sacred bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.
Have you read the Law? It tells us how the priests in the temple are to do their work every Sabbath day, yet they are not considered guilty.
I say to you, something more important than the temple is here.
The Bible says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse those who are innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
From there, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and distorted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! Therefore the laws allow us to do good on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. And it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. He left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed them of every disease.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. He says:
"This is my servant, whom I have chosen; he is my beloved, in whom I am well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim to the nations that all things shall be well."
He will not quarrel or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
A bent twig will not break. A flickering flame will not fade. Everything will be mended.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see things.
All the people were amazed, and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil casts out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? They will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what the man owns? You must first bind him. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come.
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"Your nest is full of venomous snakes! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts."
A good man speaks good things. These come from the good that is put within him. An evil man speaks evil things. These come from the evil that is put within him.
But that is what I am telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." The mark of the Greek miracle.
They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation. The Ninevites will prove this generation guilty, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry places seeking a resting place, but it finds none.
He then says: "I will return to the house I left." And when he gets there, he finds the house empty. I was able to clean the house and put it in good condition.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with him seven other evil spirits more wicked than himself. They go in and live there, and the man becomes worse than before. So will it be with this evil generation." Jesus' mother and brothers arrived.
And Jesus was still speaking to the crowds when his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
He was told, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
Everyone who does what my Father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd of people gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by means of stories, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Another seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plant.
And others said, "The seed that fell on the good soil grew up and yielded a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold what was sown."
"Those who have ears, let them hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
Those who have this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have plenty. If anyone does not have this kind of knowledge, what little they have will be taken from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said, "You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
"Their hearts have become callous. They barely hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, repent, and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am telling you is the truth. Many prophets and holy people wanted to see what you see. But they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they did not hear it.
Listen! Here's the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that is sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately accept it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they do not last long. They quickly abandon the faith when trouble or suffering arises because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promise of wealth choke them, preventing them from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's slaves came to him. They said, "Master, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "One of the enemies did this." The servants asked, "Do you want us to go and remove the weeds?"
" 'No,' the owner replied. 'When you pull the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them.'"
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of all garden plants and becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman mixed yeast into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke to the crowds about all these things in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So the words of the prophet came true. For he said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the grasses.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels. They will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
He will cast them into the furnace of fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears hear. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field."
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of rare pearls.
And he found one of great value. He went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish."
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish back into the sea.
Thus it will be on the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get the power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
Because of their unbelief, few miracles were done there.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. He was delighted with her.
He promised her by his right hand that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod had John's head cut off in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
They answered, "We have five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring them to me here."
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments that were left.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate too. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the multitude away.
And after sending them away, he went up into the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The ship had already moved away from the land. It was being battered by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said, and wept in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If you are, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow the sick to touch only the edge of his clothes, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked:
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also said, "He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents by giving them gifts. You make God's word useless by following your own teachings.
"You are hidden! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
They honor me with what they say, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus came to the crowds and called out to them, saying, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth doesn't make it 'dirty'. It's what comes out of your mouth that makes it 'dirty'.
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father has not planted in heaven. They will be uprooted.
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely afflicted by a demon."
Jesus did not say a word. His disciples came to him and asked, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
Reply: "It is not right for you to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, Lord." "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain side and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the crippled, the mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and two fish." "Where shall we get enough bread to feed so large a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining food.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
The people ask Jesus for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Reply: "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students discussed this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is small! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets you gathered?
Do you remember the seven loaves that fed the four thousand? Do you remember how many baskets of pieces were collected?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to be careful about the yeast used in bread. He was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. And Peter said that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
Thus I tell you: You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save himself, he will lose it. But if he loses it for me, he will find it.
What good is it to gain the whole world if a man loses his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father. His angels will come with him, and he will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I say to you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus appeared to be transformed.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were afraid. They fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Arise," he said. "Do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. As they were coming down, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him.
He said, "Oh Lord, have mercy on my son. He shivers severely and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You brood of vipers! How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If your faith is as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to therewhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhenwhen
(No
They met in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, it is," he replied. And when Peter had come into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" He asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth?

"From the others," Peter answered. "So the children will not have to pay," Jesus told him.
