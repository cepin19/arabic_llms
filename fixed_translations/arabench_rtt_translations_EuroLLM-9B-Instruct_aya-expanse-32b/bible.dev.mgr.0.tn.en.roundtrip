khoa Jesus' family tree
khoa is a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham is the father of Isaac. Isaac is the father of Jacob. Jacob is the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah is the father of Perez and Zerah. Their mother was Tamar. Perez is the father of Hezron. Hezron is the father of Ram.
khoa is the father of Aminadab. Aminadab is the father of Nahshon. Nahshon is the father of Salmon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon. Solomon's mother had been the wife of Uriah.
khoaleyman is the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam is the father of Abijah. Abijah is the father of Asa.
Asa is the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat is the father of Jehoram. Jehoram is the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah is the father of Jotham. Jotham is the father of Ahaz. Ahaz is the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh is the father of Amon. Amon is the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Joachim was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Azariah. Azariah was the father of Jehoram.
Azor is the father of Zadok. Zadok is the father of Akim. Akim is the father of Eliud.
Eliezer is the father of Matan. Matan is the father of Jacob. Eliud is the father of Eliezer.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the carrying away to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the carrying away to Babylon to Christ. And Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Joseph was a good man. He didn't want to bring her shame in public. So he planned to quietly divorce her.
It is not Joseph who is thinking this; an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, for the child within her is of the Holy Spirit."
She is with child, a son. You shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet.
"Virginity is a ruse. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha h
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she had borne a son, and he called his name Jesus.
The apostles visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star rise, and we have come to worship him."
King Herod heard about this and was greatly angered. All the people of Jerusalem were perturbed as well.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied. "This is what the prophet has written."
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
I sent them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search for the child carefully. As soon as you find him, let me know. Then I can go and worship him too."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east rose before them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another route. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
After the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is searching for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph arose. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until King Herod died. And the words of the Lord spoken through the prophet were fulfilled: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the boys under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah came true. He had said,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Then Jesus returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph woke up and took the child and his mother Mary to the land of Israel.
but afterward he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in the place of his father Herod. And he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee instead.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. What the prophets had said about Jesus came true. They had said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Depart from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
John is the person of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight his paths.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went down to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.
The sickle is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be uprooted. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, calling you to turn away from your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
"He has his pitchfork in hand to clear the straw from his field. He will gather the wheat into the barn. But he will burn the straw with a fire that cannot be quenched." Imad Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now. It is right that we do this. He is fulfilling God's holy plan." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Isa is being tested.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' And 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus begins his ministry in the gospel.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"In this way, what the prophet Jesus said came true. He said,"
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
And afterward he saw two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them, and immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout all Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus made them all well.
Large crowds accompanied him, including some from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, and Judea, as well as others from across the Jordan River.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
"Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the humble, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"May the blessings of those who come after you overtake you and may they never cease to speak kindly of you. May the blessings of those who are with you never cease to speak kindly of you."
Good news and joy. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden."
And likewise, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. They put it on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
"With the same measure, let your country stand before others. Then they will see the good deeds you do. And they will praise your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives the true interpretation of the Law."
We don't want to believe that we came to undermine what is described in the Sharia or in the prophets. We didn't come to do that. Instead, we came to give full meaning to what is described.
What I want to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter or stroke of the law passes away. Not the smallest letter of the law will pass away until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the least important of the commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
"I had nothing to tell you. You want to equate God with the Pharisees and the legal experts. But you are not, you do not belong to the heavenly kingdom. Kill him."
I heard what was told to the people who lived long ago. They were told, "Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Anyone who kills will be brought to justice for it."
And this is what I say to you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the council. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
Imagine the water and the mud the men of your village are carrying on their shoulders. And you remember your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. Go first and make peace with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.
Assume someone has a lawsuit against you and is taking you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still on good terms with them. If you don't, they'll take you to the judge. The judge will hand you over to the officer. And you might end up in jail.
There's nothing you can say to me that's true. You're not getting out until you pay the last penny! Adultery.
"I have heard it said, 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)"
But that's what will upset you. Don't look at a girl the wrong way. Anyone who does that is actually married to her in their heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell."
"It is written, 'When a man puts away his wife, he shall give her a bill of divorcement.' (Deuteronomy 24:1)"
However, this is not what I would tell you. Every mortal man tells his wife to be patient. And every mortal man's wife tells him to be patient. A man can only be mortal to his wife if she was never loyal to him. Swear it.
Once again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago. It was said to them, "Do not break the promises you made to the Lord. Keep the oath you made to him."
And here's what I'm telling you. Never make such promises at all. Don't make them in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
You shall not make them in the name of the Earth. This is the chair for the feet of God. You shall not make them in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city for the great King.
And do not take an oath by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Just let 'yes' mean 'yes'. Let 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
I have heard it said, 'An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"But that's what will upset you. Don't resist an evil person." "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well."
Someone suggested you take him to court for your shirt. Let him take your coat as well.
If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
"Give to anyone who asks you for something. Do not turn your back on someone who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies."
"I heard it said, 'Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
There's nothing I can say to you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even tax collectors do the same."
Why would you doubt that?
Be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to people in need.
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"He praises the strange people, considering them blessed. He is with the old, independent family. They understand what the Yathribi mosque and Saturday are. They understand Saturday. They understand Saturday. They understand Saturday. They understand what is in it."
"When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then he will reward you secretly. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them. Prayer
"You win, you don't win, you win, you don't win, you win, you don't win, you win, you don't win, you win, you don't win, you win, you don't win, you win, you don't win."
"When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
"When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
We don't want you to be like them. My father knows what you need before you ask him.
"That troubles me." "Father in heaven, sanctify his name.
May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Deliver us from falling into sin when we are in distress. Deliver us from the evil one.
Forgive people if they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
It is not for you to take people's sins to forgiveness, nor will your father forgive you your sins. Fasting.
"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
"You come without eating, you'll have olive oil on your head. Wash your face."
Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart is where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, then your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
"It's impossible for anyone to serve two masters at the same time. They will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money at the same time. Do not worry."
He told me, "Do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, and do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not things more important for the body than clothes?"
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap crops. They do not store crops in barns. Yet my Father in heaven feeds them. Aren't you worth more than they are?
"Can you add one hour to your life by worrying?"
"Why aren't you changing your clothes? Understand how sea roses are counted. They are the ones feared for the work or the arrangement of clothes.
Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
"If God dresses the wild grass, will He not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today only. Tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!"
So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who don't care about God run after all these things. My Father in heaven knows you need them.
"Seek first the kingdom of God. Do what God wants you to do. Then all these things will be added to you."
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
"Don't judge others, for you are not judged by them."
You will be judged by the same standards by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measures by which you measure others.
"A speck of sawdust in your friend's eye, but a log in your own."
How can you tell your friend, "Let me remove a piece of wood from your eye"? How can you say that with a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Assume your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or what if he asks for a fish? Who among you would give him a snake?
If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people go on this road.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
You can tell their true nature by what they do. "Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Certainly, every good tree bears good fruit. But a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Every tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
"Everyone will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many miracles in your name?'"
Then I will declare to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' The wise builder and the foolish builder.
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The water is rising. The wind is blowing and beating against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
"Not everyone who hears my words and does not act on them is a foolish person. He builds his house on the sand."
Water falls. Water rises. Winds blow and strike that house. And it crashes down with force.
Jesus finished all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Teach as one having authority. He did not speak as the scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer with faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
He said, "O Lord, Your servant is sick in his house and cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man of authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as great as this."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who believe they belong to the kingdom will be thrown out, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus took her by the hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
For he did this to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said, "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) It is the cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the crowd around him. He asked his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
And Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves overwhelmed the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are drowning!"
"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They had come out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Sons of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before the time of judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They went into the town and spread the news. They told everyone what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into the boat, and went across the lake to his own town.
Some men brought him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
You must know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Rise," he said. "Take up your bed and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the people went to see this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chose when.
As Jesus walked on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Then Jesus had a dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They were eating with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn the meaning of 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus replied, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't mix new cloth with old. The new piece will come out of the old. It will make the hole worse.
"People don't put new wine in old bottles. If they do, the bottles will burst. The wine will be spilled, and the bottles will be destroyed. No, everyone puts new wine in new bottles. Then both are saved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, "Your daughter is dead. Don't bother the teacher anymore." Jesus overheard him and said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
I thought, "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Jesus called her back. "My lady, do not despair," he said. "Your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she stood up.
The news of what Jesus had done spread throughout the region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your belief will be as you have believed."
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
After the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowds were amazed. They said, "Never before have we seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and sickness.
Watching the crowds, he felt a deep anxiety for them. They were broken and defeated, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
And next Philip and Bartholomew, then Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus, and then Thaddaeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve with the following instructions. "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
On the contrary, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
In the way that you go, preach this message, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
"Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
You won't need a travel bag. You won't need extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker must be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When you enter a house, say peace be upon its inhabitants.
If this house welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it doesn't, don't bless it.
Some people cannot welcome you or listen to your words. If they cannot, shake the dust off your feet when you leave the house or town.
What is coming back to you is right. The Day of Judgment will be easier on Sodom and Gomorrah than on this town.
"I have made you as the mosquitoes in the desert. So be like the living life and the living life."
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will torture you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who are not Jews.
"Be aware, when they arrest you, don't worry about what you can say or how you can say it. At that time, you will be given the right words to say."
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
"Their brothers will deliver up their brothers to death. Their fathers will deliver up their children. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to die."
All people are your enemies from my side. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"Don't come near me, you coward! Get away from me, you miserable wretch. Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away."
"A pupil may surpass his teacher. A servant may surpass his master."
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what can those who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything secret will be made known. Everything hidden will be brought to light.
What I'm telling you in the dark, say it in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
"Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
"I'll count every hair on your head!"
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
"And to him who says before men, 'I know you,' I will say also before My Father who is in heaven, 'I know you.'"
Why would anyone say in front of me that they don't know me? They will say in front of my Father in heaven that they don't know Him.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Boys against their fathers. Girls won't listen to their mothers. Daughters-in-law won't turn against their mothers-in-law.
A man's enemies are the men of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me does not love me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me does not love me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
For someone to find their life, they will lose it. If someone loses their life because of me, they will find it.
Not everyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And everyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. They will receive the reward of a prophet. And suppose someone welcomes a divine figure as a divine figure. They will receive the reward of a divine figure.
"Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my little followers. I tell you the truth, that person will certainly be rewarded."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus replied, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
Blind people regain their sight. Disabled people start walking again. People with skin diseases are healed. Deaf people regain their hearing. Dead people come back to life. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
"Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me."
Since John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
Not like that, what did you go out to see? A man wearing fancy clothes? No. People who wear fancy clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Did you see him? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, more than a prophet.
He is the person mentioned in the Bible. The verse says, "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am saying to you is true. No one is more important than John the Baptist. But the least important person in the Kingdom of Heaven is more important than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
Heya, hwa Eliya li yejri tji mtaa.
"Let those who have ears hear."
"Why do we accept people as they are? They are like children playing together in the street and calling each other. They say,
"I saved the fault for you. But you couldn't. I attended the funeral. But you didn't start crying."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. People say, "He has a devil."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you. And people say, "This man eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." "Those who act wisely prove that their wisdom is right." Cities that do not turn from sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent. He said,
"Oh, if only you, Korazin, had repented, just as Tyre and Sidon have! If only you had witnessed the miracles performed in your midst, they would have repented long ago, putting on sackcloth and sitting on ashes.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
"I say this to you. On the day of judgment, I will be a witness against you." "Rest for All Who Are Tired"
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. That's what I wanted.
"The Father alone hallowed everything. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the one who knows the Father is the Son, and he reveals him to whomever he wishes among the people.
"We are all, each of you, those who are enlightened and you convey great truths. I applaud you."
Be my servants and learn from me. I am a gentle and lowly man. You will find rest for your souls.
"It's an easy task for me, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rub them in their hands to remove the kernels, and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Did you not see who it was that struck you? It was David, he and his men, who were hungry."
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It tells us how the priests in the temple are to do their work every Sabbath day. But they are not guilty.
I tell you that one who is greater than the temple is here.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse people who are not guilty.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
From there, Jesus went to their synagogue.
A man with a withered and paralyzed hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! Therefore the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. He left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed them of every disease.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. He says:
"Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am pleased with him. I will put my spirit on him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright."
He will not quarrel or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
A bent twig will not break. It will not quench a flickering flame. It will correct everything.
"The peoples will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed. They said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
"You cast out demons by Beelzebul's power. But by what power do your people cast them out? They will be your judges."
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
"Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what the man owns? You must first bind him. Then you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
That is why I am telling you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
No one can speak a word against the Son of Man and be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven now or in the future.
"A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"You are offspring of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good man speaks good things. This comes from the good that is put within him. An evil man speaks evil things. This comes from the evil that is put within him.
But that is what will grieve you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every wrong word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified or condemned." The sign of Jonah, the miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"Wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
"The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry places, seeking a resting place. But it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been assessed and put in its place.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with him seven other evil spirits more wicked than himself. They go in and live there, and the man becomes worse than before. So will it be with this evil generation." Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
They told him, "Your mother and sisters are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus, describing his disciples, said: "These are my mother! These are my brothers!"
"I have no brother or sister or mother but those who do the will of my Father in heaven."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he said many things to them in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He sowed the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants sprouted quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, the plants were scorched. They withered because they had no roots.
The last seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and choked the plants.
And another seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop that was a hundred, sixty, or thirty times as much as was sown.
"Those who have ears, let them hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
Answer, "I have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. It has not been given to strangers.
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will get more. In fact, they will get a lot. If no one has this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away.
This is how I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus, who said, "You will hear but not understand. You will see but not comprehend what you see.
"The hearts of these people have become callous. They barely can hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes, otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to God and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I want to tell you is real. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
"Gather! Let's listen to the story of the farmers.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seeds that are sown on the path.
Those who received the seed that fell on rocky places are those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they last only for a short time. They quickly abandon the faith when troubles or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the message. But afterwards, the worries of life and the false promises of wealth cover it up. They will prevent it from bearing fruit.
But others fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
Wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's slaves came to him. They said, "Master, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did this." The slaves asked, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
" 'No,' the owner replied. 'When you pull the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them.'"
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them: "First gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my barn." - Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of all your plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So the words of the prophet came true. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the weed.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Mint is plucked and burned in the fire. Such will be the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all those who do evil.
They will cast them into the fiery furnace. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears, let them hear. Stories of hidden treasure and pearls.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field."
"And He raised His hands, invoking blessings upon the heavens and the earth, and bestowing mercy upon the believers."
He found one very old. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the lake. All kinds of fish were caught in the net.
When they were full, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will cast the wicked into the fiery furnace. There the wicked will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began teaching people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
Since they had no faith, he performed only a few miracles there.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
In the time of Herod the king, John was arrested. He was bound and put in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted.
So he vowed to give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod's reign saw John's beheading in prison.
His head fit in a large plate, and he gave it to the girl. Then, she carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. People heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus replied, "There is no need for them to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to us, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring them to me here."
Then Jesus called the people to sit down on the grass. He took five loaves and two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat. And he said to them, "Go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida." And he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was far from the shore. It was being battered by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and wept in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
So when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said. "Why did you doubt me?"
When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
Then those who were in the boat bowed down to Jesus, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and settled in Genesis.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They wept over him, begging to touch the hem of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and some scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't you listen to what your students say about the elders? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "Why don't you listen to God's command? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20: Life Life Life Life
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
Therefore, they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect in order to keep your own tradition.
"You are the ones who are blind! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
"These people hurt me with their words. And their hearts are still hard."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
"It's not what goes into your mouth that makes you 'unclean'; it's what comes out of your mouth that makes you 'unclean'."
Then his disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus replied, "There are plants that my Father did not plant; they will be uprooted."
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, they will both fall into a pit.
Basher said: "Explain this to us."
"Do you still not understand?" asked Jesus.
"Okay? Everything that goes into your mouth ends up in your stomach. Then it leaves the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. They are what make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying about others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely afflicted by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him, entreating him, "Send her away; for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Lord! Help me!" she said.
Reply, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request will be granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus went there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind were seeing. So the people praised the God of Israel.
So Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed this huge crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
The people ask Jesus for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He said, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say, 'Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must have said that because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Why do you talk about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Or the twelve baskets full of pieces that you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Do you not remember how many baskets you gathered from the fragments?
How is it that you do not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"Why would he doubt me?" he said. "Who do you think I am?"
Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
Peter grabbed Jesus by the arm and began to rebuke him. "This shall not happen, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
Why does he want to save his life, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this?
"What good is it to gain the whole world if one loses their soul? Or what can anyone exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father. His angels will come with Him, and He will reward each according to his works.
"What I want to tell you is true. Some who stand here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jessie shows a change in appearance.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There before them his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were afraid. They fell on their faces.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Arise," he said. "Do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. As they were coming down, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "Yes. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
The man approached Jesus as they neared the crowd. He knelt before him.
"My Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is shivering severely and suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You are an evil and adulterous generation!" replied Jesus. "How long must I remain with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If your faith is as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar
(No
They went together to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter. They asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect from their sons or from others?"
"It is not right," said Peter. "In this case, he cannot pay," said Jesus.
"We have no desire to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the very coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my tax and my brotherαντίαντίαντ
