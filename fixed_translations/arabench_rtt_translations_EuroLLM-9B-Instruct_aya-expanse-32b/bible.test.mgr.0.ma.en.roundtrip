첩rrmost important person in the kingdom?
첵e at time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus came and called a little child to him. He had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
But what if someone who believes in me were to cause one of these little ones to sin? It would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
"Would that it were a curse upon the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Such things must come. But would that it were a curse upon those who cause them!"
"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever."
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"Know that you must not despise even one of these little ones. This is what I am telling you. Their angels in heaven can at any time go to see my Father in heaven."
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep, and one of them wanders away. Won't he leave the 99 on the hills and go look for the one that wandered off?
What I am about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he is more delighted with it than with ninety-nine sheep that did not wander off.
The same is true of your Father in heaven. He does not want to lose any of these little ones. When one of them sins against you...
"If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault. Keep the matter between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back."
But what if they do not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
What if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. What if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am telling you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." "The servant who had no mercy"
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money that his servants owed him.
When the king began to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought forward.
The man was unable to pay. Therefore, his master ordered him. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions had to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay it all back."
His masters felt pity for him. They forgave him and allowed him to leave.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant fell on his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I'll pay you.'
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back his debt.
The other servants saw what happened. It worried them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then he called the first servant. "You wicked servant," he said, "I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Why didn't you show mercy to the other servant as you were shown mercy?
In anger, his master handed him over to the guards. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
"In this way, my Father in heaven will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
Isa knows about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds accompanied him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator 'made them male and female' from the beginning? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are now one, so it is not for man to separate what God has joined.
They said, "What is the reason that Moses commanded that a man could give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you: Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man should not divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If that's how it is between husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Some were born that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Little children are brought to Jesus."
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"What?" asked the man. Jesus said, " 'Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) Love your neighbor as yourself. (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all these commandments. What more shall I do?"
Jesus said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished. They asked, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals, this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What will be given to us as a reward?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also have eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing."
At about five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?'
"Because he did not hire us," they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The workers who were appointed around five o'clock arrived. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received his daily wage.
When they received it, they began to suspect the owner.
They said, "Those people who were hired last time only worked for one hour." "You paid them the same amount you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day."
The companion answered one of them. "My friend," he said, "I will be fair with you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the same pay that I gave you to those I hired before.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave generously to others?
"The last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks about his future death.
Jesus was going to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem." "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. People will mock him and beat him. They will crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother is asking Jesus to help her.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons accompanied her. Kneeling before him, she asked for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom. Grant that the other may sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other eleven disciples heard this. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus came and called them together. He said, "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
You are not like that. Instead, whoever among you wants to be important should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd was following him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
When Jesus stopped, he called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Oh Lord," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied up, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them God needs them. The owner will make them leave immediately.
This happened even before what was said through the prophet was fulfilled. He says,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you. He is humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The disciples paid attention and did what Jesus asked them to do.
Bring the donkey and the horse. Put their clothes on them. Then Jesus sat on the clothes.
Many people hung their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you make it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Blind people and those who were disabled came to Jesus in the temple. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
They said to him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. He cursed the fig tree.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And suddenly the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "What I tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. You can even say to a mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will happen."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you the authority by which I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks John is a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The Two Sons.
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'"
"I won't do it," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, 'I will, sir.' But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. And you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. I saw this. But even then you did not leave your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man owned a piece of land, he planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it. He dug a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He instructed the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; let's kill him. Then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?
They said, "He will destroy those evil people," and then lease the vineyard to other tenants. They will give him his share of the harvest at harvest time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22, 23)
"So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to people who will bear its fruit."
Anyone who falls on the stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized that he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. For the people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
"This is how the kingdom of heaven is. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to the guests for dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent some more servants. He said, "Tell those who were invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest held onto their slaves. They treated them cruelly and then killed them.
The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Friend, how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" she asked. The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, no matter how important they are.
They told us, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus, knowing their wicked plans, said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Who is this picture of? And what are these words?"
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."
And when they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people are raised from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, this is what Moses told us. If a man dies without children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children to carry on his brother's name."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing was happening to the second and third brothers. It continued until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven were married to her."
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures. And you do not know the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers allow them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"What about the dead who are raised? Have you not read what God has told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So Jesus tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." Who is the son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered. Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
For you must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and throw them on the shoulders of others. But they themselves do not want to move a single finger to lift them.
All that they do is to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes on their garments very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at feasts. They also love to get the most important seats in Jewish temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love it when people call them "my lord."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father. You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You do not need to be called "Teacher." You have one Teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are trying to enter."
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"You blind guides! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? You fools! What is more important, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?"
You are blind and ignorant! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
It also says, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he must keep his oath.'
Oh blind men! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift sacred?
"So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it."
And everyone who swears an oath in the name of the temple swears by his name and by the one who dwells in it.
And everyone who swears an oath by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
You blind fools! You pick out the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel!
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
The same goes for you. From the outside, you seem to be doing what's right. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You're pretending to be something you're not.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have helped in the killing of the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So, finish the sins that those who lived before you started!
"You are a nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape the verdict of going to hell?"
For I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and chase them out from city to city.
You will pay the price for the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is still empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End credits
Jesus went out of the temple. As he was going away, his disciples came to him to point out the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said, "Do you see all these things?" "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Be careful that you are not deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am Christ!" and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be afraid. These things must happen, but the end is not yet.
Nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then people will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will turn against each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For the abundance of wickedness will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) one day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof will go home to get anything.
No one in the field needs to go back to get their coat.
It won't be good in those days for pregnant women! Bad for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it again.
If the hour were not shortened, no one would survive. But because of God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! There is Christ!" or, "Here he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will arise. They will perform great wonders. They will try to deceive the elect of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you "It's in the middle of the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Eagles will gather wherever there is a corpse.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. He will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I'm telling you is true. People who live at that time will certainly not die until all those things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes."
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind flour using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
So be on your guard: you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You have to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have been on the alert. He wouldn't have allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a master puts one of his slaves in charge of the other servants in his house. The slave's task is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise slave for this.
It will be good for the servant if his master finds him doing his work when the master returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master will stay away a long time."
Suppose he starts beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will return on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then Mr. will tear him to pieces. He will send him to the place where protesters go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
A Tale of Ten Courtesans
Thus shall the kingdom of heaven be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
The ignorant ones took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
Those who had wisdom took oil in their jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So, all the married brides got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight someone shouted, "Here comes the bridegroom! Come and meet him!"
Then all the little brides woke up and got their lamps ready.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
" 'No,' they replied. 'There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to the one who sells oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But as they were going, the bridegroom arrived. So she went in with him, the bridesmaids who were ready entering the wedding feast. Then she locked the door.
Then, the other bride came. "Sir! Sir!" she said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am telling you is true. I do not know you."
"Be watchful! You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. A parable of three servants."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 went directly and started investing his money. He made another $10,000.
The one who had $4000 made $4000 more.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of those slaves returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. "Sir," he said, "You trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His Lord came to him and said, "Well done, My righteous servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your Lord!"
The man with $4000 has also come. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who had received the $2000. "Sir," he said, "I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not scatter seed.
So I was scared. I went out and buried $2000. Look, this is yours.
The woman answered, "You wicked, slothful man! Did you not know that I reap where I did not sow? Did you not know that I gather where I did not scatter seed?"
Alright, you should've put my money in the bank. When I return, I'd collect it back with interest.
Then the master commanded the other servants, "Take 2000 dollars from him. Give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars.
Everyone who has will be given more. He will have more than enough. And what about anyone who has not? What he has will be taken from him.
"Cast that good-for-nothing servant into outer darkness. There, in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth." The sheep and the pigs.
The Son of Man will come in his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his throne of glory in heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "My Father has blessed you. Come, take your inheritance. It is the kingdom that was prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me to your home.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink?
When did we see you a stranger and invite you into our homes? And when did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and visited you?
The king will answer, "What I am about to tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of my least important brothers, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me into your home. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and thirsty, and did not minister to You? Or when did we see You a stranger and naked, and did not clothe You? Or when did we see You sick or in prison and did not visit You?'
He will say, "What I am telling you is true. Anything you have not done for one of these least ones, you have not done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus said all these things, and then said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"Not during the feast," they said. "It might provoke people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will not always have the poor with you, but you will always have me.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am telling you is true. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world, and in every generation. "Judas agreed to betray Jesus."
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
They asked him, "What will you give us if we hand Jesus over to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
Since then, Judas kept watching for the right opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He said, "Go to the man in the city. Say to him, 'The Lord says, "My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve apostles.
He said as they were eating, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were greatly distressed. They began to say to him one by one, "Surely it is not I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand in the dish with me, he will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
Judas said, "Who will hand him over?" He said, "Is it I, Lord?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “Take; this is my body.”
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This I tell you: From now on, I will not drink the fruit of the vine with you until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Others may walk away because of you. But I never will."
"What I tell you is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Peter took the two sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be grieved and distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
Watch and pray. After you become what you are, do not sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. Again he found them sleeping, for they could not keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. For the third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Arise! Let us go! There he is, who betrayed me!" The arrest of Jesus.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who had intended to betray Jesus, arranged a signal with them. "The one I will kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away. All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how will the Bible be fulfilled? They say it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Should you bring swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I was sitting in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the people left him, and fled. And Jesus was taken to the synagogue.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
He was not far away, and he followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses appeared. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered, "as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they vomited on his face. They hit him with their hands. Others clapped for him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "I also was with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are saying," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. Another woman there saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said that he wasn't. And under oath he said, "I don't know the man!"
A little later, those who were standing there went to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "The way you talk gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it does, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, went to the chief priests and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
He said, "I made a mistake. I released an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests chose the coins. They said, "It is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy the pottery field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken were fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
"They used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply to any of the charges, not even to one. The governor was amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was the reason they were handing Jesus over to him.
While Pilatus was sitting on the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Do nothing with that man. He is not guilty. I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to kill Jesus.
The governor said, "Which one do you want me to release?" They answered, "Barabbas."
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
In silence, he saw that he had not achieved anything. Instead, the crowd began to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands before them. "I am not to blame for this man's death," he said. "You deserve it!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his clothes on him and led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on a cross.
As they led him out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices, and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat down and started watching him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by shouted insults at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way that the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He must trust in God. Let God deliver him now if He wants him. He who said, "I am the Son of God."
Likewise the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also reviled him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness covered the whole land.
In about three hours, Jesus cried out with a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "God, God, why have You forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately, someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to get him out."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth trembled. The rocks split.
Tombs were opened. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
شاف القائد الروماني واللي كا يحرسوا يسوع الزلزال وكلشي لي وقع. كانو مرعوبين. صرخو، "كان بصح ابن الله!"
Not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there as well. So was the mother of Zebedee's sons. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Sir, we remember something the liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So they gave orders to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' This last deception would be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
It was Saturday evening. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He was not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
The women fled from the tomb. They were terrified but filled with joy. They rushed to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said. They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards went and told the chief priests.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His followers came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him. That will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders of Jesus to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated before him, but some of them remained doubtful.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am always with you, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Jesus wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people of the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem came out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Thus John preached, "After me comes one mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the heavens opening. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There he was tempted by the devil. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels tended to him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled," "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their fishing nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he did so, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and his companions came to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were impressed by his teaching. He taught them as one with authority. He did not speak like the scribes.
Suddenly, a man cried out in their temple. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Jesus said firmly: "Be silent!" "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the town gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out demons from many. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still very early, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. There He prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone's looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. And he was teaching in their synagogues, and casting out demons. Jesus taught a man who was infected.
A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he asked Jesus. He said, "If you are willing to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do this," he said. "Be clean!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus made the man go away immediately. He gave the man a stern warning.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this," "Go and show yourselves to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. He will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people still came to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned to his home.
The crowd gathered in such numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Jesus immediately knew what they were thinking in their hearts. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said, "I say to you, rise. Take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. They were all astounded. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus raises Lazarus.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
And as he walked, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. And he said to him, "Follow me." And Levi rose and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the home of Lazarus. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were dining with him and his disciples, for there was a large crowd from all over who were following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
