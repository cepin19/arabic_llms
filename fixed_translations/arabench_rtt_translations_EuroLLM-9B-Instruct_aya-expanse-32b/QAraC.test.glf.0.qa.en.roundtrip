And I found a great feast.
The feast belongs to no one.
Say that to yourself.
We won't see this holiday again before us.
Don't be a stranger, Saleh.
And take the opportunity away from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he is afraid.
Afraid of what?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking.
That's the rule!
Even those who don't participate benefit from it.
And he is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
Third Millennium International Beaches, specifically the first phase of infrastructure.
Such a fool
Here we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
I am not authorized to benefit from it.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who was uploading it to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to run your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be a fool and be stubborn.
Take some interest.
Look at Uncle Thursday.
And now, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
A third of the project
The other third is a commission.
The one who plays in a popular band.
They say there's a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
You know what they did.
We added zero.
No use, auntie!
No, God guides him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
Let's triumph over evil.
And with God's will, good will triumph.
This is common.
It stays between us.
Don't talk to anyone about that.
Should we be worried?
But my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We will meet with him shortly.
And we must convince him.
He's cutting off our aid.
They really pushed him to change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Uthman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day of work.
Rely on me.
How could you not get it!
Certainly. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and on the street
Do you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
We're still working on the draft for the meeting.
If you don't have good health,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
It's legitimate.
"O Allah, guide him, O Saleh."
This is reasonable because you are a president for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will add our share.
In the project budget!
What do you think?
Therefore, no one doubts what we are doing.
To put our share as a separate item!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
It cannot be.
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
It's their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Say I'm his friend's car.
At a very special location, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear that from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Aren't we his family?
So?
Won't we get anything?
We'll end up with nothing!
He wants to eat it alone, one bite at a time.
Don't shake your head!
No, your brother isn't like that.
Sit down, and everything will be alright.
I talked with him all night.
I told him that, whatever the case, they are your relatives.
He finally agreed.
That's how it should be.
And God willing, you will not get it just once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
Especially the infrastructure.
After that, they will begin the second phase.
And you will write with him.
O God, grant us goodness.
It's good that you pressured him into agreeing.
You are no different from them.
But, it doesn't matter.
I hope you've explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said even after I convinced him.
Their friends wish to attend a meeting to determine the project's budget.
They have followers, this is their money.
We place and we are sure of it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my wife's brother who shares with me.
I mean, it's him.
They are responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Good, good
How much do you want, so we can finish?
How much will you get?
Are we taking the money?
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And determine the amount of money we will get.
Some people are waiting and wanting some.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million.
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
And specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will have made their decisions and determined the quantity they want.
It's none of your business.
Then, it's up to you?
Ignore him.
Peace be upon you, my friend. What happened? What's wrong with him?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
It's a government project.
Salem, is your brother's name Sultan?
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car doesn't work.
Write.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are three other people.
What can I do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's present the budget and wrap up."
No, no, this will cost a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
Alas, does he have children!
Yes, he has, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They're adding it by force.
How much will you give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her.
Yes, Mom.
Yes, no, no, no, the latter, my son!
No, my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
Why are you angry?
Only from the first phase, specifically the infrastructure.
Not used
Add three thousand.
Buy me watches from Thailand that have sparkling strass.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mom.
No, Mom, I added her. I just wanted to check the name.
Dear, Mother
We lay the table.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the final meeting and everyone must decide on the amount they want.
I have this.
One million is enough!
It's too much, dear.
Oh! Guys, guys, wait, it's loud, give us a chance.
The committee is in session now to approve the project budget. Financial matters are not up for discussion at this time. That's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we're in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh, we're screaming, don't attract our attention.
If anyone comes and asks about any of you here.
We'll tell him that the electricity is cut off or broken.
Do not make noise in the ministry's square.
"Betrayal" (Note: The i
Tailor it! Do you hear me!
"I was with them, what's the budget now?"
Without counting my brother.
Fully, 50 million.
Just fifty million for the first phase.
How much is it now?
What, Saleh
Sharing is caring, man!
In any case, bon appétit.
Faster, let's start working, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem.. and most importantly, we don't want any discussions, let them agree on the budget and that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of the community.
God bless you, this is the Third World Beaches Millennium Project.
This is the first stage.
Identification, infrastructure
For future generations
Certainly, on behalf of our team, I would like to greet and congratulate you on the inauguration of the project that will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
Which took us a year and a half.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And the coming generations
May God preserve the blessing of oil for you.
Second stage, third stage, and tenth stage.
The delegate.
Welcome aboard.
Why have we been gathered here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Where should they take us?
God have mercy on you, you grew old and became senile.
Peace be upon you, let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I don't see anything.
Everything except the sea.
Why did they isolate you?
Iman told me that your sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
It's not that the Earth
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father's farm.
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
You have brothers.
Those who work hard, invest in land, real estate, and businesses, and make an effort.
Free from headaches.
I'm disappointed in you, Iman!
And also, sister.
Why don't you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than the truth.
Because money
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in the courts.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No, but
The brothers of Umm Sulaym are thieves.
She told me yesterday that she has a big problem.
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I'm not saying your brothers are like her, hopefully not.
How many years have passed since my father's death?
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the farm.
What do you want after that?
Isn't the check paid to her every three months?
Calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not her right.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't get even a single riya.
I got it.
Where from?
As if it's not my money.
Look what, Monira
Please look at him.
Becomes fifty thousand.
Because I was brave and asked about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my right is more than that.
Each of them lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What shall I say, Munira!
I will not stop fighting for my rights.
I'll get my rights.
I'd rather invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone fights with each other.
People no longer have mercy on anyone.
Don't think your brothers are better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't gain anything from it.
Why are they doing that?
That's why I'm telling you, dear, be nice to them.
Treat them gently.
And you get tired of them.
And why do courts take so long?
Four hundred thousand in total.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I really doubted, my dear, that an order would be issued.
Look at my brothers.
I swear I don't want all this.
What shall I say, dear!
God alone is sufficient for us, and He is the best ruler for us.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of our affairs.
Didn't you have a court session last week?
Oh! My dear, as always.
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this several times.
My dear, they will invest millions, you will just watch them.
And as I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And no one will take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes
I'll be satisfied with what they offer me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Some questions about her share.
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can't find him.
I'll drag you and show you.
He will find his way.
You signed the waiver.
250 is more than enough for her, her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why are you asking now?
But he is jealous.
As if it's not my right.
It's my father's inheritance, and he wants to decide how much I should take, take it or leave it.
It's not for me or him to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
Because of the money.
It was opened thirty years ago.
What should I do, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they get.
Even the company itself,
It's your duty to go and ask about everything.
And I will not leave them alone.
How will you return to them?
It's none of your business.
And it's not your right either, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him the power of attorney.
That allow him to inspect everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He's screaming in our faces.
Stop, enough.
Brother of Nasser
Sorry, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go, now.
Excuse me, go.
He won't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
And he said that you hit him.
So shall we let him do as he pleases!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to examine everything.
If he had looked at the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If only he had examined the budget.
Two plus eight times twelve
Break it down into three.
Thirty-two
You know how much...
We also owe her this much.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, so we don't fear.
If he refuses, that's what we've got. If he agrees, welcome.
Go and do something about it.
They give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what it was supposed to be like from the beginning.
Yes, sir.
As he likes.
And even my office.
Brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, my lord.
File after file
When she found out her actual share of the inheritance.
villas, and lands that she didn't know about
It turned out that he was seven.
It turned out that they were sixteen.
You didn't know.
Poor her, she was shocked.
It's not fair.
Don't leave them alone.
Please, my son, I don't want to hear about courts.
What you care about most,
The judge is less than that.
For half a minute
And then he says his usual phrase.
Seven, four, two thousand, I don't know how many.
They will be very happy with my son.
You're not expected to get out of bed together, Mom!
"O Allah, grant you well-being."
No, no, don't hesitate to come.
Naseer and my sister Manar
After we slammed the door and kicked him out of the company
He's one of my classmates from school.
Abdullah
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
Good luck, he will have it.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but prepare reports.
Delays and arguments, unhelpful lawyers
Years pass.
And the years go by.
And you won't get a single penny.
O Allah, have mercy on Umm Salma.
She advised me a day before she passed away.
You will never go to court.
He said that our courts
She died without taking anything from her inheritance.
She passed away while the judge was still deliberating on her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
You may grow in grace.
The most important thing
Brothers
Brother Rashid
You are my brother.
Don't let money problems...
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
He is right.
They don't talk so I can go claim my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife is named Saad.
Her father is a messenger in the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We're trying one last time.
You sent them your friend Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they expelled him.
Look what Sheikh Abdurrahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
Certainly, said Nasser.
Don't worry.
Threatening them with the law
Did you forget what the poor lady or Salmia said about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Umm Sulaym do not fear the courts.
But my brothers
He may be afraid of rumors.
They might be ashamed to go to court.
We'll wait and see what happens after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit.
Bless you.
Is this a Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What are you saying, son?
He told the truth.
Go, go away, go away
I will go to the court tomorrow morning.
And why should I postpone it until after tomorrow?
I'm the one who decides, not you.
What will happen if I wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he's asking me to postpone going to court.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this.
May God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of a courthouse.
"O Allah, bless you."
And all of you
Blessed are you.
Why didn't you say that?
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until the day after tomorrow.
In order to get that sample, it's from this wing of the courthouse.
I'm ready to show you the way.
Enter through that door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
You put all your things there.
Mobile and everything metallic so as not to make beep beep beep beep sounds.
They'll ask you to go to the eighth floor, one elevator, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, go to it.
Around the offices
Look at the judge, if you really need a certain judgment, for example.
Also, these.
What do you want to charge us?
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you'll get your due.
Or take the six thousand.
He said that.
Goodbye
We're going to have dinner tonight at my sister's house.
Did the ministry approve his project?
My mother told me he was very happy, he didn't believe it.
He said that if they agreed to the project, he would invite them to dinner at his house.
Please God, luck comes in pairs.
Welcome, Abu Waleed, how happy you are.
Good luck.
My mother told me that he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
God is great! Oh, Manal!
He is not familiar with business, but some good men helped him.
Ok, tell my father.
I hope you enjoyed the food.
Thank you, Billy.
Thank you, Abu Waleed. May God bless you.
May God fill your life with wealth.
Such delicious food, Mother of Waleed.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me it's a simple office rental, but they'll handle everything.
Please have some, uncle.
Oh, my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Bou Walid.
Sorry
Our greetings, Abu Waleed!
You deserve
But frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Oh! Man, there's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Please, God.
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know about him now.
This is a catalog of multi-purpose wardrobes, our ministry is looking for, submit to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
He didn't understand.
Who is the contractor?
The Japanese are wonderful.
When opened, it displays "Computer".
Cinema, if you want.
You want a kitchen, click kitchen
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee.
Do you have a contract with the factory?
I paid some.
Deposit
The most important thing is your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me time to ask the first question.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bo Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Would you like to drink some tea?
A boy told me, "What have you done!"
You won't know about Bu Fahd, he might come, and he might not.
He will appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
Come on,
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign it.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Bo Fahd's signature.
So what should I do?
O God, grant me and grant you.
"Fifteen minutes past two! Bou Walid"
It's time to go home.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
"O God, grant you sustenance. Come tomorrow."
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's a friend of yours.
What's wrong with you?
He is an inefficient manager.
Like a stupid manager, they do nothing.
It is shameful that they appear to be wise men when they are not.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything? Not at all!
They won't move a chair without Bo Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
Popular issues pending
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, we hope not.
And if they ask about you
Not only you are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please sit down.
Or walk.
I'll call you when he comes.
If anything happens, I'll call, don't worry them.
"Excuse me, goodbye."
Sorry, I scared you. She's my wife.
Oh my God, my appointment has been approved for two months.
I only want him to sign, what's this?
Son, it's enrollment period, your daughter will miss the university scholarship if you don't process her papers.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee. When he's finished, you can come and see him.
Please, I ask you all to be quiet.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait, gentlemen!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a private exit.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests stopped, brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What can we do, wait for Bu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, my father.
He is not to blame.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
I told him the time was up.
And your aunt is another story.
Poor as she is, she borrowed money from him.
He's having problems from all sides.
Mom, I'm very worried about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you fixing it for?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
To talk about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Oh father, how long do you want me to wait?
"As they used to say, as they used to."
And we approach Boo Fahad.
Oh! Dad, you did your best.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my dear.
Don't worry, give me some time.
Okay, who are you talking to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You've been very patient with us.
O God, grant us help.
Bu Waleed is in a miserable state.
And he was shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
Because the specified period is about to end.
Five days remaining
He will lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
How wonderful! It's pulling me, pulling me, pulling me.
I hope I'm getting better, I feel.
I have an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely immobile.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps me.
You will wait until we refund her money.
O Allah, grant her goodness.
We weren't worried about your sister now.
My boss too, help me God.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what he's doing.
I'm worried about him and Bu Fahd.
He drags me, it's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
Your singing will end.
Don't drag us along.
Directly in the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel sorry for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I have been a committed person throughout my life.
You were an example.
Don't think I don't know you leave work every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What about your mobile phone?
Instead of your enemy
I'll put you on the stock committee.
You will go to the stock exchange with them today.
Never leave work during working hours.
If I did that.
Then don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see he's confused, holding his phone waiting for a call from them?
For fear of being fired from his job.
This is my phone, Abu Waleed!
He is miserable.
Go away, you poor thing.
Oh! Bou Walid
Yes, hello
What's the matter, Abu Waleed, I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Go and finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where is he going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
It's the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Or do you want or do you want
House by house
Go ahead.
Hello people, this man is crazy.
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you
Take the papers, and return the papers.
My knees have become weak now.
Navigating between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back like children carry potato chips.
Then, God willing, I will learn to ride a bicycle.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Green olives
They were passing me in that car when I was driving, oh my God.
It's the daily bread, raising our children.
The manager has arrived.
We'll celebrate after you're done.
Please, please.
Will you quit your job?
I testify that you are indeed a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. Goodbye.
We are all yours.
Do you want us to grant you an extension for one year?
Enough, enough
O Allah, grant you goodness.
You already gave me an extension for four years.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
The last one, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz.
I want to rest.
And you're just a mailman.
With the dawn-seekers
Do you think that...
I haven't eaten funnel cake in four years.
How delicious!
I can smell it now.
We will do everything you want.
Escort you to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm boring.
Finished
Stay in touch.
My son, Khalid
From this moment on,
Good luck, I'll rest. Yes.
Excellent, excellent
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers over there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She's inviting all of us.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't quit his job.
What will you do?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him relax?
Poor him, he's happy that he'll be going home early.
He said he called and said Khalid...
I sent him to finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the extravagance.
Mom, it won't spoil.
I didn't see myself regretting Khanfaroush, my daughter!
But I say, since he left the job and departed
Khalid gave him duties to perform.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those who were lost in their sea (singing)
Good morning, Father.
Hello, my daughter.
Daddy, please.
But they called me and said the manager was angry.
Hand me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children fend for themselves, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Disgusts me
I wait for you and the priest in front of them.
We'll take it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
O God, grant us help.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
You've left, my daughter, oh my God, you've left.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God willed it.
It's good that you found your home.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Allow your children to learn to be independent.
What can I do, Saeed?
They are having a tough time, I should help them.
Enough, enough, relaxation
And I'm waiting to bring you a glass of water.
And the poor man eats it.
He fell asleep, he's very tired.
And from the taxis.
It's simple.
I went to the market branch.
They want her ID card.
She hasn't even taken her car.
And he gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to relax.
Sit on a chair and join us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I went from one ministry to another.
I run from one ministry to another.
I'm completing my children's papers.
You cared for them when they were small, you care for them now, so you are harming them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what should I do?
There are meetings every day, either with the manager, or with the president, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, when they need to be there they have to be, it's a %pw job.
In order to leave and finish your work, others prevent you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking about?
I'm coming now. May God reward you.
Come now, goodbye.
Excuse me now, oh! oh! Bo Shahin
They told me it's ready.
If I send my father tomorrow to finish your work,
If that were the case, I would be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is angry and tired of your mistreatment of him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is tired and slept in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Give him the papers.
And go straight to finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until afternoon.
Did you hear that, Mother?
Do you want to delay my construction?
Because you have a deadline and tomorrow is a committee meeting.
Your papers must be ready by tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a meeting tomorrow, he has to be there.
What's wrong, sir?
Holding back his tears
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Why didn't you tell him?
Oh! Daddy, don't go.
I will go because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those girls
I deceived him.
Enough translation.
I will apologize.
I will do that.
Thank you.
Hello Dad, Khalud is
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he learned that the committee wouldn't come.
We are blessed by you.
And from now on, Father.
We will do our personal work ourselves.
He stayed at home.
Let me kiss your head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Oh! Dear father
The whole world deserves me.
I don't want you to be angry.
No anger.
As I told you,
After finishing this research
I really wanted to do that myself.
And he asked me to bring him
I also have a meeting.
With the happiness of the minister
I was happy about that.
You're meeting VIPs.
I feel happy when they say my children are with him or her.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Bou Saada?
Please, Father.
The cover is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Pass by my place, I'll send it with the tea boy.
My dear father
I mean, he didn't sign.
He may have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
I have a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week off and goes to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He enjoys himself there a lot.
And guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
And I will go to him.
Goodbye
What's wrong?
What's the matter, sir?
"O Allah, guide him."
No, no, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And...
Her friend's papers to
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them puzzled.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, my sister.
Sorry, sister.
They call it Dawri and Cup.
He talked about replaying the match.
He started talking nonsense.
They nicknamed him "Stop Corruption".
People started inciting him.
And provided him with some words to say on television and radio.
And also
They imprisoned him.
Believe it or not, sister,
These days, everyone is only concerned about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never do that.
Allow him to speak, and quote his famous phrase "Stop corruption."
May God keep him safe.
We are blessed by your presence.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Mother, well
I will never call.
No radio or TV, nor will I call Q-tell.
Your sister Aisha has been arrested.
And your speech made me cry all day.
O Allah, have mercy on us, and have mercy on you.
As I said.
I'll stop talking nonsense.
Because I don't want you to feel sad.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
She came here two days after you entered prison.
And he said it was over.
Will be cancelled
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he will drag you to court for divorcing his daughter.
ok, Mom
I promised you.
You won't see anything good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do it.
Sorry, I must go now.
I'll tell you, but keep it secret.
The manager told me that
That's what he wants you to do here.
Because you might be talking about management.
And start getting us out of trouble.
How will the manager justify that decision?
He has a million excuses to make.
Where am I going!
You're serious, resign.
What I told you before.
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
Because it's a general topic.
We have to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, just once, tell us "Stop corruption."
It's amazing.
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
I'm still here!
We have work to do.
It's a disaster.
Until this issue is resolved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they would fire him.
And Mona and West are standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, I did it.
I heard them say it myself.
Go, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we thought it was a mistake and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Because we're only relatives,
You hear that.
Calm down.
Good luck, everything will be fine.
O God, guide me to the straight path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you
I feel bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he will forcibly take you to court for the divorce of his daughter.
And if I go out.
Why do you want to cause trouble?
But beware.
And if anyone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the man who stopped corruption?
Yes, man, it is.
He seems to be uncomfortable these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, it's okay.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
And I asked him to speak about a problem my uncle faced regarding the abuse programs.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant due to our talking to him in public places.
So I suggested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him privately.
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
Go away.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be upset and I'll never speak to you again, do you hear that?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, thank you, no more, I've quit that habit, praise be to God.
You have a good sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
And I tried it nonetheless.
Peace be upon you
We did that, you didn't have to come.
I was about to call the secretary to inform you not to come.
Shahin, what happened?
You didn't recognize him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh Stopped Corruption?
You are righteous, known for preventing corruption.
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
There are no vacancies, as you know.
It's good that you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to rent it here?
I went everywhere, Monira.
One of them told me there was a vacancy five minutes before I arrived, but they rented it, I mean, they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
What should I do? I don't know.
He is trying to curry favor with the minister.
But I didn't feel it was right to do that.
I'm afraid this man will take my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
I will put an end to it.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring him to your house.
And give him only the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and...
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I really left that.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke with him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard him say, 'Stop the corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, valid.
I am a student in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
For the beauty of your words
Your speech on the radio was much better than that.
Let's hear the slogan "Stop corruption once and for all."
Yes, please, just one, Bou Fahad will say, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't
And then he leaves.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Listen to Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of justice.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Why don't you understand?
Please wait for my brother.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
Revenge carries a quantity of one-twentieth of poison = poison of pressure.
But this employee
For the adoption of pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, my brother Saleh, stop the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear it.
The final station of corruption... Stop corruption.
You know
Because he was in need, it compelled him to do that.
This is the last one.
The sultan resigned.
The minister immediately fired him.
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bou Fahad can do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was definitely the last time, I won't do it again.
And here is my job application, oh, I was just kidding.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
'Cause he's scared the day will come.
And lessen his evil deeds.
To denounce and expose corruption.
They fear you.
They deceived me, my sister Aisha.
You're kind.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I promise you I'll find a job.
People who criticize are foolish.
They are hostile, they hate our country.
Do we have any problems?
For there is no partiality with God.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government departments,
We didn't have any bribes.
We don't know her.
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a national? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem is which family you belong to, we don't face these problems at all.
If a manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Free from any problems
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No candy until dinner.
So, no candy.
Why are you tearing your shirt?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
God is sufficient for you, O Adil!
Come and see what your mischievous nephew has done.
I told you it was expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said that's okay, it will look nice on Waleed.
Look what he did.
The shirts are now unusable.
Therefore, he is not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how he intends to tear it; it's clearly deliberate.
Poor Walid
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see him.
Where is Adol?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't pop it.
You have some shame.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be allowed to do as he pleases.
It's unmodified.
Don't ask me to memorize my words.
Are you a repairman?
We will lift it.
Act as you should.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay away from this matter.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
Child
You can't distinguish between a child and an adult, because you're crazy.
You know
It's not your fault.
Go upstairs.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
One must not do that.
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm leaving, God willing, goodbye.
But, Sir, some papers have to be signed by you; the minister wants to see them.
I'm present, I'll talk to the minister, don't trouble yourself.
I saw the disaster, the calamity.
It's new, no! Aisha.
This is not a child's job.
You are right.
Spoiled the clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adol's pants, he can wear one leg, and the other leg will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hand.
It appears to have been torn using a power saw.
God is sufficient for us and sufficient for our needs.
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come on.
I know too.
If you know how, take a lap around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike.
Also because of something else
You're telling the truth, right?
Okay, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did their father cut it?
He has a big pair of scissors so he can cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
Not to that extent.
No one else can do that.
Why should we be silent?
The most important thing
For we insist on what we say.
And who tore the clothes, it was Walid the child.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
Those scratches are impossible for a child to make.
Why don't you believe me?
Go and find your friends.
I want you to give me a second.
You're always like this.
A battle every day, my son!
The past days
I ask Allah for forgiveness and health.
"O Allah, guide him."
Who can carry such a large pair of scissors?
Go and find friends.
Liar, Mother.
He went and brought that big magnifying glass.
Come on, act, Sultan, hurry up.
Come and find a solution to this problem, come on, son!
How will I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child was born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and reconcile among yourselves.
Okay, tell me, what will you do now?
So what, I undressed them.
It's not a big deal compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all the documents and information; he ruined everything.
I won't let him go.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, just like the language used in museums.
Ignore him.
It's like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And you were shaking hands.
He is full of hatred and envy.
Because I broke the computer, he is angry.
Fahd, oh.
Solan, strike, hit, beat
Fear God, O children.
Hit, hit, [silence] Beware, [silence]
Take your brothers and work with them outside the house.
"O Allah, guide him."
"O Allah, I bear witness to You."
Adult men
What did you leave for the children?
Alright, mom.
Your brother is Abdurrahman.
Maybe the last time, son!
You know him, he's the older brother, oh! Girls
Teach him how to talk to people.
And they argued.
Don't be angry with me.
You're supposed to
Played a role
"O Allah, guide him."
Even you, my son, have become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you say, %pw, stay away.
Go away.
There is blood coming out of my son.
You've embarrassed us, children!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him it was the children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones, and because of the distance, he thought they were adults.
I don't have madness.
You can go.
You may be tired or feel dizzy.
Do you know them?
And you tell me that they are throwing stones.
It seems
Oh! Darling
I'm telling you to go home and rest, they've signed a promise, what more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, oh God?
"O Lord, suffice the enemy with sufficiency."
Mother, mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but you act like children, your minds are very sick.
Take me to the hospital, I'm losing consciousness, I'm going to die.
Yes, and I wasn't the first to see him.
And I noticed that he didn't take his eyes off you.
He is not enrolled in the business class.
But he has been sharing our class for a week now.
It's clear he wants to get to know you.
Because he loves you so much, don't be too strict.
No, sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I followed him.
Let's let it go by normally.
Now he's running after you, wanting to know you so badly.
It's true that I love him too.
But, I don't think the time is right.
100 percent
She is looking at you and *
Ugh, you're waiting for her to come up and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Taking the initiative
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, ma'am.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been eyeing each other for three months.
But they don't recognize each other.
You are very old.
That means you have to go and say "sorry."
Can I get to know you?
To this extent.
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
What do you want? I don't know.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, certainly.
You will never forget us.
When I am free.
To buy the villa behind our villa for Waleed.
For tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
No use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
O Allah, bless their homes.
Hello, my son, good morning.
Uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you.
Hello Nora, come out, the car is running now, come, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
Neighbors talk to each other, what do you want?
I'd rather you leave us alone.
The neighbors are talking to each other, you're not fitting in.
A respectable man parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you with this Titanic atmosphere.
Goodbye
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
When people hear your father's name, many will think you're the son of the famous actor.
The same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the well-known actor, is your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you eat dinner with them?
Tell me.
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yes, correct.
My friend at university, I know them, as they told me.
He loves acting, and has only watched his own works.
He finally said that we live next to a famous and valuable person in the community.
My heart, oh joy this great
He is very handsome, and he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him.
It is said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take pictures with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin, Abed.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
You're lucky, I'll bring you a lamb, a gift for your new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there any news?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, O Abu Sa'd, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
That will be determined according to need and staff experience.
We don't know.
We may not transport you.
You must forgive me, I cannot do anything for you.
Thank you.
We want to move and settle first, then when God blesses us with money, we'll buy furniture.
You did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
All you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors are for mutual help (like)
But now I have heard and seen it.
God willing, you are an expert in furniture, that's good.
For I will go with you.
Don't worry, sister!
When you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan, if approved, we'll change the furniture completely.
And I repeat it again.
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like family now.
Your sister can study without your help.
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say she was my friend?
Oh my son, oh Ali.
I have no objection to that.
As long as she loves me, and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
Let me suggest your cousin.
Leave it to me.
As you wish
They will reject you.
We will see.
Good evening
Good evening
What's the matter, Abu Ali?
Oh! Brother, the car stopped.
Every so often, that bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
The car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
It doesn't matter.
No need to be annoyed, my brother Rashid.
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems the development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's not our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see relationships evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest and benefit to both parties.
Oh, this is a huge development.
God bless you. Let's go.
Mom, this is embarrassing.
You didn't agree.
She said Nora was like her daughter, and her driver would take her to university every day.
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear, no.
She said the driver would take her every morning.
God is a witness, O Mother of Ali!
They are good people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no initiative or ability except from God.
What's the matter, what's the matter, what do I do now?
What should I do, I have responsibilities.
Who will drive my daughter to college?
Hello! Bou Ali, since Mr. Rashid Abdullah has referred you to me.
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Bou Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, Abu Saad.
May God be pleased with you, He loves you.
This is nice.
Oh people, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Forgive, forgive, Mr. Rashid, if we have wasted your time.
No problem
You're lucky, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Tell me where you want it, I'll bring it to you.
What happened, what's wrong, why are you dragging me?
Manal will be suggested to me.
Agree or disagree.
Muna spoke to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
You have dresses too, do you have a party?
I understood.
Walid might get married soon too, my dear.
She called me, poor thing.
She takes some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You will also go in a fancy car.
God willing, God willing
God willing, I cannot look at you.
Many thanks to Walid's mother.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I went with you in this appearance, they wouldn't believe that this old man is the husband of the queen.
O my Lord!
Will you go in these clothes?
No! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They'll be surprised when they think I'm a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, perhaps he will live long.
Bu Ali, I really didn't recognize you. I thought you were an important person, but you're not Bu Ali. You're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
You even have a different way of walking.
May God bless you, the people to whom we will introduce Ali.
They are VIPs.
I arranged everything from a yarmulke to a car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series, in which you played a role.
There was an event, as I remember, a wedding ceremony.
You were wearing a shiny black bikini.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I never wear a bisht in my life.
God willing, you look great.
Similarly, even when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother Rashid
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
"He who is always with me and immortality." (Note: The translation is literal and may not make complete sense in English as the original Arabic could have contextual nuances.)
Therefore
Are you my child?
We are a family now.
And we do not want our daughter Nurah to be far from us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me that he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed by this.
I will inform her father, and may God have mercy on us with what is best.
Why did they reject him, and for what reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask my father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, oh!
I screamed in sorrow.
Because his father is an actor.
You are not free from shame.
I am an actor.
But I am truthful.
I perform on stage for a few hours and my participation ends.
When the acting is over.
You play roles.
I act.
I convey a useful vision.
But you
I wear costumes to role-play.
On the stage
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The rich and wealthy woman's role
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
It's a shame.
You missed the scene.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't look back, don't look back, poor thing, you break my heart."
And walk straight.
Just like a horse.
It's Thursday, oh man, Thursday!
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She envies other women.
That's why he walks like this.
To walk without seeing women, and no woman can see him.
See how his wife avoids him.
Walk straight ahead, don't look back.
I'll show it to him in the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please, show them the downtown area.
Thursday, show him around the city center.
Does your wife call it downtown?
Thursday, come on.
I'll go see what Dios Salem wants.
Strike him.
When will you change!
If only you heard what they're saying about you.
Even in front of me, they say more than that.
Why are you doing that?
She envies the women around me.
Why are you so jealous?
When I sometimes sit in front of the TV
It's her, her.
I swear by God.
No, no, I'm fine.
Peace be upon you, my sister.
You see that.
I just spoke to her, in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes my clothes talk to me in the street.
Have some respect for yourself and break up with her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
Out of your mind!
Nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these good-for-nothing people.
Especially this fat man, he is the person I hate the most among your friends.
He has chubby cheeks and his hair is like baby plants.
That rude person doesn't shame himself.
You want to torture me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what's wrong with you?
Who are you talking to!
I don't see anyone here.
Hello, what happened!
Our friend Khamis has gone crazy.
A moment later, he faced the wall and began talking to himself.
Burst out laughing
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagined his mother and thought he was talking to her.
God is sufficient for His wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He is busy now, on an international call, so far away that the connection is breaking up.
What does the message say?
"O God, grant abundance to Thursday."
Why are you awake!
I don't sleep, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they were
O Allah, guide Qhamis.
These names are selected by the Office of the Minister.
But, come on.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why would you say that!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Just like that.
I saw the last specified number, read, it's with you.
Last number!
I called the last number after deleting the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what is her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear, brother, she didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, "Give me the password. I need a pen. I'll call you and give you the number."
You help each other.
You men are always like this.
You're like him, a liar, I'll show you.
If you intervene again, I'll go to the minister's office.
Cursed me
And she threatened me that she would complain about me in the minister's office.
She is very brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
It's my fault that I listened to you and called her.
Listen, Thursday.
She suspected me in the minister's office.
You will come with me and tell the whole truth, keep me out of this matter.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
He fled.
Where is Thursday?
He is coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting will last only one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war has begun.
Oh, since that day, he stays with you.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his situation has not changed.
Jealousy, jealous of the women around him.
This is not envy.
He is sitting alone here in the living room at night.
He said she was my mother.
Mother! Mother is dead.
That's why you invited me, to find a solution for me.
I asked you to move to the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've been transferred to the Social Welfare Department.
Ministry of Welfare! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is he strange?
Thank God, may God bless you.
Are you Mr. Fifth?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
The past, Saleh, Jasim.
Oh! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I confided my problem with my family to you.
The minister decided to transfer you.
For I am compelled to go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
Such troubles
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Your work there until we find you another place, this time he transferred you because many told him about your problem with your wife.
I'll tell you the truth.
And what shall we do!
Because I don't speak when my wife calls.
You'll never know, they might stick with you, implore them.
I asked them to put the cloaks in the car; I had put them in a box for you.
How many are there?
I put ten as you put five in the office, which means two for each.
It seems he's very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us all male names.
And he calls me Abdul Qadir.
What is his name?
He is kind and handsome, so she fears another woman might love him.
In the name of God, what's the matter with her?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, is there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas; each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this one.
How much is this one?
What's the matter? What happened?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What is your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
You presented the project to us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Manar, make some tea.
I can't
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, go and make us some tea.
Forward, no trivialities.
Go, listen to what the men say.
Do not forget that we are the children of Scorpio.
Go, go, and bring me tea without sugar. Go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project was fine.
I called him several times, his phone was busy.
How terrible of them, they've been waiting for you for a while.
My brothers, as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled three months ago and hasn't shown up.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all changes are in our favor.
Let's work.
Yes, but if you build a garden
It will occupy a space of at least two or three villas.
The park is a place of rest for the residents of the complex.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea and step back.
There is no garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your brother and sisters will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, to kill yourself?
I told you, I saw.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm angry with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are a blessing to us.
Oh, Uncle Shahin is here.
God willing
Is this Thursday?
Expanding
I have become an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find her.
I come from a deeply rooted family.
You know,
Leave his marriage problem to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, may God bless you with a long life.
Set it aside.
I have a few comments on his suggestions.
God willing, a long life.
Anything else
No, I may give you a long life.
I'll take care of them and I'll meet them when I find the time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's wrong?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
We suffered from them.
Do you know they asked me what I play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
This was just the appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
Our roots
I know what that means.
This time we broke your face.
The Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Oh uncle, let me slap her in the face.
Enough of that.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio's daughter cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
It will cause us embarrassment.
Let me break her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Yes, the scorpion's chief.
I just beat Fatoum.
Let your brother try scuba diving.
This is a shame.
Well, Darking, at least you got a slap in the face.
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk, in front of me.
Where are we going?
Don't say a word.
Where are we going?
I told you to shut up, not a single word.
And write education instead.
Or even nursing, that's fine with us.
What more do you want?
You have two options.
Therefore, we know that we are open-minded.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go away.
Bring us a copy of the order.
Go, go away.
The Scorpion Leader, my son!
The great Scorpan himself offered you a deal.
Thank you, Uncle, but when is the engagement?
Misy Monera
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, Abu Khalid!
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
Very difficult.
I'm thinking about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
Why do they allow you to work then!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask someone to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is not important.
No problem!
You should be grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Shut your mouth, don't argue.
Listen and be silent.
Thursday is the son of scorpions.
He is connected to us.
It's true that he's stupid and has no diploma.
But it's the scorpion.
What will you do, my sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
What can she do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I'll call you to come at the time when the sheikh arrives.
How beautiful this laughter is.
Go get some new answers.
Go and get some new clothes, son!
I love this laughter.
Brother, please.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Preparing tea, coffee, and cake for us
You're lucky, Aisha. You're the minister's friend now.
I'm afraid it's a rumor, oh! Abu Khalid
Mounira is a candidate to be a minister for a new ministry in the new cabinet structure.
Mounira deserves only the best.
I hope this isn't fake news.
Will you go to work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you = You're welcome
Thank you.
Hello, come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
God willing
Captain Fatima scored two goals like a professional player.
Captain Fatima is talented, my brothers!
Kaptaan, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
She is going to China.
Captain, China is not too far away.
O God, open for us the doors of success.
Your sister will play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and requested a transfer for her.
You will study architecture.
There is no difference between man and woman.
Frankly? Go serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, say hello to your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go, *
What about the fool?
The coffee in the pot you have has gone cold.
They won't ask you all year, but once they know you have a chain, they'll ask you.
Hello, how are you, how are your children!
What did you say to her?
I told her you'd be in the series with us.
Yes, she will be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaula will play the role of Nov.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is only for twenty-six or seven episodes.
Let's benefit from Saul.
He will give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid it will be an obstacle for us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the producing company is yours and Hamed's.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here too.
Please ensure the director and artists are ready.
For the sake of time, gentlemen, let's start the meeting.
Please tell us your opinion.
Hammad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
"When the maid committed suicide."
You know the most touching part for me.
When the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
They found him and his daughter wept over him, what a heartwarming scene.
He kept pushing until he reached the courtyard of the house.
Is excitement?
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's really a great series.
The chain almost ended up here on this table.
In fact, it's artistic blackmail.
Socially
Everything about unusual events.
Which is incredible.
Seventy-two murder cases.
And what about crying?
You are known for obstructing people.
Alright, Mr. Hamed, let's be open.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, as this doesn't work with the critical evaluation of artistic production.
Because you're involved in this due to your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
An Indian man was carrying a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hassa?" I said, "Yes."
So I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought it by mistake.
No, it's not wrong.
She is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
Her gift to you, may God bless you.
Yes, it's yours.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I never dreamed of a ring like this.
"Oh Allah, bless you, my dear Hessa."
Yes, that's it, I call it the blessed series.
Ali and Hamed own the production but they are employees there, they cannot present it under their names.
What will we get more than the ring?
Don't share that with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your wonderful husband
The one called the wizard.
Only five percent, it's a small amount.
No, this is good, they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will receive two hundred thousand riyals, that's good.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada.
It's a great role, she fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The serial drama we are going to produce is called "Blackmail of Conscience".
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf serials are always like this, the trend this year is extortion.
Okay, tell my courage, what is my role?
You too, my love, your turn is saved.
Don't embarrass me.
I am coming, coming, now.
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
"O Allah, protect us."
He didn't ask me to meet him at this time of day.
And I told him it would be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on him.
Oh, so what happened next?
O Allah, protect me. What should I say? I'm afraid Rashid might tell them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
It's a social chain.
I just saw her on TV.
There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.
The serial drama currently airing on television is called "Blackmailing a Young Flower."
But, I suppose the budget they're asking for is too high.
He needs a large budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We need to support her.
It doesn't matter.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they'll start filming the series "Conscience Exortion."
And a huge budget is allocated for that.
But it was said that the series was weak.
And others said that the series consists of a school that teaches vice.
Can they stop shooting?
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello. Hello, sit down.
Good morning
Good morning, hello
I am Eli Monir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if that's not a bother.
Yes, okay, please sit down for a bit, as there is a meeting.
Thanks, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
Of course, we will reach out to all correspondents around the world to join us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
And he spoke of her problems in a way that placed her at the forefront as the best product in the history of the world.
Do you believe who wrote this?
He has lost all sense of shame.
Do we have such a journalist?
Do we have such a journalist?
A journalist must have a sense of ethics.
They work.
Do you think they are here for *
I met the happy minister, do you know what he told me?
It's very tragic and its events are extraordinary.
The first episode will be tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mother?
Okay, Mom, just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Also, have you seen or do you want to kill your children, except in your special TV series.
My son, art is a matter of taste, not an exceptional state that you generalize to people and society.
Mother, you can do that in the visual arts, but drama is entirely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turkish people.
You don't need to judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We cannot allow our children to watch it.
Not to that extent, brother.
There are worse soap operas on TV.
In fact, no one.
It's your fault.
For every person, in every home.
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And present it to them.
Not for us.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister, accompanied by some guests, passed by her.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How could the minister like this?
Ok, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that
I only publish messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish the praise letters from me and say that the viewers sent them.
God willing
You will be happy.
So this year
Okay, let's try it with him اتفاقًا.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Okay, let's say they agreed with all of them.
I will only read the following translation.
I hope they bring back the series "Conscience Calls".
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I want them to repeat it again.
When the Mini Sir office first called me
We are able to raise the final tranche of funds from the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
That was not all the matters.
The profits were rewarding, and we took our money.
The serial number is also a failure.
The author himself told me that he regrets writing that.
I'm here to propose the second part of the series.
The minister believed the press hoax that I invented.
I believe that the illusory success we achieved
That he is not pleased with the series.
This means it's impossible for him to agree to the second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can only
Thank you.
To all people
Those who worked on this series.
And congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards from distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
So do you think that.
You are an excellent person.
Certainly, we'll get the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said that readers and the press lie to me.
Yes, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are a wash for art.
Art washing!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Illegal money
The chain is one.
What can we do with "one two"?
What do you mean?
We didn't sign a contract with them, they should be committed.
Write it.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and diverse.
How much did we agree upon in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do to the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Did you tell anyone about your product?
Not really, they told me it was bread, but I don't know what's in it.
Bread with a zipper
You call it a "susta."
Instead of slicing bread, (samon) as you call it = semolina bread.
The inventor tried to make it easier.
Jean's bread
This is the secret.
You eat bread with a zipper.
These people make very strange things.
This zipper is amazing, it's made in a way that makes it dissolve as soon as you put it in your mouth.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Enter, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Tell him, Samih.
We were with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To create a team of drivers and security personnel for him.
It's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, and if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When I took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
People who are important in the company.
Indispensable ones
The hospital's pastry shop.
Why did you bother the man?
I said he couldn't, he's from a well-known family, he can't play football and make a fool of himself.
He can do as he pleases.
But don't take the essentials.
What do I do, Mother? Our team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, whatever happened, happened.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said: "Put on your clothes."
They would make me stand in the goal area.
The match started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to play.
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, Nasser.
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, it's
I don't want to hear anything.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, I'll do it, just because you asked me to.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow we will play the last match of the tournament.
Don't disturb him, ya Bu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Oh, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations
Good, good, good, congratulations.
Hello, Mr. Nasser. I want to speak with you for a minute, please.
Thank you, the team arrived on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we must...
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Call the press and journalists to come here.
No, Rashid, we'll get it at our house.
Lest my father cancel that when he sees the players and their success.
They played and won the cup, they played and won the cup, they played and won the cup, they played and won the cup, they played and won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and talking to the press with them.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Picture.
Leave it close to me.
Take a good screenshot.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's, the bakers', victory made them
Very optimistic
And the effort
And loyalty to the bakery
Excuse me, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
Burke in you
Hello, goalkeeper.
Al-Dawri and al-Qassiss = journalists who will come to interview you.
Yes, they are not from the council.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
God willing, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers. You are blessed by this football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He reduced the price of the engines, and he said "yes" very well.
Yes, I've become famous now. In every picture of me in the newspapers, they write "The first athlete from International Bakeries."
Wasn't I interested in football?
What are you saying?
Because I was at school.
The person who was sitting next to me loves football.
You say I wasn't close to football.
Because the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Being close to sports means I'm a sportsmanship.
That's why we are no longer the international bakria, we have become international football.
I heard him say yesterday that he would make it a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete of the Global Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To improve football
Before the match, tell us your predictions before you go to the theater.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield will be the one that wins today.
Yes, God willing, we are in contact with professional players' agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
Named Saud, listen, we want a commitment.
(Yes, he wants the previous deal for the players)
It was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
Is the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
You just have to notify me once if a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a forward.
Look, these four players
The cost of three of them
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one bundle.
Six hundred thousand, I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Okay, that's about African players, now, for the Brazilian player.
He is the player of the season, costing two million and one thousand dollars alone.
They quoted this price, but I received a fax, let me show you, it's right here. Wait, look, I received it from a club in the United Arab Emirates.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, check his calf.
How is that?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to be deceived, hopefully there's no tear in the cruciate ligament.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this tendon?
Clean! Make a key (rice and meat, traditional food)
Honestly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, the store.
God bless you, you have another business.
No, no, no, only players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the forests of Africa.
Yes, why is that?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human like others.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear him?"
He said they are young.
"As long as we"
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, it will benefit you later.
They go and release him in the playground.
Come come come come
Be lenient with them, he is still young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
You don't need to hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer must understand.
We played 2-0, and we dominated the match.
Father, he is the coach of Spain.
What don't you want from me?
Successful coach
The game must be controlled.
And this, the opposite, is the way to Al Wakrah.
We shouldn't let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We must put an end to these matters.
If he were an expert in soccer, he would have activated the wing players, not attacking from the center.
Yes, I rely on the offside trap.
Mom, don't give me a headache.
He must fire Kakuno Malawi.
And replace it with Shinamo's bubble tea.
No no no no no no no no no no no
They forgot their child in the car.
The line?
Implementing the plan
And I forget Hololo
It is unexpected for this to happen between the coach and the team manager.
The star of the match, the team's star.
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan
Go home.
Don't take him in a bakery car, let him go by taxi.
It's none of your business.
Stay informed.
Do you see what my father, Adel, did?
The coach was fired and sent back home.
What is he doing?
The team is destroyed.
Leave our team.
My mother is a mother.
No, he's crazy. That means he told you he's divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the very first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this man.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talk about the past.
You must go to his father and find out why he divorced your daughter.
I don't know what to say, oh my god! My brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her then?
It's not fair, Abu Abdullah. We need to know, we have the right to know, why did you divorce her?
Please, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
Why shouldn't I interfere? And what is the man waiting for in the living room to find out the reason for his daughter's divorce?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not a lady.
This is Guardiola's team.
That means I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the living room.
If you don't come, I will. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
She has to leave, don't shake your head.
It was not enough for her to curse Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your adopted daughter mocks him. Listen.
Your daughter doesn't love Barcelona and she's not suitable for us (Idom).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Why are you telling me you want my son?
To express regret and to appease her.
God's curse.
Praise be to God, we have more than enough money.
What is the purpose of our money, if we cannot make our son happy?
He, stop.
Importantly, I will look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not angry.
She's crazy, son. Forget about her.
Drink your tea, son!
You know, son, they are the losers.
A thousand girls want to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Alas, she got divorced two days ago.
After a month of marriage.
What's wrong with you, you want me to share with him.
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these unreasonable stories!
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know who he is?
What more do you want!
Her destiny only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and convert into an apartment hotel?
One in Mansoura.
It is run by his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't.
Talk to her brother.
Listen well.
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Only one chance comes once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain, so they can spend every summer there.
Exactly, what about Barcelona?
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove that their daughter is innocent.
We say that the story is true, the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
And not making fun of the team.
Assuming this story is true.
"O Allah, bless you, they called his father Abu Borgain because he has two towers on the corniche."
Design it in a strange way, like winding ropes.
When people see them from a distance, they think it's one tower.
What do you think? All the luck is with you.
Welcome to %pw
"May God bless you. Well, take something, eat something."
Thank you, my love.
But my dear told me that your daughter Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, O my dear Um Abdullah.
If I searched the entire Gulf Cooperation Council, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
You're done, Your Honor. Is there anything else?
Yes, the family will contact you.
Let's see their needs for the wedding, we prepare the check and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God willed it, in the name of God, God willed it, with your permission, Your Honor.
Abdullah divorced again as well!
I want children from you and wealth from him (colloquial)
"May God bless you, auntie."
Protect yourself from the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, mother?
A mother says she has booked us to Malaysia.
What's up in Malaysia, huh?
Bon voyage
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone crying after coming back from their honeymoon?
What's the matter, my daughter? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Mother, she is very arrogant.
Why?
She's arrogant, don't pay attention to her.
I was right to fire her.
I feel sorry for her.
A mother is.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Yes, Spain. Where are we going?
Good.
A mother says she booked us to the Maldives.
Oh, the Maldives are nice too.
She also amuses you.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why did he take the boys?
Come and get the bags.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, light of my eye?
Enough! May God grant you health, you will tell me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you sad?
When I see the scales, I'll be depressed.
The one who bothers you (Idom) might die! Oh, my son!
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has plenty of money and many girls.
Shut up, and I know my son, any little thing bothers him, why should he live sad!
My son, call her and break up with her.
"Curse her, O Lord."
Say it to her three times.
You're divorced. Wait, wait, don't call, two more times left.
Divorced, divorced.
Very nervous.
My son, my dear, relax and don't worry, as they say, there are plenty of fish in the sea, my son.
Oh, problem.
Because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
Who am I calling? He already told me he divorced me, he said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you, he doesn't care.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will you do!
One if needed %pw.
What's the matter! What's turned the world upside down!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and despise him, and he won't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced from Abdullah!
My son is married to a divorced woman!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
Just as you feel a bad taste in your mouth now for your daughter and you are frustrated.
And they did nothing.
%pw she does not come like a queen, she comes like a queen, divided by her.
It is lawful for you to divorce them in a fair manner.
She is still married to a man.
Is this good for you? Let him go to hell!
And feel for others as you would want them to feel for you.
What you do not accept for yourselves.
Don't accept it for the sake of people.
Do you know who owned the land this shopping center is on?
And in a strategic location?
Leave it to God.
And also at a low price.
Closed.
I have to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office the week before and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm out of the office and the problem that I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, I need to get it.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, God willing, to keep you safe is the office, not the house.
Do you eat like that too?
What will make Abu Sakr full?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd.
Do you know him?
What I know, I only see on TV, and you told me that you meet him during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Cut the bullshit.
Oh God, guide you, I came immediately, at least ask about the reason for this holiday.
No need for that, God willing, He will guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he throws fifty feasts.
I suggest that Your Honor be put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the world's most renowned banquet maker.
By the way, who is this brother you're with?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It is an honor for Your Highness.
So now, O Abu Falah!
You say Abu Saqr throws a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But good heavens! Abd al-Falih, the feast tonight is for a special occasion.
Oh God, protect you today, my dear son, Sager.
God willing, you deserve happiness, with blessings.
He's here, hello my son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Saqr should go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I waited for approval for a year and a half.
I was out of work.
But when I reached him
And I will give him money.
O Allah, guide Abu Saad.
Things won't work this way.
I told him "okay."
He has to go to the showroom and choose the car he prefers.
We will buy three for him.
Take it from him!
They took me to him.
You told me that you met him during the Umrah last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
Dinner party game.
This is your chance.
Pass by and congratulate him.
Oh! Your Highness. He deserves to be well.
Shahin Oh! Abu Sakkar.
May God bless you, thank you, people.
May God keep Shahin safe, Your Highness.
"O Allah, bless you."
By the way, who are you?
Mr. Judge
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you (Idom).
Sir, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
And I remember you bought a red cross.
Bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
Honored to meet you.
Just, Falcon, I'm still undecided about entering the field of trade or you've made up your mind.
I'm tired of him.
Why, son of Falcon, trade is good.
You have to start, open an office and then we'll see.
Abu Sakr
Your Honor, please say yes.
Why?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
Even if you love trade and it comes to you, you will say no.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Now that you've got the license, everything comes easy to you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Abu Abdul Aziz was telling your father yesterday that if Sakar wants to join the business, I will allow him to be a 50% partner.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mother, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
It's an opportunity, son! Who can start a business at this time without capital?
Your only true owner is the people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe, [son]! This is your chance in life.
Day, bring lunch quickly.
He also reached the pickles and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for business.
Those were the things I was looking forward to seeing, do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
And Allah protects him from the evil eye of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son has started working."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
**T
I believe, Allah knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Yes, the one in the northern area of our office, what's wrong with it?
No, but I love her.
Thank you and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
May God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What do you say, man! A whole year of misery and toil to set up the supermarket.
What's the matter! I think he passes by the store every day.
He saw him and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me this is Saggar, son of Abu Saggar, who wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Did he also want to be your partner?
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
You started talking to him, didn't you?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said: Action!
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What is the name written on the sign?
It was written: "The Neighborhood Bakery."
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
So how are things going at work for you?
Good sir, we hope to finish the drawings for the Future Company's worker housing tomorrow or the day after.
No, no, Mr. Saqr, this is my wife Elisa. Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Saqr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let them take a car from one of the companies.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now is based on science and study.
Today, someone says, "I want to get into business. I have some money and I want to invest it."
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study of economics or even commerce.
Someone like you.
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Did you hear, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what those two parrots were saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
Look at him.
Look at him today.
Sir, we are not talking about your son Sakr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son, Saqr, God willing, as God has decreed, and I don't want to envy him (may it last), is an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, my son, a falcon builds itself.
He once gave her a car.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And whatever Allah wills, behold it now.
Oh! Of course, we're talking about ordinary people.
He killed one of them, the one Abu Nizar had dealt with, took him and placed him on the road.
Sakar has business talents.
Strong economic privileges.
Who is his father?
I swear I'm amazed.
Whatever God wills.
The Gulf newspaper in the economic referendum
Enter.
Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome Salim.
What's wrong with him?
I swear, I don't know what to say, Salem!
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they told him about it.
Alas, he couldn't bear it.
As you can see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office and the fax was in his hand.
He did him a great deal of good.
As the saying goes, "I taught him archery, and when he became strong, he shot me" (a proverb).
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, O Salim.
I'm shocked.
How true it is that there are such people in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without his left hand knowing what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at Saker Alkhair is to achieve solidarity in this country.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Lastly, but not least, we are now supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of just one hundred and twenty-three riyals.
We won't be late.
Then we'll head straight to you.
Who is this beautiful woman?
This is Khalid and his wife; they want to invite us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, anywhere with you and me together, I'm happy.
My beloved, "May Allah preserve you for me" is an expression.
Oh! My darling.
This is not fair. It's my source of income.
This bakery
And take the money in exchange for interest.
Five rials for full, three rials for hot bread.
2 hummus.
Five beans, perfect, perfect.
They cooked six chickpeas!
God bless you, divers.
The judge is here and has brought breakfast.
I need men.
Please, Your Honor.
What?
No, no, the thing I'm asking you for is that I want to hear the sound of "yes" ringing in my ear.
Hello, Nora.
I'm angry with you.
Can I bear your anger?
So what's the matter?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a simple and clear dress.
Don't say Anoud will get angry.
Oh God, Lebanese people speak very, very well.
And you should not talk to him too much.
Me too, I'm jealous of her.
The best dress for the most beautiful Nouara.
He flirts with her by calling her "Noor".
Feed your brain, how long will it take?
I paid twenty thousand and twenty thousand riyals remain.
You may be a compensation (Idom), congratulations!
O Allah, grant us health and well-being.
Hello, you are the mother of Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
I am at your service (Idom).
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
Take it, you idiot.
Did you like the joke?
Did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to do it, show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, you have better taste.
They will leave us, envy starts to work.
When he realizes that my project is good and starts bringing in income,
They say he will carry out a project like mine.
Design and tailoring shop.
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser who has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He will harm his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes my cousin.
I know you were sleeping, so they woke me up saying your cousin wanted you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like this, like that.
Are you coming to look for a partner or what?
I heard you were designed for that, so I said I must drop by.
Welcome!
If you're looking for a promotion, we've got it here.
Please God, work is going very well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did.
Okay, God willing, goodbye.
So it is.
Are you sure?
And with haute couture, do you know the greatest misfortune!
What is it?
That he rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are jealous! (Ad) You are hateful!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You have to know.
Let your heart be open to your brother.
I'm not coming to ask you.
You deny, you lie, you make me a victim of mockery, and you tell me, me,
I wanted to do my work in secret.
To take that is the neighboring store, you want to put my business out of commission.
But they didn't say come and be like the problem on the other side of the wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is hatred and envy. I swear, I'll slap you. This is hatred. Let me hit him.
Oh, you guys are related!
Well done, Abu Saleh!
Leave me alone, I swear I'll slap you, you with the annoying voice.
I'll hit you the same way you hit me by stealing my boyfriend.
O mankind, count (your blessings).
Say "peace be upon him" ya ahl.
I swear, I swear, you didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, specifically the Lebanese?
They talk to him, laugh, and feel very comfortable.
So Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese man.
He started telling me kind words and convincing me.
I liked it, I liked it with its words.
He convinced me and led me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for 900 riyals.
Earning money.
A Lebanese designer was brought in.
Can I meet with the gentleman? Yesterday you told me he was difficult, is he still difficult today?
Yes, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong with him?
No, I don't know? What's wrong?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened the shop and brought in a Lebanese designer who looks like him.
Two weeks ago, the store's sales decreased.
This is the problem here in Qatar, no Qatari will open a store unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project, opening the same store right next to him. Can I go in?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now thinking about a solution.
What do we do now?
We are sitting as if we had eaten poison.
If we keep like this, frankly, it won't even cover the rent of the shop.
A place far from them.
That means we'll clear the field for them.
Good, thank you. And what is the discount?
No, why don't you give an evening gown free with every wedding dress?
Let's go.
What's wrong? What happened? We're going to the store next to you, today they put up an ad that with every wedding dress, you get two evening dresses for free and a twenty-five percent discount.
Alright, let's go.
Now wait for two weeks, they will announce the same ad, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing. If we leave them, they'll destroy us.
Don't worry about yourself.
What else did he do?
It's definitely a challenge.
Certainly this is a challenge.
Bravo, this scoundrel deserves it, no one wants to live off his earnings.
If that happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days, I'll close his shop.
Bravo.
Wait, wait, close, close, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's up?
Saud says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit in it, and he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, it's impossible.
His smell won't leave the shop for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cut the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now, will you sign an undertaking or shall we start a lawsuit and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will end it from this life.
Oh! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, close, close, there's a customer coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He lies in his bed groaning.
He told me it was a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank had called and they needed the installments.
The debts piled up on him because of his evil cousin.
What happened to him this time?
How terrible of them, when they accidentally entered and saw Saad the designer, they screamed in his face and ran away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, she didn't feel sleep, her eyes were open and she was looking at the ceiling.
What I know is what he did to me.
Saud is in the shop.
He put him under his spell, I don't know what he did to him.
When women see the man, they are afraid of him.
What I know is what's around it!
He lost me, he lost me.
I have a lot of debts.
For fear of being imprisoned.
I have no evidence against him to sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forgot it, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you did to him. You turned his clothes designer into a monster, and women are afraid when they see him.
Spread a rumor.
This is unacceptable, gentlemen! Tell him the shooting team needs you urgently.
God bless you, people, God protect you, tell him you need him desperately, desperately.
I swear they will raise my pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
Of course, dear Ahmed, don't get angry. You have heart problems, this is not good for you, man!
%PW I testify that I called him several times, my ear hurts, but he is useless. These add-ons will drive me crazy, drive me crazy.
You do nothing, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll tell you a lot.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed wants to finish it.
So I'll call off the shooting because the extra actor didn't show up.
What about production?
I have nothing to do with this, Sir Abdullah. Why is he shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout in your face,
What happened to Abdullah?
Extra late and they're in trouble.
Ahmed! I don't need anyone, dear.
Look for someone with gravitas and a good reputation who can convince people that he can really be a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, place your order and it will be ready within half an hour.
No one, Ala'a, no one, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll handle two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What will they do now?
They do everything, see how the director gets nervous and his speech becomes disorganized, but they can handle him.
Does someone need special features, where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know a person, God willing he will help you with him, I hope he will be suitable.
%PW Saud Al-Olaiki !
Saud was a giant! I remember him as Saud the Oak.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud Al-Olaik, and when they grew up, they called him Kansa.
Why the cans?
I'll tell you why. Poor, he would walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
Hello! My rich and respected brother, no, brother, don't feel discouraged.
His appearance is suitable, as I recall he is stocky and fat, not tall and not thin.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Good luck, but you need to put on good makeup for him, and I guarantee it will be suitable and also fun.
Good, wait what, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud Kanz's house?
What is he saying?
Close your mouth, close your mouth.
Saud was a janitor.
We don't have anyone in the neighborhood named Saud Kanz.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's correct.
But this is not Saud Kanz.
This is Saud's laptop.
Of course it is, but it evolves over time because the laptop is like a can.
He is tall, fat, and a little bit brown.
He ditched the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, man!
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the other Gotra, where is it?
Holiday.
These are the ones I'm looking for.
Vicks VapoRub Brand X.
Go and squeeze it a bit before going out, it's wrinkled.
But I've been feeling bad lately.
Mother, may God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting that you go to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they told me they would give me the money.
Please, God, you are working now instead of being unemployed.
Mother, well, goodbye.
You'll fight her, you'll get angry and go upstairs.
You sit and move very slowly, and the camera with you, will move beside you.
Yes. Ja'far! Yes.
Is your laptop soft?
Abu Abdullah, this is the well-known actor Abdullah Al-Lama.
Who is this question for? You, me, my son, Abu Oud, how are you?
How are you, my servant?
Act properly, you should behave a little properly in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Wash your face, wash your face, wash your face, wash your face, be quiet, be quiet.
I love acting, I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
It's not what you think, brother.
Very sick, you know I didn't sleep last night, brother!
Asthma, my brother, may God have mercy on you.
"O Allah, grant her well-being."
Your life is like cups of cherry (proverb).
Oh! My lord! My lord!
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look for yourself, listen to what he's saying, he has no point.
What is her mother's name?
You're nuts, what do you think?
I heard what she said about you.
She says you're too optimistic, you should be more restrained.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix my defective car tires.
And give him three million to bring me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm rigid based on some people's requests.
Look, Mr. Ghaleb overlooked the production of our neighborhood, actors of a high level.
Now he is excellent, and he is suitable for the role.
Perfect, I'll help you, I have no feelings, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is like cups of cherry (proverb).
He took him to the makeup room, did his makeup, and I'll tell Salman to bring the costume to you.
Going, going, going, this is nice.
Good, good.
Listen, brother, keep the car with us when we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
Don't burden me, but is there anyone who can take me?
For carrying you! Well, I'll let our driver carry you. Well, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the extra one, call him.
Oh! People call Saud the laptop from the makeup room.
Then let him brush my teeth.
He has already written in front of me.
Certainly, do we want to review?
This means I!
I didn't expect that from you.
We will fight, for what!
We will fight for our rights.
Yes, wait.
And you must know who you are talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Release and stop.
We do not marry the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He will clean it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you are going to enter the fitting room to change your clothes and we are ready for the shoot.
My teeth, the toothpaste is expensive.
Oh! The filming of this scene has been postponed.
Why this?
I don't like tea, brother. I'm bored and my stomach is full of tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, what time will it be?
"I didn't see anything, it's very common."
May God give you health.
They are fast.
Thank you, Sir. May God protect you.
Send my regards to your people.
Abu Abdulaziz tells you hello.
Your Highness, well done.
It was fun, wasn't it?
He who resembles you, greets you and kisses your nose as well.
The first time someone kisses me on my nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream stick, it cuts your lips. That was funny, that was fun.
You didn't laugh!
Don't mention it.
Can I be an actor?
What's wrong? What's wrong with your voice?
Son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Run quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
Look at her or there yourself, man.
Listen to me!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, son!
"Peace be upon you, no harm to you, my lord."
Let, let, let, let
And don't worry, God willing, you will be, Dr. Hassan come here, come here.
Yes, Dr. Hani. What happened?
Let him rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be fine.
Hello, hello sir, hello.
Shut your mouth or I'll punch you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, sir.
How are you, sir?
"God on you (may it last)."
Yes, Sir.
Hello, sir, please sit down.
Bless you.
With your ugly face (Idiom).
Go with him, Master Rashood.
I swear, if I don't do something for you, tell me and you'll see what I'll do for him.
Oh! My friend, can I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me!
Can I ask you, friend?
Son, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, you haven't found any of them, they are good and accept anything.
Unlike the native ladies.
Don't forget the citizens.
Certainly, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
But, my brother! She's ignoring me.
Certainly, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intentions are good.
Nothing is wrong.
Act properly.
Or get out, get out, and if you don't leave, I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
To me.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Falih Al-Marzook.
Marrying him means marrying him.
No, no, I need the abaya, the clothes, and also the car, I will rent them from you.
Because I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
God bless us.
This is %PW in the ass !
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
The apple of my eye signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I want you to have come.
They were surprised by what I did with them; it was a very elegant and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
You have no excuse now.
What is this?
Mom, I promised my friends I'd be at work tomorrow.
Will you take this to them!
Yes, what's wrong with it?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take this to his friends to cause a scandal.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow you're buying me something classic.
Yes, but I've already promised them.
I have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, it's still open. Go and change your clothes so we can bring something that pleases people.
What's wrong with you! Come on.
They are reasonably priced and of very high quality.
Above average, not the best!
Of course there's the top-tier chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for something more reasonably priced.
This is very expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive?
This is unimaginable, look at this piece of art.
This is what is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested in the Spanish court.
Give me this one.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, with joy!
Here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in the accounts.
By God's grace, it's worth it, give me another one.
And quickly bring the coffee.
Aunt, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, my dear, I attended their wedding. It was embarrassing, disgusting. Can you believe it, sister!
Did you listen to your aunts?
That's why I want to throw you an unparalleled wedding party.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll arrange everything.
But he doesn't allow me to do anything.
You don't live in the community, you don't see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw for yourself,
When you buy something beautiful, you see how they praise you and admire your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's wonderful and amazing?
Certainly, but how much did we pay?
The pound we spent on chocolate, we could have bought four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
That means they will accept whatever we choose.
Ew, you have a really bad taste.
What's your opinion at this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the past was beautiful!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought about creating a platform like a computer mouse.
Excuse me for a moment.
Look, he talks about everything except the stage and arrangements. This is where the women who have nothing will stay, but just gossip, just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We will go to the mouse stage.
This is a very strange phase.
The latest model in 2011.
We have already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, all of this is for your own good.
So you must choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you'll have to pay an additional twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Decide and we are ready.
I'm not the first one to get married.
What do you think of yourself, will you get married in the Comoros? That's how things are in our country.
And we, too, are still at the beginning.
If you don't have a use for a stage, what are you going to do with the girl? Put her in a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in fact, they are con artists.
So what's the matter now?
Are you angry and frustrated?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I will call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is going through very difficult circumstances.
Does he not want to get married? Can't he afford it? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you place it on the tables at the wedding reception,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and eighty-seven, okay.
But Samer, I don't want to see this band at any wedding.
You know people's talk.
Good, it's booked.
Your salary is higher than mine.
We're going to have a problem we can't handle.
"O Allah, grant us, O Saleh."
But perhaps God will guide you, you must try to settle things.
Please, I have decided, praise be to God, to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say there's a wedding that costs you only two thousand dollars and you enjoy it.
Bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You just need to specify the number of cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about him, you don't care what people will say.
People know the wedding standards from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they read these invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
Look at their wedding, if those were their invitations, they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we'll order it online.
It has a cloth cover, panda skin, and a silver sparkle.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be a hot topic for the ladies, we'll ask for invitations, we'll ask for invitations!
I'm sorry for him, man.
Certainly, his family put a lot of pressure on him.
Oh! The man is collecting money from everyone.
What he said, he even sold his car.
He looks twenty years older. This morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, brother. He's poor. I don't know when we'll grow up.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, brother.
Why didn't you try to convince them to have a wedding based on your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why, I live alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the appearance of sickness, boasting, and display.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Once, I gestured to the bride's mother.
I was a victim of her verbal assault (proverbs).
Trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married,
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And say your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding party.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so angry?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every Sunday one of his friends gives him a ride.
I entered the room before and found him talking to himself.
I see, you've changed your mind now.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, his mother stopped him.
I have no problem with you or him.
I am no less than people.
Don't make us laugh.
Please, mother, this is enough. My brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
Please, shut your mouths.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother told me I have no money, so she shouted at him, and he told me he will cancel the wedding, he doesn't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She is unconscious and they are administering first aid to her.
He said her condition was much better now and they would find her a room in the hospital.
What a scandal!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you a sleeping injection.
How can I relax when he wants us to laugh at good and evil.
I told him to bring Abdullah Roaished, and he said to me, "I don't have any money."
I feel sorry for your mother.
I'm afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And I told her that I would do what she wanted.
I'll bring Abdullrahman Roeshd for you.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not fair, you couldn't find anyone but Abu Yusuf.
What's wrong with it!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man and, moreover, he was disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If he said to you the same words he said to me, there's a good chance his heart would stop.
Yes, I did.
Because you're going through a financial crisis and want to ask Abu Youssef for some money from the ministry's funds, of course.
And Allah alone knows when you will return it to Him.
And when the people came to him for their accounts and asked him about their money,
He might indeed be in trouble.
No one will know and will know how to deal with it.
To you, the man in his office, and you are responsible if anything happens to him.
I am kidnapping in my last days!
Well, they don't call it stealing,
On the first floor.
Over there, there's a white box wrapped in blue ribbon with a circle and a picture of a dove's wing, bring it, bring it.
Abu Yusuf, me, if I don't encounter difficulties,
I'll give them all back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
I have entered my last days.
Corrupt me, O Thursday.
Healthy, healthy.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying, if it was someone else they would've been slapped or something bad would've happened to them! Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Healthy, healthy.
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I can't get out of the marriage.
And you don't know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the panic button, the panic button.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
My brother Abu Yusuf, the box is full of discs, which one do you need?
The box with a picture of a man in a state of panic.
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Roaished and his band.
You will see, my dear.
No, I won't tell you.
The season will be a string of successes.
We were the first in the world to use it.
Mum mum
Bye bye.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the promises when you enter the dance hall.
The ladies here have evil eyes.
I told you before that it's wonderful.
The best groom ever, may God protect you, I don't want to burden you.
Mum mum, the police are knocking at the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people who are taking the test came.
And now solve it, I'll be imprisoned, oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a contract worth three million, two million of which was just for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but the corruption does not go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
He told me, "What did the minister say to Uthman?"
And why didn't our president object? They say he was in on it!
As far as I know, I swear to what I know.
Where is morality?
Right has become wrong and wrong has become right!
Hello! Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Oh, gentlemen, what has happened to the world?
I just fired him!
Except?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is in a relationship with the minister.
What a strange world (Idoma).
What's the matter, guys, don't you know who she is?
This new employee whom the minister hired instead of the lucky Osman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Object to the minister!
You're crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here he is, standing by the elevator.
This is the reward of sincerity and truth, my brother Saleh.
I hope we can do anything for you, brother.
Thank you, thank you for everything.
What's wrong, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see unbelievable things.
I'm at your service.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work to pick up some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, okay bye.
Who's driving my sister home?
She is sitting in the front, laughing and talking, who is she?
This is my university colleague, what's the harm if he drives me home? He's fine.
God, I can't believe it, why do you look like ancient history!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You're old-fashioned.
Right and wrong are old and new!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The era of international changes that harmonize with the world and that no one can keep up with.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Monira, it's against my nature to be nervous and angry.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her he's sorry.
Life doesn't work the right way.
Don't worry, come for lunch.
Let me sleep to rest.
The president is not upset with you.
Is the president not upset?
No, not angry, go wash your face and have lunch.
Of course, dear.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
It is an honor for Your Highness.
Certainly, certainly.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
But at the same time, it is extremely important.
To recall some of the values and principles by which you work.
For public interest.
This is what your honor should be.
We all have to be.
Lotting is very important, Your Highness.
Let's be thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
What I also want to say
And warning you about my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
I am honest, loyal, and sincere, and such bad things.
Just one doubt.
There is an honest employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, it will be as Your Honor wishes.
Please, God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, sir, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Sir.
Khaled, you have received a lot of praise, God bless you.
Certainly, Your Honor.
Hello! Your Highness, you know how to choose.
May God guide you.
Why did you let the devil manipulate you?
O Allah, grant us sincerity in word and deed.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Get out, my daughter.
No, no, I won't do that again.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Enough.
That means he has become honest.
It is a shame to say that your father is honest.
Is this the costume!
Your whole body is covered.
What will people see?
Inshallah, if you're looking for a job, no one will hire you in this condition.
Is there a respectable lady who covers her body and features?
She covers her chest, she wears it even here, she's choking herself.
I hated her, my son.
And I had bought her a shirt and pants that revealed her midriff above her navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I tell you!
You'll have only yourself to blame.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us is currently looking for the right man for his daughter.
Let me tell you, my son Rashid.
He is a very good man.
He didn't stop drinking (Idom).
He's been drunk for 24 hours.
Drunk, tipsy, and hungover all day.
And do not ask about the rebellion.
He has a good upbringing.
And let me tell you also that he is a fraud.
And how about the theft?
That's what's expected of you. How are things with drugs?
Not clear, it's done. I'll give you five riyals if you want to get his eyes' pupils, I'll make a competition out of him.
By the way, Abu Sara, we just came to ask about her hand.
You know loitering and hanging out.
We know she came from a good family.
A son is a blessing, a blessing, that's how life goes, with blessings.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Good, come.
Okay, goodbye, goodbye.
Okay, call your father to come and pick you up.
Why should I call him?
So that he can come to pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's there, showing off with his keffiyeh with a blonde girl.
In fact, your father walks straight and enjoys it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name is Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's correct.
You've ruined your daughter.
And it has been known since the establishment of the State of Palestine, with its capital in Jenin, in the year two thousand and ninety, after signing a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest claims raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second article, paragraph one thousand, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails daily.
Now let's move on to the crucial meeting.
Mr. Sheep
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Oh! Man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation and leaving me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Sir Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find any solid thing, stone or plastic, as a commitment.
Oh! Even our homes.
What do you, the Gulf residents, call it?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very important point, and I would like to vote on this matter because nail growth is a breach of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
To control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you will start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and throw his clothes at him, and he does nothing.
How many times did he come to me without his ghutra.
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to expel him.
The children throw chalk at him.
They are dragging Goutra in the break in front of everyone.
And they said that this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Go, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? That's new, no one told me!
Pour a whole bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the boys laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop.
By the way, the manager you'll be starting work with tomorrow contacted me.
But, okay, we'll let him have a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
As if the age of kindness and weakness has ended.
Oh! Dean Oh! Abdullah
You'll see Rashid differently.
And there is no need to remind you of the important educational phrase,
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know the saying,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
Even if someone is going to make a mistake.
He will face a problem.
When you start talking, he just said shut up.
You'll see what I'm going to tell him.
Which one of you mocked me and said, "Be quiet"? Which one?
You're the one who told me to shut up!
No, not me.
So it's you, the one next to you, you!
Stand up, and go to the manager.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, do you hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
You don't just need to be okay on your first day, you need to be okay all year round.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I am explaining or speaking.
You know what that means.
Do you know what it means to be tense?
Means tense.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the class.
Go to the manager.
Take your luggage and leave now!
Take your luggage.
It doesn't bother me.
Certainly, he's still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see him.
By the way, ice cream with milk is very delicious if it has strawberries inside.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and so does man.
It's just a lie, my son.
But more importantly, your father doesn't know the story!
What I want is the chocolate in my bag.
I'm fine, and where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I'm at your service.
They said you're happy with yourself.
You won't know how to distinguish between the rich boy and the poor boy.
Fate, how does disaster look green or red?
Here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before them all, one juice and one chip.
I took it before anyone else, I bothered them. My friend Abdurrahman, by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get a PlayStation CD from him.
So what do we learn from this story?
That man
He has morals.
This is the PlayStation console. He also told me to bring the PlayStation in one go.
I'm fine, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
There is nothing now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
I thought I should bring the party file before my trip.
How can I accompany you in the afternoon? Abdurrahman told me but didn't tell me where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
Please, God, keep him safe, as long as his father hasn't returned and hasn't said anything to him, please, God, keep him safe.
We said that I hadn't taken it this afternoon, so he got angry and told his father. No, no, no, it's a disaster, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman.
O Allah, grant us health and well-being.
What you do is a matter.
You love her, you love her like this.
Today, guys, we'll have a new science lesson.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, you didn't ask anything, I'm at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there a teacher who brings water to the student, are you his tea diver? This incident will not pass like this, I will write it in the report.
And you too are laughing, laughing at me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
How much is enough?
Good, so how many cars do you have?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he will be standing in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Okay, I broke the table.
Don't worry, brother.
Why?
Are you different? (Idiom)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
Aren't I telling you the threat, brother?
What do you mean by "not needing" and I want to please you?
What are you saying?
Instead of, what do they call it?
It seems you want.
You want this, as you like.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
Not as he likes, that's not fair!
The neighborhood (Idom) does not have
We are coming to Uncle Naif to discuss not shouting.
Who is this Rashid doing what he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Welcome, gentlemen. Be quiet and listen to what Uncle Abu Nayef has to say.
Now, this loser who isn't worth a penny, play with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If you don't hit him in the face, he won't stick to what he did under the umbrella.
The game is played by the players (Idom).
Is this good?
Goodbye.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Do you know he now has a jewelry store!
That's why I see you wearing all these rings and bracelets here.
O God, grant us.
Walk, will you stay in the heat?
I can't believe that Rashid, the simple and poor man, has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
He will tell you, he will teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Don't mention it.
Don't mention it, Abdullah.
I'll tell you what the secret is.
The professor has come, the professor has come.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
Here I tell you, we won't get a chance as good as this.
I, am looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
No, my brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
Your mother sends you greetings. May God protect you, I will tell her, he sends greetings to him.
Good luck, goodbye dear, in God's care (Adom).
What more do you want, brother? Haha!
Oh! Mama, we'll work, we'll work at a high level.
But, my son, if you work with him, don't they say anything?
He's giving it to you like that.
This is okay, right?
Sure! This is automatic, without a doubt.
My love, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, mine.
Building a tower between the Corniche towers.
God bless you, you're not waiting!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is angry.
It doesn't seem so, brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
Do you think he stands, picks up the mobile, and gives it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's something more to this, and I'm a million percent sure that Abu Sultan holds a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh is not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Really, to this extent?
The car door is opened for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh! My son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women will start talking about me. Don't mention Latouf, the dish collector; she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, O father of lines, speak. I am jubilant, I will fall.
Certainly, I know what I'm doing.
It's none of your business.
Monira, I'm working at a slow pace.
By opening the door for him, that's the start of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane.
To allow them to shoot him.
Yes, plan.
He has to trust me in the beginning.
They told me we appoint him as a minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I'm very sure he'll be fired from his job.
The magic may wear off.
What is it?
What is this either?
And at every event he attends, the photographer will take some pictures of him so that his photo becomes very common in the newspaper.
And it smells so bad that it floats on the surface.
Are you sure?
Wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Highness,
Certainly, your happiness.
So tell me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be foolish, people want to give you a prestigious position and you want to humiliate yourself.
Minister only, enter, enter.
No, no, no, don't take pictures of me no. Just the Minister, one picture, one picture, Your Excellency.
Take one more.
Oh! Brother, I really love your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he has that too.
I want to tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look at the size of his picture with the groom.
Say: "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, every day I have one or two pictures.
As you say, he is a social activist, well, well, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is present everywhere (Idom).
They are envious, they envy you. Only the tree that bears fruit is stoned. (proverb)
Take me to the market!
Not ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For a famous person,
You're home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is getting worse.
I'm tired, really tired. It's been a month and I'm still walking with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Mother of Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh! Woman, I just want him to take me.
You've started to love her.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you were convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is worried, it seems he loves this story.
I will send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
God wants the ant to die, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Marriage?
Don't you remember, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see it with the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, isn't there?
Is it okay if I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
O God, have mercy on all.
Does this minister allow us to sleep or rest?
It means he couldn't find a party, wedding, or any problem to blame it on.
He took him to the 16,000 Hotel and found nothing for him. He's as unlucky as his face.
Just stay silent, please.
You didn't find his birthday or anything.
Go, you might meet the other half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He didn't sleep! He wasn't tired, brother.
Oh! Man, the newspaper editor says the first thing is to set up his picture and then make the newspaper.
She said my children had participated in a contest about your minister husband's picture.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You should come to the café and listen to the daily comments about his pictures in the newspaper. It's a never-ending chatter.
Wow, I came very close to death.
As they say, when God wills a butterfly to die, it draws near to the light.
People will leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't mention him. Who is he?
You've ruined my hearing.
"O Allah, bless you and bless her."
She said that we all got married except for poor Amal; she's the only one of us who didn't.
This is my destiny.
It is beyond my power to get married.
And forget about marriage.
God is sufficient for whoever relies on Him.
Do you see those who are sitting there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Who do you see playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father's death, I mean he killed him.
You saw him, he's grown up, hasn't he?
It's not right to let him associate with the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mother. But she doesn't have one maid, she has two for him.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere. My son Khalid is not your son.
You don't have any other problem besides Khalid, the servants, the maids, and Khalid.
Mom, this is not good, Khalid is with the maid for 24 hours and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a minute, if I don't tell my father about you.
Let me tell you something, what's up with Khalid?
Saoud says that Khulood wears makeup and imitates girls. What's the matter? What's the matter?
God, God, God! Oh! Saud.
Khalud is putting makeup on his face! It's just a little makeup. A child saw him playing with the makeup palette.
I saw a very small spot, barely visible.
He is kind, good, and gentle.
I will scold Saud.
I haven't seen you for a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Kholodi, my dear Saad, will be a desk and what do you want to become?
This year, we will go to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the cartoonist in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khaled, and his cats.
And say, "Peace be upon Samoura."
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
And today my father told me about the choice.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the adjacent land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my dear, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
Did you teach me how to fish?
Wow, oh my God! Amal, I want to open my eyes and tell myself that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells very strange.
God, what's wrong with me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
And God willing, do you speak to people like this outside?
I can't believe this, Khalid.
Please, get out of my room!
Alas, Khadija!
I failed to meet my expectations.
My love, don't hurt me, I swear I'll tell my mother.
This is my son, and I know him well.
How lucky you are, Khalid, my light, I wish all children could enjoy the tenderness of your feelings and emotions.
And when you see someone acting tenderly and calmly, you call them gay.
Shame on you, shame on you to say such a word about your brother.
Stop, you've made a big mess out of nothing.
He only wears very nice perfume. What's the difference between men's and women's perfume?
Here I'm telling you, don't say that in front of your father.
She has.
I'll show you, but be quiet, so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How do you meet these girls?
It's a shame for such a beautiful girl to do that!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I feared he felt there was something attached to him.
Take a break.
I know you're watching the viral Bluetooth video.
I'm waiting for Saad, come on.
How are you, Saad?
"May Allah protect you."
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Drank anything?
I see you sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He was afraid of him.
Don't even try, I told you not to try.
Seek refuge from the devil, my son, for my sake!
I have already booked.
I'm going far away. How can I face people? I can't!
And what should I tell your father?
Say anything to him.
Oh, these kids only bring trouble, good Lord.
This is the end, Mama.
I remember when Khalid was little.
Of course, this will be the result.
Stop, please get out.
The right thing always causes pain.
The can was broken.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is off for a while.
And you're blaming me, Amal?
You are a girl and you spend all day at home.
What do I say when I'm a man meeting people all day long outside.
It's difficult, Amal.
I cannot live with spending my day, my life, and always having my head hanging down.
The father believed for some time that there was something wrong in the house and that there had been a change.
How long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don't.
I am guilty, Amal, when I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, which allowed us to live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves the house, the mother takes responsibility for the children.
We don't want to dig up the past now.
Does the father know or not?
But I'm ready to do that.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my father's face.
I'll be destructive.
Don't, Amal, don't!
He knows how to throw us.
Much better than knowing someone else.
How sad that our home has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called Immortality had exploded in it.
Traditions and customs.
You will find them arrogant.
Closing their ears to him
They don't want to listen to her.
They only listen to one voice.
Which is filth and madness.
They trample on all that is good.
What comes to your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, but God help you, my son.
O Allah, grant us health and well-being.
People who return bring gifts, not those who are going on a trip.
You're right.
This is a rule.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did her son see her?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's the matter?
Dad, what's wrong, Dad?
Father!
Don't worry.
You are a great person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't break up with you because of anything wrong with you.
I have divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I agree for my cousin to be the father of my children.
Your brother is as queer as you are.
The walrus
You're here every day.
Before you ever come.
You were hidden underground.
This was before we were on Earth.
These are very powerful words, can you handle such words?
You receive 2,200, you earn a lot of money!
Say what God wills.
Go, go.
I've been here for seven months, stop bothering me and let me go home.
What about the embarrassment and shame! Every time he takes me to someone's house, their driver asks, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is mocking you.
He came less than seven months ago.
You have distanced yourself from me, my son, you have distanced yourself.
They sent him away so that we might be saved.
Send him and bring someone else!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what lies beyond this word! He doesn't know what it costs in time and money.
And driving practice. Send him back and let's get rid of him!
The first time I came to my house six months ago,
Alright, I'll tell you something new.
Oil is now $114, before it was five riyals per liter, maybe even less. Everything is becoming expensive, sir.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
When you came here for the first time, what salary did I give you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've only been here for six months and this eight hundred pound salary is way too much.
I need money.
These drivers you're talking about are old, old, you're new.
These seven hundred have now become eight hundred.
Go!
He told me he would give me only an extra hundred riyals.
And three hundred is of no use.
Is what I told you the right thing?
No, no screen. I'll be in trouble when I escape.
No, I'm afraid of him.
Whoever flees from their sponsor.
Why are you afraid?
Because the shepherds came before those people.
Give them a salary of 600 to 700. Do you know how much they get?
How much do you earn?
So, why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
God is sufficient for him.
Nasser woke up and I told him to go see him.
There was no one.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What I did!
They did everything they could, they took his passport and put it with them.
You may go, sir. You are excused.
We will challenge him everywhere.
The thing causing the problem, the thing causing the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They got us into trouble and caused us pain.
I told you to send him back.
But do you think that I will leave him?
I will find him no matter what.
He's going to come back, meaning like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
I've reached my limit, I hope to find him.
A man has just entered, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what were we afraid of? We were afraid that our team wouldn't score any goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared, you were afraid of the other team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm worried they won't be able to score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The rival team has nothing.
Excellent! The Fox team has now scored a goal, so you are ahead with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Follow me, I'll give you a tour.
Thanks, man.
Why try, you can't beat our team!
Ladies and gentlemen, the match has just started and the tournament has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said it was extremely difficult.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend Sajjad.
Take it, sir.
What did he make for himself?
Yes, he is Indian.
Yes, my God, he's crazy about football.
Don't say such things about our team, Fox.
They will win, they will win.
Come on, Sajid, come on, Sajid, hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up. Take water with you, the Foxes are playing today.
Dear audience, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Fox Club, called Thaaleb.
They say you beat them because they're incomplete.
What they say, what they say isn't true.
What is incomplete? Each team has ten players.
If there's neither one nor two, it won't change anything.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Certainly, on the occasion of Oh! Thaaloub's victory, a final word you want to say to the foxes.
All words fade.
When they say the name of foxes.
Her name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Here we are, O beautiful God.
So where is the Indian player who is a football fan?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Oh! The man is a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio called Starbucks or Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and didn't have money for a cup of tea.
The boy gave me twenty riyals in advance.
What made him like this?
Oh! [Man], he sits with the important executives in the club, they help him and do whatever he wants.
Can I say something fox-like?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This is the Fox team, they are my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
You haven't heard his poem about governance that he wrote for your happiness.
When we played a match against them.
Please, please oh! Fox, say, say this verse, say, say.
Oh my God, who knows my secret.
My spirit is in great pain.
I don't sleep at all at night.
You know we're the Foxes' fan club.
Can you tell me the winner's name so I can have the inside scoop?
We will hold a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name.
The one who spends.
The famous Foxy, this fan who was honored today by the Fox Club management in a rare and stunning generous gesture.
Yes!
Our greetings to Tha'lab for this beautiful honor, and this is indeed a wonderful gift.
What do you think, is it a pen or a watch?
That's it, Dad, I swear.
This is a sign.
I'm telling you, it's him.
We need to inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All the fans, all, all, all the fans.
No, no, no! My son, this is not him, this is his lookalike.
I'm telling you it's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the game times, brother.
Now how can we catch him?
We have to wait until the Fox team plays their next game.
Here he is, here he is, I've seen him.
Alright, let's catch up with him.
Ah! I was late.
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Follow him, follow him, follow him, follow him.
The character whose identity we don't know for sure.
I'm telling you, Father, it's him.
I say the right and wise thing to do is to go to them and ask them by telling the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Dad, you always make things complicated.
We're reporting him, and I'm sure of it.
Earth, protected by God. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
and the other land beside it.
Tell my father that Abu Abdurrahman al-Sabi says hello, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we are wrong, my son. We came for a companion whom we thought he was.
The Exalted and Glorified Lord creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, your happiness, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry and thank you, thank you.
Excuse me, I'm here to help you. Goodbye, God bless you, goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
What I know is what your father will do! I'm very worried.
What have you done, Waleed?
When, when, when I was walking, the bag handle caught on it.
And try to sort things out now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to tell this to your father!
Before my father knows?
It was broken into a million pieces.
Mom, let's buy something similar to it as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mom.
You know my father; when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
Mistakenly, he hit the bottle with his bag, fell, and shattered.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter!
They're afraid for him and scaring him, do they want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Me too, if he comes, he'll have me call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Aunt, I know where Wael is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
God bless us. Oh God.
Here he is.
Please, grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me in your home.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear I don't know.
Your father also scares you, so may God guide him.
Follow me, my son.
Don't worry, my son, as long as I am in the house, don't worry, my son.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed.
Please, Abu Walid, I beg you.
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
Why wasn't I at home?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Of course, my son Waleed, your father will get you anything.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, my son, yes.
Are you just going to leave it there? I'm afraid one of the kids will hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me that I need to bring him one like the one I brought you that Walid broke.
He wants the exact same thing. I go and find this only, the last one in the shop. He's very lucky. Where are the children?
In the room, he studies.
Certainly, let's take care of it.
Just one more game and I'll stop.
Oh, wow
Yes, then study!
Our father, this game only and we will study.
Please, Father, don't tell Uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother, Abi. This is the last time, I swear.
I'll call him.
And you, in particular. You took advantage of me, your friend at the café?
You'll see if I haven't told my brother about you!
Alright, I won't call. Here's the phone in my pocket if you're going to study that's good.
My daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
O Allah, guide my mother.
Because he beats him all the time, he scares him to death.
What a bad boy!
Wait.
Mom, where is his money? I don't see it with you today.
And I went with her.
My sister doesn't accept abayas.
Oh, oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Monira and her son Nayef.
Her son is the age of a newborn, blessed be he.
And of the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband, Youssef, doesn't.
I learned about the story yesterday.
He told her, shouting at her.
He asked me, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He must take his son and tie him to the middle of the backyard.
And afterward he says to him, "Do that again, and urinate in your bed."
He talks a lot about nothing.
What did you say, Umm Manira?
I was telling her to eat, eat.
Eat and come, it is delicious.
Disgusts me.
Mother, Mother.
It's good that your father didn't know about you.
Or else he will beat you to death.
Of course, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up, or he'll make a disaster out of you.
I won't listen to what you say.
How evil they are!
They cry and tremble.
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle so he can punish them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they passed the exam.
Why would you take them to their uncle?
Nasir got 48 out of 50.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
And believe me, I agree with his point of view.
Forgetting feelings
And my brother must punish them.
I'm ready, I'm ready.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Shut your mouth, shut your mouth, shut your mouth. I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
I didn't see you, you don't listen to who's doing it to me.
Shame is not becoming of you, boy!
Hit him more, let me punish him.
Oh! Stop it, Uncle.
So next time you study well, come back!
Of course, enough.
Do I know what I'll do?
I'll let you jump one after another and you'll be falafel.
Be careful about going with your family to public places.
It created a misunderstanding for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Son, everyone has left, even the buses. Wait for someone to pick you up.
At the school entrance, which means he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatens him if he doesn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, Walid. Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome, we live together in our new episode of our program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is the world's primary source of energy.
The Arabian Gulf and Iran alone possess 687 billion barrels.
Then Iran with 12%, followed by Iraq with 10%, and then Kuwait and the UAE with 9% each.
Each of them comes after that with seven percent in Venezuela.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf and Iran represent two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
And in this segment, we try to understand many of the complexities related to oil.
And the problems faced by oil-exporting countries.
Despite their prices being significantly high
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
which will then appear on the screen, or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
and other producing countries
Today, what determines the price is market power.
No, it's not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a role.
But other factors are
The last factor is political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
Stock markets and everything else
And turned to prices in speculation.
I am a "commodity" like oil, for example.
And tomorrow it will rise to a thousand dollars, God knows.
In 2004, oil jumped from $40 to $44.
And today we see that even gas prices
Varies from day to day.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And rose in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most global filters are under maintenance.
"That always, for the second quarter"
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, temperatures drop below ninety degrees.
And all this indicates that speculation has authority and control over the market now.
A lot has changed since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection to the so-called anticipated American war.
Political or Geopolitical Implications
It can affect the oil market either negatively or positively in a rapid way.
The effects will certainly come and will have their impacts.
Even speculators also react to political influences.
May confirm, will say, some will tell you that the U.S. war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in light of what the White House has said.
This led to a return of tension in the area.
This is the mystery.
But Fallon had seen this scenario.
He has a quick mind in the oil market.
Today, we proved with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have risen to more than half of the past five years.
Meaning today, no, I mean to say...
Not even for the next war, because today I tell you that even the world has a profitable warehouse.
Even in today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues at gas stations.
This is something else.
What risks does this issue cause?
What number do you expect? I don't know.
$200 or maybe $300, perhaps less
It might happen if these tensions become real tensions.
Because the Gulf, as I said, represents sixty percent.
In a country far from oil-producing nations.
You will see how the effects come back to haunt the oil market.
It could be as much as three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
More than a hundred ruses a day means...
These tensions in the region and their anticipation
April, as has been said before, will be the month to end this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, Chinese.
In the area because now
This year is the year of elections.
And the current American administration still has only a few months left.
George H.W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see, but we do not anticipate events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America will not pay anything, it's you who will pay as well as Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on Africa's oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, there's nothing, let's talk clearly.
I said in the introduction that sixty percent
Oil reserves
But now they export 22...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and what they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves
Deep-sea or marine water production from the depths of the vast oceans.
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
Caspian Sea oil
And I consider them dreams, because they are neither reality nor truth.
They spoil it and ruin it.
The important means there
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), making these countries difficult to count.
And countries need energy.
It certainly means there's something called secure supply.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of the general public.
But there are still some concerns.
"About President Bush that they
Try to notice how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
It means she didn't come. No, no, no. It's not about generosity because none of us deal with generosity.
No, there's too much generosity in the deal.
But not "in the current field"
We weren't part of a charity.
Or be generous.
But Karim is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With America accurately.
Where the market is.
We go where there are economic returns.
We won't win.
Like oil and gas
You'll do it for kindness' sake.
I have the evidence.
I have the evidence.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
Not the rise in prices.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are ranked first among the people of the GCC countries and OPEC.
That the export must be in dollars and you refuse.
Currency exchange despite the collapse of the currency and thus
Even if the response is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's the experts' talk, not mine.
Okay, the dollar has fallen by 30% and oil has risen more than this decline.
So if we take the base year as 4400...
We see oil prices ranging from thirty-five to thirty-six dollars.
Certainly means
Oil raised its price.
But it's a minor increase, Your Honor.
That means if we take it.
We consider it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to the year 2004.
The rate of decline has even exceeded the rate of decline of the US dollar.
The interesting thing is
React to the dollar's depreciation.
Whenever the dollar falls, the price of oil rises.
This is also something the market has started to feel.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the downturn two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and there is more.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
So the question is why peg your currency to the dollar
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historic age.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
You say America in the mid-seventies.
Removed the gold backing from the U.S. dollar.
Likewise, it is not true.
ok then say little by little
The OPEC organization includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share in the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes 85 million barrels
Dealing with the dollar in oil pricing
If you price it in another currency, everyone will understand.
You can't
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states are the stars of the Middle East.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
Reserves, but I consider them an export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under OPEC
Her share of the market does not exceed forty percent.
Non-OPEC producer and exporter
And this cannot be linked to forty percent.
He can't do that alone unless...
There are some countries that tried but...
Not a real attempt.
It's you who is rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
Before, he only produced one barrel.
It's a pity if they import it.
His currency's price rose sharply.
And the sale of its oil in dollars.
Upon receipt, either at his entrance or destination, get his money in dollars and then convert it to his local currency.
Its currency is not tied to the dollar.
Real, but...
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you won't have a problem.
The main question now is: What is my main question now?
What are the concerns and implications of pegging a currency to the dollar when the dollar is in decline?
He has been engaged for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had great authority.
This withdrawal is not easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here.
Divorce has its costs.
That works in favor of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf finance saying that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman left the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones and I don't believe it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been dismissed.
He said yes and that there will be a study, but all Gulf countries must also be involved.
Profit and loss must be examined with great care, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for examination until they come.
I can bring you other economists who can provide another study.
That contradicts this study.
The global home said something very simple and organized, and it was issued in a report on March 8.
Less than four days have passed.
The global house is the simple solution and needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
His intentions or the five with Kuwait, regarding his intentions in 2010 to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to withdraw from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
For the Gulf Unified Currency
This currency will be strong.
It will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
And what will come of massive reserves and revenues.
That's what the Prime Minister focused on when he said...
Gulf countries, because no single nation can do it alone.
Unless there is strong economic content.
And even today's economic growth, up to the euro, we see it.
Of course, you must not forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In assessment
Determining profit and loss
From all this news
A tense situation.
2008, as observers said, Global House said that this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have increased salaries by seventy percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflation process that
And here is my question now: when will you raise the salaries of those poor people?
I'll listen to your answer after a short commercial break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, Saudi Arabia
It has reserves of 264 billion.
And two out of ten barrels.
Producing nine out of ten daily.
One million, one hundred, one and a half, produces a billion, produces twenty-seven million.
Qatar has fifteen and nineteen billion and produces eight hundred and fifty thousand, and Oman has five and fifteen billion and produces seven hundred and seven thousand.
Bahrain has one hundred and twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand.
The total revenue was $38 billion annually.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in 2006 was seven hundred and seventeen.
The gross output in 2007 is expected to be 799.7 billion.
2008, 912 and one in ten billion
And this is with inflation continuing to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will rise to 8.3 percent in 2008.
Kuwait 14% but in 2008 it is expected to be 8 and 9 out of 10 United Arab Emirates
Six and a half, while Saudi Arabia is six and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are eaten up.
So, what amounts and percentages will you give to the poor here?
If we wanted to solve the problem
Real solution
Always increasing salaries.
The solution is not that.
I'm not against raising salaries.
Neither is true, I, neither is true.
We always
Of course, there is a belief.
In the case of an increase, the rise without controlling inflation will cause inflation to eat up all these increases.
To solve inflation, there is a special committee comprising all experts and specialists.
And now this committee is forming.
Because wage increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics states
It won't end.
And to hate himself, as long as that lasts.
Substantial salary increases, no matter the increments.
Deflation will increase.
The solution is necessary and must be found.
With a scientific study here from Bait.com, a specialized recruitment institute, which conducted a study with the help of the British Yougov Siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially for experts and those who have jobs there, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
Consider moving from these countries where inflation continues to devour incomes.
Now you will lose
This simple concept and putting the simple concept and trying to implement it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The scale is available.
There
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are trying our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they only aggravate it.
Increase means
We hope to get more time for this committee to come up with something.
All applications
This is boredom and your happiness.
Boredom will always exist.
True, but the government tried and raised wages by forty percent.
No, there's an important point here regarding raises.
As for the increases, you only ask the Qataris as if the non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
Consider Qataris but do not consider non-residents.
The higher proportion is in it.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not Germany.
And everyone is talking about this and suffering.
A higher-paying alternative to the public sector.
On the contrary, we have seen
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector became
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in an oil field.
About work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the rate of increase in salaries?
Please be with God the Almighty, but we say
The government has a plan.
And I say to the arbitrators that control over inflation is more important.
Then a temporary solution.
And we'll see, I'm sure.
That there will be
Positive result
It will be around fifteen percent.
The second nice report says that 22 billion in oil will come to you and 43 billion in gas.
No comment, it's not a spraying operation.
The procedure and of course we
But discussions about economic growth should also reflect on the people.
Today, any economic growth has been reversed; Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And the reverse is true.
The giant carriers in the country are also part of that.
And if it weren't for these massive "carriers" and big projects.
In this country, it will also not be part of inflation.
Led to some inflation
This also led to a lot of criticism in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, thus the stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
In fact, it's a good episode and a good title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it tries to make against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
And the American inability also reached sixty billion dollars with Japan.
Japan has already invested in two thousand projects.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union at over $27 billion.
To align with American policy and make the dollar an indispensable currency for the entire world.
I tell my brother to buy now.
And the Gulf region transformed into
As a place
Thank you, Brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Peace be upon you, Your Excellency the Deputy with you.
The rulers of the Middle East, Your Majesties, remind me of...
When there is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjust salaries against prices as you said, Your Excellency.
In Qatar, we used to consider you a prototype.
And he continued not to promise an increase, that is the Arab pattern.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Treika.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? It's certainly his right, as he is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Excellency must take into consideration.
This is his reaction in one second, he should respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people from countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who do not care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to His Highness.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, that's great.
Thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar and we are certain.
And ruling that Qatar agrees with his statement that the funds go to the ruling family and the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's first answer the brothers.
Cannot judge
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities like Al-Lusail and Al-Wakrah and other places, which means that Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case, the case is not like this.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we have two more minutes, tell us what Qatar will do.
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because it is he.
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's trend in the State of Qatar.
The capital in the Middle East in education.
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city houses some of the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because oil and gas today
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not only the island, but a hundred islands will be made, and of course we do not support the island.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, everyone remembered the 1970s boom.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
And this calls for a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
Thanks to our vision about oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I congratulate the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, and I greet you without boundaries. Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
A warm greeting from the Qatari capital, Doha, this week.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
And the Emir of Qatar is the only Arab leader
Those who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, which were destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006.
And the unlimited support for the restoration of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar achieved reconciliation.
With its older sister, Saudi Arabia, for about two years.
Simultaneously, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanon file in which he succeeded when others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Also difficult files.
Who wanted to be the engine of these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is based.
And to whom is the benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and in terms of population, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable him to do that?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister of Qatar and the Foreign Minister.
And for viewers who wish to participate, they can call us on the display numbers that will appear on the screen afterwards.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's voice advocates for improving communications with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its version published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not
What I believe is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I've always said that the precise thing is that
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
In addition to
And different viewpoints.
It is true that the border issue has been a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari ties were special.
These relationships, if we observe them.
Between the two countries and both families.
Devastated by the misunderstanding
Neither we nor they
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
This has been done, and now relations are in a state that I can confirm is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council.
But how did relations improve between Qatar and Saudi Arabia when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason in 2001?
There is an important point.
And repeat if you return to all the programs I always say
Not just the older sister, but I was saying that our reliance in the Gulf Cooperation Council is on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There were some heated media exchanges, and that was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
He failed when the brothers agreed.
And especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
But they found themselves in conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone involved in this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, let me put things in perspective or dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has, in the past two years,
At the time when the cases criticized on Al Jazeera's screen were still ongoing.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia?
Are the arrested people, the opponents, or others still standing?
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has turned into
Praise for the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of difference.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter. Don't ask me because I
That brings together the two countries.
To stabilize the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the guardian of the two sacred mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in perspectives
No, it's about politics, and politics is all about perspectives.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A war of some sort
That is in the developed world.
Around the same interest
I have stayed for many years now.
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this topic and the other.
The idea of a small country challenging the larger nations and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And the cause is more than that.
Due to the wisdom of our two leaders.
Is there insurance for future relationships?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and the interests that unite the two countries.
And the leaders, their speech is considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We greatly hope that this Saudi-Qatari relationship will develop.
The best will be and there will be more fields.
Therefore, the relationship is like the one we have with other Arab countries, and other Gulf countries.
Qatar is an important country.
Okay, so Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that at the same time you are getting reconciliation with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera is a channel.
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And his interest
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this is the case.
Someone will think that through this case we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say about respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people
We believe he is a good person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
We are haunted by the accusation that we are planning to overthrow Gaza, and I do not believe it.
And we do not engage.
In cases that belong to other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you interfered with Hamas' takeover of Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny it. In fact, we didn't know any more about this thing than others did from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or was there a disagreement between you on this point?
I will go to this.
Hezbollah is a conspiracy.
Hezbollah and
But I'm talking about my country.
We were utterly amazed by this subject.
Thank you, Qatar Charity.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids spoke.
Attacking Egypt and its position.
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they mentioned.
The days will reveal this.
It didn't start from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back to our conference in Almina.
After the Madrid Conference, do you remember the summit held in Doha?
That was an agreement, and when the conference was about to be held with us.
They said we don't want to hold the conference.
People, we know that you are cooperating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What we're trying to understand is why.
We sit and talk, and talking is always good.
It has two parts.
Who are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the Algaza conference that was held
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the leaders, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We have been informed by a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have a viewpoint on the issue that he should not be detained.
And people are killed while we watch.
If you don't want it to be held in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It is a shame to discuss the issue at the Kuwait sub-conference.
In Israel and the Western world, they stand and watch what happens.
When we all said "yes," and now this is a common matter, and there is no power or strength except in God, we Arabs cannot stop it, and no major state has stopped this fighting.
Egypt calls for a halt to fighting in Gaza; fighting stops within an hour.
Even we
We should not take the Arab street so naively, our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
That is in accordance with international standards.
And the inadequacy of hospitals and doctors who are detained at the borders.
It was you who stood at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
The brothers didn't take it well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
And we hope a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza
The Europeans tried to save him.
What happened in Gaza
Whether it's a conference that provides and so on, I consider it a salvation for the government.
We were not invited to the conference, but we were invited to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
But it will instead be issued to
Affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and that was it.
Because entry is prohibited from every side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Just give me two minutes.
One minister boasted of what had been rejected and said
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail, they only talked about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
Summarization in the Arab World
We agreed.
For the King to decide that this is in the higher interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them is an insult even to those who did stop.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
The maximum has been reached.
He believes he must impose his strength.
We are sorry, sorry for this.
If you believe that a small state has no rights, then its rights are being taken away from it.
And you enter and put your noise in Darfur.
It's an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah is a conspiracy along with Qatar.
A plot I don't know what in Qatar
If that happens, perhaps after the swine flu appears somewhere, Qatar will be the cause of the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position regarding our main issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a recipient.
Even our analyses have become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there's one thing we know about, we know what happened in Pakistan.
So I want someone to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Qatar has not wronged any Arab country.
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I can pass by to say "peace be upon you" and you will say: "You greet to provoke me."
This is another case that means you have a problem or you have a shortage.
This matter concerns you, not me.
But if you have internal problems
We always say that.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know that this man is trustworthy.
A man speaks what's on his mind.
My heart always says this.
I always say this.
He said, "I always say, even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say that."
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island, but
The matter is different, no, no.
We are one part, so we said no, this is what we said, we stop at this case.
We tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
Let them see their own affairs and where their mistakes lie.
Seeing our mistakes does not mean that everything we have is correct.
Are you referring to this, Your Highness Sheikh?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to break its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we can, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
You played a role in the Shalit soldier case despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you were fighting alongside the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
We said to our brothers, "There is an issue we must address," and they replied, "This matter concerns the Egyptians."
We want to see this issue as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see another part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions applied, the brothers should speak to the brothers in Egypt.
We have stated this, I mean, is there any official who can say that we have, in the sense that we deceived the Arab League.
This means he is a poor man.
How did we let this happen?
To allow President Mahmoud Abbas to stay.
And we supported that.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I did not own the island as they accused me.
The island must enter the media competition, as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media entities, and in adolescence they all curse each other.
But after a while, they will reach maturity.
It may be or it may not be.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a peculiarity between Egypt and any other Arab country, Egypt is the largest country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a difference in policies at points of view.
I told you the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second thing is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar has done to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And with what was leaked to the newspapers, they said at first it was a secret forum, then we found it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irreversible discontinuation
And I cannot tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it won't be interpreted by anyone because you don't compare yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that Egypt had obtained the appropriate satisfaction.
Satisfaction among children
I don't think Egypt is that big, I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to discuss divine intervention or otherwise, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I pray.
Someone tricked him into thinking there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt.
There must be a certain way.
He will stand with me or against me.
And every pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we suffer from this, and it is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power and the sources of France's power and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
"Which is clearly"
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one will take us.
For Israel, it has now been calmed.
Before I go to Israel.
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America if I can tell you about the big countries you were talking about.
They talk to us based on interest, and we do too.
All complaints and everything
To ruin the relationship
I think any great power that does that will affect its image.
And that will also affect our Arab pride if we complain about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we are here for them if they want something.
Are there any steps besides repairing relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If there's someone pulling the strings.
Opposing the interdependence of the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself losing.
No, it might be tomorrow, it might be in ten years, I really don't know, but from our side, if we're invited to a conference, we'll be there.
Everyone invites us to a conference that we will attend, and if we have a point of view, we will express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our elder sister, but we have viewpoints and discuss together.
This is all that is required. When the time comes, we will be very happy.
That was canceled due to this policy.
And as I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you're asking about the number of contracts that were cancelled, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, last June 4th, you stirred the feelings of Arab countries when you closed the Israeli office, and that was published in the arts on June 4th.
Why do you say we closed it down if we wanted to close it down, but we would have closed it down 12 years ago.
When everyone was pushing for reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation between most Arabs
With Israel, either under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to touch emotions, we should have touched them at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner at the Israeli embassy for Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this banquet, and I don't know what reason the ambassador had for holding it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the pain of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egyptian issue, but unfortunately
It wasn't me, but you.
My question concerns the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Jad is serious about solving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Qatari Emir spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran despite its poor relations with the United States.
First, we must place it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you think the agreement is still valid, or do you need to reach a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would enable them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day and minute by minute until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
Because we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have something to do with the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and how much they enjoy visiting it.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen
I interfered in the Hawdhan case, and there are some accusations that you supported them.
Or that it puts you in their direct confrontation with the state, and now there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the South.
We have suffered a lot, and this indicates why we stand here and not there in Qatar.
We faced a lot of pressure, but this was our vision and His Highness the Amir's stance.
Houthi subject
Its stability affects us positively and its disturbance affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if the intention is to use this for other reasons.
And we were with them, and we always stood by them in all circumstances.
Not based on truth
I see that we have no need.
We sell them.
I say this with an apology, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewer, thank you also for listening, hoping that we have clarified some of the foreign policy of the State of Qatar.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you and welcome to this special meeting.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say a special and unusual interview? That's because...
Qatar and this particular man were the main sponsors.
Sir, one simple and direct question.
I think that happened because of an Arab consensus from the beginning.
We tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was significant.
To achieve some results
It is very important that there be external interventions.
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and global, if you want to say.
He went through stages, but it means
There is nothing unless it means that these stages existed.
Does that mean the complications are in Lebanon?
It's time for truth.
I mean when you were a community and now you've directly entered the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
I discovered that the Lebanese complex is huge.
Lebanese Arabic is a regional international language that requires significant decoding.
Or it's a simple complication, but it's been magnified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
It's not up to the Lebanese to allow that.
To affect peace and security in Lebanon
The first thing to be dealt with is the first problem.
Are the effects external in Lebanon?
I suddenly decided after 24 hours to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect that, they couldn't rest for a single minute unless you were kind enough to let them.
The secret is not to let them rest and think too much.
And making a lot of calls.
We are suggesting bringing them to Doha because we need a suitable atmosphere.
Or gather them with a lot of difficulties.
In many cases
We are taking them out of these circumstances into conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly
God has granted us success through the Venetian Statement or the Beirut Statement.
We succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some thought that Qatar was more biased towards one party over the other.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
The policy His Highness followed was that if we are mediators,
In this process
"Okay, honestly"
Did you consult seriously?
With at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He has shown his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud, who we are.
Everyone needs a solution.
His reasons are weak.
If we relied on logic
His reasons are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
There is a case regarding the Iranian nuclear issue.
The Arab Committee must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at resolving issues?
And try to unite the parties.
And hold conferences to find solutions, why can't the Arabs, with their ancient ties, do that?
An Arab summit or a summit of parties, if there is one, or intervention to support the oppressed.
That should be under study.
If we wanted to get a wake-up call for the Arab League, not for the university for the Arab world.
The Arab Committee is merely an instrument for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is President Nbeh Barry.
The letter "s" is required.
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
We listen, we are listening.
And at the pinnacle of these, Qatar.
Never led to any result.
In the interest of the Arab world
It will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We're trying that.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Convention.
Agendas made for resolution, not other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And a more important role in the entire Arab world
To place
Stop that pursuant to our agreement.
For others to come and help us
Because this is a serious matter, but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our backyard?
In our courtyard
It is extremely important to put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What will we do for Somalia?
What will we do for Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small one.
I want to be this, not suggesting this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that if we're not asked to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because Saudi Arabia and Syria have historically agreed.
It can only be a transient stage.
And we will find, God willing.
I still insist on asking if it's okay with you to take a role in this play.
Even if you're not in public places now, you kind of have confidence.
What rapprochement between Arab states do we seek?
This has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
Does what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is on the verge of serious changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese matters that are still linked to the region.
He did not comment on this case.
I want the opposite, I want this to be.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
In another sense, Your Excellency, are you afraid of the escalation that existed before?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There is no doubt that I still have concerns about Palestine, now the issue of Gaza.
I want to ask
That's not what we need.
Ask me to take care of the human side in Palestine.
We can't deliver the medicines to them.
No food, no water.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
What will die when the electricity is cut off.
I want
The Arab League agrees to allocate an amount for this food and medicine, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
What I want to say is that as Arabs, we should deliver medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
Saudi Arabia has made a tremendous effort and pledged at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
Their claim that we shouldn't deal with this party because "we will find a solution for you" is not correct.
And I
So far, I have no clues to the solution.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian meeting in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want to have relations or contacts with Israel.
Some might consider you an integral part of it due to the American bases located there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia,
He may have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, from the negotiations between Syria and Israel
And I can say that it was a coincidence.
The second subject was that the Saudi kingdom was keen to find a solution to it, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours.
Changing tactics is changing negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible for
And we came from all sides and locked ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was very important.
And that's the interfering work that's being done.
Without mentioning it now, it's over.
And his message was clear when he said that we know our size, our place, our role, etc., as if to say:
I wanted to play a role without provoking any other party.
Is he Arab, national, or regional?
But nevertheless
I became responsible.
Did you want that or not?
We are trying to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
These countries
It can be done or
I believe this will be the profitable combination.
Last question, what is the nature of your relationship with Washington? Is it long-term, ordinary, or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
That doesn't mean we don't have different views in cases.
But this is our right. If they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good it is, how can you interpret it on earth?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Also health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and explain that in the next phase.
In my opinion, let's set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the Arab court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective.
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome, viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their Arab efforts.
Welcome, Sheikh Maali.
To find out what's happening in Gaza.
And I share with you my hope that we can achieve this through this dialogue.
Shed light on some of your questions.
The Israeli crossing into Gaza in a brutal manner.
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Treatment of friendly states
And other sister countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance that Arab countries commit to?
And then, we find the reconciliation areas.
We know from our position that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
And no one was punished while
We are punished for everything, whether intentional or unintentional.
We are the specialists.
In the world and the only ones always targeted
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
To the extent that we won't be able to
For a meeting at the leadership level
To halt the discipline campaign
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world.
There were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They want it to be right and we see that our perspective is wrong because the goal
To solve the problem, not to hold a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now is that the ministerial meeting not reject Qatar's request.
Which His Highness also confirmed.
In the speech he delivered, we do not insist on it being in Qatar if it will cause any embarrassment, we do not insist on the summit being in Qatar, it can be anywhere.
An Arab stance where others respect us.
Yes, ministerially.
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He did not participate in making the decision and continued to kill and bomb Gaza, and he is still doing it.
And I need to ask the Arab what we will do about it.
What will we do?
Is it when Israel ends?
For the application of the remainder of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a halt because Israel did not stop.
"Firearms, we don't force our brothers."
To a decision that is considered above
A few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You will eventually support this.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our idea, and some other countries, Syria and Yemen, requested the summit.
Exactly, there is already an Arabic gap.
Or they divided us into the camp of moderation.
And the immoderate camp
And what does their lack of moderation mean?
That was a problem solved by the West.
Medians and non-medians of Arabs
You won't find a moderate state or a non-moderate state.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And ending the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we just need to leave the case open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are these countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in Israeli ways.
What I'm saying is that they're not following Israel's plans, and I don't want to blame anyone.
But I say
If we name the camp of moderates
What is moderation in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree to the slaughter of a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from the perspective of existence.
The current reality is the existence of
Idea
What some people call the radical movement
But we must ask ourselves what this radical current wants.
For something other than her rights or is she claiming her rights?
Or we'll arrange it.
And created other audiences as well.
Against because we
Internal and intellectual
And it has started happening.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, Sheikh, in brief.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say it's completely unknown, there are some efforts and the subject is somewhat known.
The subject is prevention.
But as I said, we can have
Count one vote and get two-thirds.
But that wasn't the goal because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, and that's what we believe.
Others believed it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel said it would end and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
Changes sometimes cause disagreements.
As much as
Will we be ready to have a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
And also addressing the Israeli party and informing them
I don't think everyone is ready for that, we need to investigate that.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four, and we were committed to the truce. Eighty-four, and the Israelis were not committed.
In fact, these disagreements during meetings are normal, but in her capacity as...
Representing their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the reported quarrels is
There is a person who described Hamas' movement as spreading.
Not even a few of them.
This case occurred and we received it, and one of the ministers was with me.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are the radical movements, fragmentation, and other names.
We do not want to be other people's men.
That always means, and I don't mean anyone by that.
Which foreigner did they find?
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
Among the Arabs
Okay, Your Highness Sheikh.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, in all of this, and what is the stance of your nation, which numbers over three hundred million?
One million Israeli products.
Issued after Resolution 1068
The issued decision.
Israel has not carried it out, and will carry it out after completing the mission.
Undoubtedly, the Arab delegation made an effort.
Who you should be grateful to for this decision.
Let us demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And if they are questioned, they will say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they are
If that's the case, Israel won't be asked.
That is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try to reassure us.
He needs to make a tough decision.
Decision made by the Board of Directors.
An official may be removed from office.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work diligently after they make the decision.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq completely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
Let's demand the Iraqi government, not the people who died.
No compensation.
Exactly the same thing in Sudan when they started talking about Bashir's trial.
Happiness Your
Venerable Sheikh
A great diplomatic victory for the Arabs in the Security Council.
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Results
Israel did not comply with it.
He will adhere to it in two days, after a week, after the mission is completed.
Because they didn't collect with him.
I'm sorry, but people have to gather.
Because Israel agreed after it had finished the mission.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and I'm not ashamed that we have any relationship with the West, and I am not.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
And in the end, they'll take one percent from our perspective, and we'll say we won.
What is victory?
With all that it contains.
I cannot say anything about precautions now because the decision was not...
And the body is its own master.
I participated in the training.
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went are enough.
She pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, Your Highness Sheikh
For two years now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I cannot hide that we were not aware of everything.
If they were people who
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there the conflict began and the siege started.
And last month, Israelis killed 28 Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they lose patience because we don't want them in power.
Those parties are your happiness, O Sheikh.
Clearly mention that the Palestinian conflict
I mean, if there is
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
To express someone's opinion, you are not always one hundred percent right.
I didn't say Hamas was one hundred percent right.
What I claim is what I said and what I say.
But, the average is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not only the average, but also as Arabs, we are equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want it to exist, so we must stop it by any means necessary.
Once upon a time, training soldiers right and left.
And once by besieging them and not granting them funds or salaries.
And since we have created a positive space in the West Bank.
To show people in Gaza how people live.
Luxury living
While the opposite is true in Gaza.
A second Arab ministerial meeting was called, but this time...
The discussion is still ongoing about him, with Hamas mediating through Turkey.
This meeting you were invited to attend seems to want to trick you.
That would be tantamount to deception if we took another initiative.
We didn't have initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
He calls for playing a role and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But the important thing
Do not come.
Tomorrow with a party seems as if another party has won.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements from Egypt's roles, which are important roles.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what is required of Egypt?
The current proposals, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for this initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency that should be there, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Those injured in another accident should also have their say.
To be able to accomplish these intermediate tasks.
By the way, to take a viewpoint.
Hamas is clear in its position that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how could it be issued?
The decision to involve the Arabs in its formation was made without consulting or seeking the opinion of the main party concerned.
We only want, of course, to deal with the State of Palestine as a state.
We deal with the authority as a monolithic entity.
But now there is a split in one party somewhere and in another party somewhere else.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we will have to stop dealing with people in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced about him?
First, regarding the resolution, he did not mention a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some consider it as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from my reading of this decision, it welcomes the initiative of the Egyptians.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving its goals.
That stops the fighting.
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this decision to be non-existent since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things on the ground will have changed.
Yes, Your Excellency, the Sheikh is talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or the Arab conflicts that cannot be resolved, and thus came to fill the void.
Supposed to be filled by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A stance that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people should follow him.
There is no Arabic pronoun to resolve the situation.
One says, "Let's finish the mission."
There must be a clear Arab stance, a clear cut to all this aggression, its continuation and delay.
There is an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can delay the decision, I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are the people who always call for peace.
And we are a nation that loves to dwell in peace.
But I do not call for an Arab war, I call for a just peace.
The State of Qatar issued an official statement regarding the clear Arab position.
In the context of initiatives and proposals, you are certainly following what is happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an on-the-ground observer.
And the policy resulting from the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on this point.
The second thing
All I know about these negotiations, as I told you, is that they are not there. Oh, now they are negotiating.
The second thing
ok at the required sites by Arabs
This is the Arab reality.
We witnessed that after the commencement of those operations.
It seems that the Arab street has taken a very advanced position.
As governments, we have...
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe the people's gift as...
The last time they told me this is the problem.
Representing the views of the people.
Now chiefs.
I mean, if they want to.
At least they tell what.
Of course, there is a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
Closing the Israeli representative office in Doha
Qatar, which takes this stance.
Consider that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever is agreed upon by the Arabs will be a collective agreement.
Undoubtedly, if we have an Arab agreement.
A treaty is one thing, relations are another.
We are ready.
To get closer to our Arab brothers
If there is a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that have nothing.
It's very important.
Do not be agents for others.
He says why shouldn't Qatar be a role model in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to join it.
But we also want
Qatar is committed to part of its Arab commitment.
For example
And no one sells one to the other
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to tell them our secret. I don't want to inform the intermediaries.
Therefore, it is very important.
To handle formal invitations anywhere because we should rise above it.
Some called the ambassador, some protested, and some expelled the ambassador, just like Chávez did.
That's part of the dispute.
But some demanded the ambassador who summoned the permanent member states, and these are all films about our people.
We discussed the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
For high expectations, some call for opening fronts, and some call on Syria to open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not want to fight Israel.
To start a fight with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
That which makes us speak to one another and that which overcomes our differences.
What you said, Your Highness, caught my attention.
On condition that countries do not sell each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street won't spare us.
Venerable Sheikh
What is happening today is the completion of a project that began in 2006 during the Lebanon War.
Or there is a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon was a free land.
Some parts are still supposed to be a deposit for the United Nations, of course.
Or something like that.
Lebanon, I mean that we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
Therefore, he controls and has the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them, and they are foreign countries.
That's why you want to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
For the purpose of changing this example with Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you talk to?
And how many sides?
In Palestine, there is only one side.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to too many Arabs and foreigners.
And from there the difference began, and everyone thought he would control the other part.
In your opinion, as a follower and observer
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we agree to this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Or express his opinion.
Are Israelis or others in the future?
We set a high example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral example: I and my brother against my cousin; I, my brother, and my cousin against the world.
Now we are assumed in any dispute with Hamas, and I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else is perfect in committing any mistake.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must set this matter aside.
Bring a part to his knees.
Because failure here will not be a failure of the group.
Sheikh Qatar, whom I have known for some time, was trying to make suggestions.
The initiatives that were launched to find solutions took place in Lebanon.
What happened in Darfur we will talk about this in a moment even in a hurry
We translate
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are some sensitivities.
That one nation will take all these initiatives, we don't care as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar front-page news.
None of His Highness's goals were.
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
End the dominance.
What happened is beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To achieve a solution worthy of honor.
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative regarding Darfur said about the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
It will mainly be about resolving the Darfur issue because the Darfur issue is at its inception.
The Arab people helped.
But we are not raising an issue we have made international.
Based on revenge against the regime, and we now want to solve the problem, but we don't know how.
As I mentioned earlier, we always strive to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
Remove the issue from the competition. Is there also a competition in the Darfur issue?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we summarize the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend it?
No, we will attend the summit.
We would have liked it to be held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
This won't be a shame.
Agree if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, and they met there for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances. Of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
And for safety.
But no one takes a person in their pocket.
Hamd bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, thank you very much.
Dear viewer, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So what is the usefulness of this celebration and the truthfulness of the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What about our Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this cause?
These questions and others will be asked of our guest in today's episode.
Former Special Envoy for the United Nations Conference on Disability
She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt.
And held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
2089
And he has been the Vice President of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1990.
2003 to 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
He also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Ms. Hessa, welcome to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we called them disabled, perhaps in the 1980s or earlier.
The most educational concept when...
Among those who provide them with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in nineteen ninety-nine.
"Let's translate the term and before we go into the details"
From other regions, although there are regions that are not or are not classified as developing countries and are classified as poor.
Especially Latin America, where this trend is actually the strongest in any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise.
A trend towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and has been found in many countries.
It may also be possible to have the resources and political will.
Okay, let me tell you that some statistics you might already know about her.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with disabilities from poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Hassa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
It's largely true.
I have seen in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas prone to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, you can't distinguish between a disabled person and a non-disabled person because they are in such large numbers.
In fact, children with female illiteracy, for example, are almost fifty-five or forty-five.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from accessing school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have the infrastructure even if this child finds the school.
He can't reach her.
For the benefit of children and other residents
These plans and projects are great, but we barely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago, what is the purpose of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities.
There are organizations that have arrived and organized numerous projects.
Implementing a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and it is better.
We stand at the point of awareness to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask since she's been to the United Nations before.
Second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against regimes that hinder society, such as the Syrian intelligence regime, for the sake of the child now.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the entire regime as is the case in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraff is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If you allow me, I am one of the people who suffer from a mental and intellectual disability.
Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
And this is from the saying of Allah, the Most High and the Most Merciful, that Allah, the Mighty and the Majestic, has given us speech, and praise be to Him who gives speech to all things.
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
God is great, He made me speak.
I was talking about the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without knowing they're at the bottom of hell.
I just got slandered.
And not telling the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls within the same definition.
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
To consult with them, convince them, and find out the extent to which they have reached.
There are disability issues and situations on their work agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already addressed disability.
It's one of the programs that try to keep disabled children from falling through the cracks.
With good opportunities and schools.
From different environmental perspectives
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings. We must acknowledge that there are also shortcomings in the United Nations.
What are the most important weaknesses and imbalances you've mentioned?
United Nations Organization
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered it.
My work is sometimes private, even during restrictions or shortages.
Fighting or trying to fight against people with disabilities for recognition.
Until he reached a somewhat satisfactory level, but he did not place it in a separate article as the global disability movement wanted.
But he occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of its main flaws.
The questionnaire, which was developed by the Special Rapporteur and sent to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies, and only three responses reached us.
Do not put.
The issue of disability is a persistent and ongoing concern that has spanned many years, even though it is fundamentally a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has at least been brought to the fore through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international regulations?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating salaries for people with disabilities.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN offices, and will this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
The final opinion, if there are no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Al-Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Hello, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
She may adopt this proposal.
Writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Let's put it in this box.
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of annual net profits
I'm going back to our guest to answer callers' questions.
And he said that doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
It costs a lot and he can't afford it, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be obtained by the citizen.
To register for the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this convention is legal and binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Binding on all states and must be restricted to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At the very least, there should be basic awareness among officials.
It must be at least if we are working on these treaties in this way.
And if there is no significant commitment to that.
Is there a response to the surveillance reports you conduct, and was there any interest?
But don't forget the rules, it's actually a morally binding document, not legally.
He is committed and licensed.
And understand that these cases will be resolved or discussed or will be within the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Najee Zakarna, manager of the National Center for the Deaf, sign language expert at Al Jazeera.
First, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera.
Which broadcast this episode live now.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
And she was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her side always and at all times.
I also say that there are many people with present needs.
Some people don't know about this agreement because there were no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I would emphasize and insist to these countries that
Adopt and sign this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Many thanks, my brother Naji. I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks.
Your opinion may be turned into a decision.
We might start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability.
Establishing a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur when engaged in
Even the Arab countries did not donate, except for one: Syria.
Fulfilling those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, thus
The box
Lack of commitment from member states, unfortunately, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that we don't care about the situation now.
It's actually a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad, general sense.
Marginality in particular
But for this reason, there are those covenants.
For the commitment of these countries to their obligations, but it is a good idea to make it the brother.
Moreover, it is essential that there not be a separate box, meaning independent in form, but rather existing organizations in the region.
What they have in their budgets
Providing private projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistive devices for people with disabilities
The issue always involves political factors.
His state or government has guaranteed significant support.
Unfortunately, it reduces the number.
With token amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, revoking citizenship.
They took his beloved from him.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
We get disoriented when we travel or go out.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge
I hope that Arab countries will allocate from their budget
Thank you very much, I'm from Kuwait.
Welcome, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah, daughter of Khalifa.
I just want to send her a letter of thanks and appreciation.
In past years
With our warmest wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
For Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa's continuous support
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
There is another level, and that is the genetic one.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a male cousin always marries his female cousin.
In this way, at this level, a level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
Essentially, as I said, at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Fall within healthcare services
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
I believe within the psychiatric clinic and the Supreme Council for Education programs as well.
The Special Education Department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists or not.
But certainly within healthcare services, yes, there is support and there are medical services.
The qualifications presented for these cases
Prevention is better than cure, and it points to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage, are there campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And one of the things that I and others have addressed with many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not just targeted.
The World Health Organization carried that out.
And likewise for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
It has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do these campaigns get any positive reaction?
Especially when it goes against customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty when you bump into the collective culture.
He has a resolution to have strategies to have the will to deal with it and sticks to it.
The problem of early detection, for example, because this is a very important issue before marriage.
Do you have statistics on people with disabilities?
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
Arab regions
And especially
With the recent events that have taken place in the region
In regions, conflict zones, and during wars, especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
For every person killed, there are three disabled.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
Certainly not enough, and first the problem.
With the principles of human rights
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Agendas within institutions in government ministries and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only to your words, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay.
In the world and the strangest is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of People with Disabilities said that the census...
To this extent, persons with disabilities are not included in the statistics, which are kept for residents only.
They won't always announce it.
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think that was more than five years ago.
But frankly
The planning committee, in collaboration with them, is working on developing a new plan for the area.
The Council prepared it indeed, with our participation, like the Special Rapporteur's office.
To create more classifications for disabilities.
Needs that are supposed to exist.
Types of those needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are advancing in a way in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Lady, thank you for this program and thank you to Sheikhah Hessa.
But thank God I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Its motivational role and its role in making us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those who rely on this category.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of our Qatari children's sheikha?
I hope you can answer this question.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
I bear witness to what the State of Qatar has provided as a special service to the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
To bring together civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities
Because reality and what we hope for, if you compare it after five years,
What was offered to the disabled five years ago and what is available now.
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan, and now we return to our guest.
Certainly
The public as a whole, with its individuals and especially with its families who have
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But regarding one point you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or anywhere else
The international convention is like many international documents.
Commit to translating it into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Okay, Sheikhaha Hessa, you previously served as a Special Rapporteur, working at the United Nations on disability issues for six years.
Did you want?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of that.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
That will be more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and ended up with more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and extensively.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves, the person with a disability, and their organizations, because they are the ones.
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They fight for.
Many thanks.
Thank you.
Dear viewer, at the end of this program, I congratulate everyone who participated with us with their opinions and comments.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and writings in a new episode of "Live" (Live) Goodbye
Good morning
I'm very happy to have you with us.
First, before we start asking different questions and chatting this morning
Thank you, Shaima, maybe I have congratulated.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has indeed significantly influenced the global football landscape.
Thank you, Qatar.
And so does Ali, go Ali!
First, I'd like to greet the viewers in the morning.
I congratulate him and all Qatari citizens on their hosting.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said.
It was a dream, and if God wills, it will become a reality, and work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, don't you have any fear in this field, particularly on this subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said the likelihood of Qatar getting it was seventy percent.
A very powerful installer.
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitors.
Why are we afraid?
But thank God, Qatar's file was really strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 World Cup file and Qatar's hosting.
What about the feelings of the athletes themselves?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I want to speak with %pw, we were talking off-air, but we want to hear that on-air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you hear the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
By radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, and praise be to God, everyone supported us.
When they announced Qatar's win and hosting rights.
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through the media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, shameful.
I went at that time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was taking pictures there.
We also conducted interviews.
Everyone participated, Qatar now, regularly, is mentioned every day.
Hundreds of times a day, in Anjar the small is the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will get to know Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country, by being in the team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wants to represent the team.
It's good to work very hard.
In the league, even when he's in the league, he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, and for this reason, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the officials have put a lot of effort into nurturing young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at various age levels. How was your experience, and which stage was the most important to you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
For each stage has its own mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We're getting used to you like our sports bra.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We loved watching you and getting sports news from you. So, how's sports going for you?
Frankly, I don't find it different from talk shows. In talk shows, we hosted famous stars in their fields, just as in sports we host stars as well.
Like Ali and others in their athletic field.
On the contrary, the mathematical field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
Qatar has now become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of presenting various talk shows on social, economic, and cultural topics.
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
I liked it, excellent.
I truly wanted...
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
I think the young players have gotten a great opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
Similarly tall, what do you want to say to the players?
God bless the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they should take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
Therefore, they have a great advantage over him.
Tell us, what are you doing, what new upcoming shows will you be presenting, I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about the new, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup. By the way, we'd like to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti club.
The newsletter is also available to cover events.
My first media appearance was through Qatari TV, of course, my roots are from Qatari TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Let's convey the media message through various channels.
Whether it's a private channel, a sports channel, or other channels.
So, thank you Qatar TV.
We extend to you our best wishes; we are still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And his supporters, I was at the Al-Wakrah Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
He is still at the club.
I'm still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism
That belongs to every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people already love sports and are addicted to them.
How do we make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
I said that the youth are addicted to it, as schools have become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the roads, and this reflects an awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and elsewhere.
This also points to women's awareness and participation in the field of sports.
We now have a national women's league, for female players.
I believe that sports are evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce massive projects and raise sports awareness, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If taken into consideration and implemented carefully.
Sufficient, and at the same time it must be used wisely as you said.
And also, there's a point, this is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
Also, there's something important, and praise be to God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are renowned for our passion for sports.
How to engage this audience to keep up with sports news, football matches in Qatar.
And attend the matches at the same time
Most Qataris love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When browsing web forums, you'll find that there is a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in football leagues.
As a Qatari citizen, what is the best solution to attract you to attend, aside from being a sports athlete or player?
What are potential ways to attract an audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a home gathering.
For example, Japan, Japan created a wonderful plan to attract the public massively.
When they attend matches, they collect points or the like, so they are looking for solutions, so we hope.
"And in Arabic"
The most important thing is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in 2022, Lana, what do you think we need that for?
Besides financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participate in the massive global World Cup.
Time passes quickly with good people. When the producer told me the time was up, I honestly said, God willing.
We always achieve the impossible, it realizes the dream we thought was impossible, praise be to God, we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed says, they were moments of celebration, but the hard work began.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
2022 Hospitality
Thank you, Lana, the wonderful presenter. I wish you success, and I will always watch your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Talented Qatari Youth
They are singing a new type of music that has become popular lately.
But in a repetitive form with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a rap group of amateurs, God willing.
Stay with us, we start now and good morning
We're trying to take a look at that.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
She performs a recitation, not a rapid rhythmic singing of the song's lyrics.
It consists of numerous poetic verses that address many different topics and issues.
It can sometimes be personal.
Social, emotional, or political.
He is often controversial.
And I'm quite liberal.
The rapper performs, our viewers don't sing the song lyrics.
But he keeps doing it.
He used his voice for praise and considered it a secondary element.
Generally, sound is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or an MC.
Rap singers pay attention to the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and delivery.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rapping.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, there was a period when we wanted to do something new.
To stand out in something.
So we said, why not rap?
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
So, why isn't it in Qatar?
So we said, let's invent something new.
We gave him an idea that included a message.
We are talking about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
We deliver a message first, and secondly, it is an art.
It is one of the various arts, and it is for the viewer. It has addressed many social and psychological issues among young people to a large extent.
Time changes, and this has to do with time zones, I think.
Before, there was little acceptance.
We sing, for about two years and five thousand, acceptance was small at first.
We can say that a new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
There is more acceptance and popularity.
Have you noticed that people love singing and doing things similar to rap style these days?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
There's also something we want to talk about, you are the founders of many teams.
I love the band and I think you have concerts, can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come to someone to form a band, and how many are you in this band?
Initially, we were before the formation of the band.
Rap arrived in Doha starting in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and upload it on the website.
I can download, Salman can download, someone can download, so there was a competition.
We met the people.
So, we started competing with each other.
After a while, and after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, the group system meant that this group alone and every three or four together.
So we said, why not unite as one team under the name Rappers Qatar.
In Qatari Arabic: رابرز Q Rappers.
Therefore we agreed on this, therefore we said under one name and we are all together with one hand.
And we come and present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, a large group.
Does one of you play, or, or, or do you all rap?
Format and composition.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how is this number 25 arranged? How is this number arranged in the band?
Everyone has their own potential.
That means everyone in the band can make a whole song.
Without the help of another person.
But capabilities can differ, for example if Salman is better than me.
Listen to her and tell me how she changes her words, changes something.
Each one may change into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company adopts you, so that an official body adopts these works.
And there will be appropriate distributors.
So the work comes out in a stylish pattern and becomes an official thing for you.
Frankly, we hope to get support, and we got support from a company that came and adopted us to produce an album for us.
We don't have a problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
So, why don't you think the first move should come from you?
Insert the individual into the first compact disc.
In this way, you can later attract companies, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
In 2007, rap might not have been dominant in the Gulf.
But not with the same popularity as it has now.
We were talking before the broadcast, for example, there are large groups like Valencia and Castro.
Are we talking about this?
They said they would organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were amazed and it was a wonderful performance.
But there was little pressure because there were no advertisements and there was nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That was a good point.
This means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea only appealed to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were very numerous.
The entire group
What are words, and how do they deal with different issues?
We are talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
And if they speak, listen.
It must be like this.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms for it.
Okay, you have some songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Listen to it and know the public's opinion.
I hope they love words.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it bears the name of my program.
This is the program of KD and DJ MREldoha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Lady Bobo with Skit, one hot for the body.
Don't forget, the show changes at 9:30, everyone must watch it.
Producer: Hassan Naama, Presenter: Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Malk, and the guests are Qatar Rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you guys!
I have to clap your hands for you and the people in the control room.
We moved him last night.
And who wrote the words, him or me?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
I write them only out of love for singing and passion.
I assume you want to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I assume if you can.
Yes, certainly, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
Assume there are some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are now watching live.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
Therefore, viewers, as we've seen, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned agencies have made all the necessary preparations to host the event.
There may be more crowds.
I suppose they'll crowd along the coastal side.
I'm sure they are ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up?
There's an offer from an agency, they promised to arrange a party for us.
But, there are still some complications.
"Therefore, we are uncertain about some procedures and issues."
So, we try, if you meet Joseph and see.
Some of them, I have a song topic.
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of implementing them.
When I am at home
Then send it to Youssef's email.
This part of the song is dedicated to Youssef.
There's something else, do you travel abroad?
In this field, which has millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who are at the forefront in this field.
But we try to be competitors.
Why don't we take some ideas and copy some things?
But its opposite, I take the idea and apply it in a different way in my song.
Those who formed a band and have more than one record.
Abdullah is the guide.
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
One of the residents of Marath town.
There are many experts.
Those who determine groundwater before drilling.
That requires or may involve drilling some wells where there is no water.
Using copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or figs, through which he can locate water tanks.
What are the tools used?
Groundwater discovery
That was in ancient times.
But now, they have been replaced with copper wires.
So, we place the sticks parallel to each other.
Walk slowly.
We observe, as we walk along the water's course.
The wires will open.
Now, we are crossing the stream.
It opens like this.
When we crossed it, he started it.
Now we are in the middle of a watercourse.
And here, the medium will be.
In this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater present in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site with the highest density.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
At this advanced stage of this profession
In order for his discoveries to be extremely accurate.
In times, outside times, in Shaqura, Hariqla, and Athitiya
Discovered more than one hundred and fifty wells.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
He needs training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpass modern devices and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Murat Ton, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And if Allah Almighty wills it, the Gulf Arab states will cooperate with each other.
And we reached different places and titles, but he has that.
Meaning of concept
Assume there is a large group of Gulf youths in the Gulf.
What specific people do you follow as an example?
Follow instead of imitating her.
There is a general connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, I mean if you produce a song.
Covers a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have connections, but I don't know anyone.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing.
He has fans and CDs.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We extend to you our best wishes for success through this team.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's see some shots from the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
That, even if it quotes from the West, is in the Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band consisting of 25 people.
It's important to follow up with you to find out how you're doing.
If you assume that you have an email, a website, or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close for unclear reasons.
So we faced many problems and eventually closed it.
No use, the site will definitely close.
So what do we do, and what are the alternatives, to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You should communicate with them to find out the latest news and songs produced from time to time.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
By what name?
ok, what are you playing with the names on the names
Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers
You can produce your own video.
بالنسبة للبرنامج، كنت تعمل عليه بالأمس.
I uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
A song and the same thing with pictures
I think we should see more improvement from you.
You need a place for all of you together instead of having equipment in each of your homes.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
Produce a CD.
And a special place was allocated for us.
We work alone.
Ultimately, we're still working on our own project.
This is what we want.
Not different from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
Videos make the song go viral very quickly.
Translates ideas faster.
If there is support, everything else will fall into place eventually.
And your beautiful voice will be everywhere.
It's a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al Naemi and Salman Abdullah, for coming.
Come on, let's see it and put your success ahead of our schedule, guys.
These projects were, yes.
There is also a semi-ready project, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you already have the total and all the details.
Recognizes goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
That's while walking with the cart.
It is connected to the cart, so one can choose the desired item.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings towards an issue.
She has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
It might also be, yes.
That takes him directly to the subway from his home.
But his idea was that it was meant for clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell t-shirts will appear.
It can also be with the car key, so press the button.
You locate the items I've lost and take me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Skills development and talent acquisition
It varies between different children's skills, resources, and research skills.
Personal abilities, such as public speaking, persuading an audience
Capabilities differ, and we have a special program to serve them.
We started with Future Media, did a good job on this project, reached the end, the project graduated.
We also got a number of speaking children and youth.
And their creativity...
Do you have junior broadcasters?
For television, it is important to provide children's programs.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Qatar TV through its television
I support them until they reach the age of eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
And this is the national television.
We need to attract, identify, and nurture these talents.
Media, research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition, Generation Exhibition, is also...
The scientific club played an important role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The Supreme Committee for Education, through its support for schools and partners, played the main role.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
which also includes a variety of activities and clubs
Do you think this is a step forward towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of how vast the place is.
And it facilitates dealing with the public.
They are pioneering and excellent projects.
And in receiving the guest and introducing him to the programs offered to the child
It's our main project for the next three years.
National Program for Reading Development
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted and supported this project.
It's a major project, it's about reading development, writing stories, and child development.
Various cultural skills associated with reading in a specific location.
Because there are definitely different programs.
We have recently moved.
And we are rearranging some activities.
Design and improve it to suit Katara visitors.
We give you luck, through this center.
containing very important ideas
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, his imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They ... %pw, the way they treat their children is like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Or like a bank, saving money.
Children have a real need for someone to listen to those ideas, the imagination.
In recent days, they transported us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for your presence, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
So these projects are realized and are not a dream forever.
Hello ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center was launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
The closing ceremony of the National Future Generations Dreams Exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First, I would like to thank you for giving us the time.
To talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
In contribution from the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the national holiday
Those who had
In an attempt to stabilize the children
Live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
That's why we limited it to twenty to thirty.
And other key areas of Qatar's Vision, 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then consider the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you mean exactly by this expression?
Facts or the nation of tomorrow?
Means, anything a child dreams of today.
It will grow as the project grows.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children would live from that day forward.
With a big dream
In the field of environment, health, human development, or any other field
Serving the state.
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
Economy, there were also guests of honor.
For the sake of the children, they learn from them, as good role models.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, there was *
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here too is the owner of the last project, the forest.
And we also want to talk about the colored ball.
It's a very bright idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
And the smart stadium was also named.
Whenever the ball goes out of bounds.
Colors differ.
Assuming this will greatly help in future matches.
What's next, after all these dreams?
And to be related to things related to his field of interest.
Assume in particular when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But we don't know, maybe these projects will benefit us, what does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Intensely, he visited football-related projects.
Support us and adopt these projects the moment he saw them.
These projects have also been adopted.
That's what our children did, as people voted for many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that people voted for the most in the place where they were located?
There is an evaluation committee that has a way to evaluate projects.
First, second, and third place projects that won awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
She was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, it needs many administrative elements.
There were very fine details in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Certainly the images we see now are the ones we see.
This is part of the big projects.
Maybe they don't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it is being adopted by institutions.
For example, let's call them projects, what are these projects?
To collect, use, and recycle them.
247 students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Majid, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a very dear guest today.
From the Tisanef family, the actor Abdelhamid Charshani.
He proved himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent."
They have worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art does not know flattery.
That means
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I admire the show's actors and
We will listen to a very short scene from one of your works and then we will start talking to you.
Are you laughing at me?
Take the fake coat and bring the original one.
Go and get it.
You have the cloak, you will return it.
What? Give me the best, bring it! How can I bring it?
The goat has already ground it in its stomach, damn it.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't approve of you.
I have no objection.
So now this is a glimpse, a very short part of the Tisanf series, of which we will watch the second part.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your parts that feature the Tisanif series with a different theme in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Certainly, later.
She passed by Marathon at that time.
Marath is also famous with the mountain.
Kuwait, which has been celebrated by poets all the time.
When history is a witness and remembers to stay in cities.
And it shows how wonderful her history is.
One hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe it was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its archaeological sites, the sweetness of its water, and the freshness of its air.
Poets were inspired by him and were enamored with him. He was famous because of the renowned Mount Kumait.
They call it the Spring of Kamit.
Certainly, Marath is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
The one we are in now.
The companion Khalid bin Waleed (may Allah be pleased with him), during the time of the Ridda wars, ordered the digging of this well.
It still remains to this day.
The proverb says: "Guaranteed quantity", and I guarantee you quality.
If you see Kumait, you can see Marath.
Another effect is the Kamit spring.
It won't always be like this, sometimes it's been sweeter over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
And the date of establishment of these monuments is unknown.
There are also the Arous family and there.
Jebel Kmit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marathon.
There were many proverbs, poems, and verses based on these mountains.
Many people from various parts of the kingdom come to it.
One of the most important monuments is the Al-Walidiyah Well.
Because he remained in Marra during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He camped there and ordered the men to dig the well.
Some people still drink from its water and bathe in it.
There is a mention of Khalid in Yaqut al-Hamawi's book, Mu'jam al-Bulan, that he passed through the city of Marrat.
It is an old house made of mud that has been restored to its original condition.
It consists of various sections reflecting the architecture, heritage, and ancient monuments of the region.
The poet once said of it: "When we met water, water for free."
We found Wadi Kamit, not Wadi Al-Anij.
Mr. Ayman, there is, praise be to God, cooperation between the family, the guardians, the center, and also the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Because everything that comes to us, whether it's an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, each month has a rating.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four-person session, there is a report.
The guide through a password and username,
We gave it to him, what can he access?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he joined the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a girl.
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later.
We will see different models, I wish we had enough space.
But we brought a model of a girl.
You will face a different test ahead of you on air.
We will ask her math questions and a variety of questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back with you to watch this smart girl, stay tuned.
Artistic performance, the audience has become very sophisticated now.
If he's captured by a drama from the first, second, or third episode, and if he feels he's not interested in the drama, he'll use the remote.
He won't care, he has twenty thousand other chains.
Correct, the Twenty Thousand series, that's right.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't do that, they focus on one work.
He can see other works.
Likewise, this is the majority.
He claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Certainly, we welcome you among us, our dear and generous guest, Abdel Hamid Cherchani.
Do you want to say something to the audience, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, "May you find you in good health every year."
It's true that we don't go out much, don't show up much, don't work much, and the reason, the reason I've already mentioned.
What's coming will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best in your endeavors this year.
Insha'Allah, we will talk to you in another meeting to discuss those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are awaited by fans of new trends.
Hello to our dear followers via Doha Morning, and we are with you live.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who joined this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other potentials.
And also to make their minds work fully.
Mrs. Naseema and Mr. Ayman Khalji, Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
You are welcome with us.
And with us is the beautiful Amanya, good morning Amanya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Whatever God wills, we wish you all the best.
What things are presented to our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and was specifically directed towards the benefit of our children.
The program is Mental Math Minds.
Finger counting and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to present a small part of it.
I felt, Mr. Ibrahim, that there was indeed a difference in the student on his first two days.
And after maybe three or four months?
Whether it is taught in public, private, or even independent schools.
In fact, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
showing the missing potential or the need for further development
Has he reached a certain level or what updates have occurred to the child?
Therefore, we work on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine way.
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amniyah is a student who joined this center.
We want to do this right away today, so we can show you viewers the importance of this.
If you bring the bisht, I won't object.
So this is a very fast and small part of the Tisanf series, and you will watch the second part.
But as we've seen, this part of the Tissanf series is the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the "Tsanif" series, where each episode has a different theme?
This year, focus on making it count.
Inattentive virtuous
Which encourages by giving opportunities
Sixteen episodes in Tessanf 2.
He will be a guest on a show, an episode where he will be an old man and an episode where he will be a baker.
Therefore, it's a set of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
I can't remember many actors now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohamed Adel.
Tara, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't appear.
We now have a few jobs in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that too?
Qatar Television provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV did its best, but with only one production a year, all Qatari actors want to work.
That was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
If someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Thank you, God, for everything.
Let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasem is among the rulings of humans, even after the dispersion until yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
For he is the one who adopted us, taught us, and made us.
Then, Mr. Ghaniem in his autobiography, did his best, in Visa Tosh 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two works a year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, Tara.
The deadly feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
Monir %PW is the director of the series.
We are back, dear viewers, and today we will talk about reflexology.
The message is in the hand, the palm of the hand.
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The way the inspection is done is as follows.
Swelling, degree of pain.
You can feel inside the hand that there is something like sand or ruptured veins inside the hand.
Loosen your grip.
The brother is nervous.
You feel a bit stressed and tense, stressed.
The left side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they won't know what we're doing.
Any health problem would be evident, we now know about the headaches and dizziness that comes with it.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means problem.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's shivering. Do you have a sinus problem or any problem at all?
I had surgery, but that was a long time ago.
Is it a tumor or something?
He gains weight without eating.
Good, your left shoulder.
Because it's about nerves, when I told him he had nervous tension.
Ten years ago, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think they empty out.
Any uneven ground is not just the sea.
The negative energy that may %PW.
He might be amazed at you for discovering these things through massage.
Of course, children are the most important.
Children, praise be to God. This is for the mother, pay attention to me!
What hurts him is the milk and the food he eats.
Her son is parallel to her, she'll put him and it will close automatically.
Lower your hand.
A little pressure, thank God.
She'll discover in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, he'll be in pain due to the hurt here.
Then you will notice that the gases suddenly escape.
What are the discoveries you've made, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bone, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing for menstrual pains or period pain in general.
She needs to focus on a rock or stone, by pressing here, you are giving orders to God to perpetuate glory to the lower back and period problems. If you have pain,
It will disappear in seconds, God willing.
Pregnant woman
The delivery process became easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they told her that there was a possibility of giving birth at seven or you can give birth at nine.
Except on the sands.
If you walk on sand, no problem, but if you walk on rocks, no.
She should eat seven soft dates for breakfast, soft dates are better.
If she doesn't have soft dates, regular dates will do.
As Allah the Almighty says, I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, indeed my discovery is from the Quran.
This means that God could not allow these soft dates to come to her, no, He was not incapable.
O Allah, I thank You and ask You to relieve me of what I am suffering from.
She has to bring a rock or small balls.
Birthing bed. For example, if you forget and come to the birthing bed, she grabs the handles.
You will notice in private hospitals a lady from East Asia coming.
It is a practice in East Asia.
No need, you already have my mobile phone.
Only the mobile!
To cooperate with each other, I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Make charity a habit and also take care of others. You were created to worship God and then to serve others.
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I thank Mr. Abdulaziz for this wonderful interview, and I also thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the General Department of Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak more about this.
Good morning, Sheikh.
We start by looking at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
A program as part of the national strategy to treat, combat obesity.
Four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are Gulf states.
We started a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and the other authority to combat obesity.
Out of fear of its spreading further and further soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can do this competition together, so it will be an international competition.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness of the importance of health at this age for students in grades seven and eight.
Because this is the first stage where they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about what is your favorite fruit?
The second week is walking.
To get points, you have to walk! Every time you walk, you get points.
This is a map of Qatar, and every time someone gets points, they go and move their school forward and their class moves forward.
A beautiful competition was created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink a lot of soda every time you feel thirsty, don't drink water!
After that, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that not everyone likes.
We are looking for a sport that he loves.
Let's force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that they should allow their child to have a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take.
Of course, this is a model, and if God wills, we will expand the experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had so much fun with our peers.
The girls say that their skin has improved and acne has decreased.
This is true, this is true and becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And their classmates from different grades, asking them "How are you?" and learning from their peers.
Praise be to God, the word is spreading that many schools are eager to participate next year.
Inshallah.
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had an Aspire Zone that provided sports competitions and awareness.
On the table.
God blesses them with many authorities, some of which I mentioned and some I didn't.
But thank God everyone shared a part.
And the other, the brothers were doing it in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
It's the next generation.
To spread this experience as much as possible in Qatar.
When you evaluate, there's something you need to fix.
After its widespread use and satisfactory results,
Insha'Allah, we will spread because there are people asking us why we are not present.
Eat, eat healthy food and you will get there, you have no problem.
When we are at this age, when it starts from an early age, it will reach what it wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five
Happiness, you mentioned a series of titles, each group has a title.
If we return, we will try in our segment today to talk about the conclusion of events.
And if we remember people again, in our program, we had more than one host.
Let's repeat and reiterate what is the information for each week that we want to present to the student.
Certainly, first of all, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every page was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits containing vitamin C?
So he began to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking. People think that walking is only for the elderly. Why should young people walk?
So I grew up and left.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your mind and brain.
That relieves the individual, which means that walking improves mental clarity.
I took the students on excursions.
Yes, they all had to walk, whether at home or at school.
They record their points through the class teacher.
They used to walk there daily.
That was an occasion, there were people who marched, the girls' school marched.
I want them to love this, being creative with unique ideas.
The competitive spirit and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want them to give them ideas they should stick to.
Everyone has a skill in this subject.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We always try to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and crave soda patch patch
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could find out his favorite sport and support him in it.
He will take care of sports.
He loves sports by practicing them, he plays sports unconsciously.
We mentioned earlier that we would talk about the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our daily guest who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this exhibition.
And part of them are these diseases that few of us have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
Chronic illness
It affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the cause of suffering from this disease is unknown.
It affects the active group in society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm or other illnesses.
This disease is an infection of the brain and spinal cord.
The central nervous system in the human body.
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
The white cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
leading to lack of nerve signal access, or weakness, or disturbance.
Leads to paralysis, God protect you.
No, with the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Certainly, besides the solution, we want to know how to obtain it.
Also, one should have protection from these things.
The main reason for that, is it the quality of life, the nature of food, or the cycle of life?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All of these topics may be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we know its causes.
Good, the age group that might be affected by this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years, the disease begins to calm down with the person.
So far, we have not been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have 25,000 cases.
And also Qatar.
Just last week, they told me about three to four cases that were diagnosed.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, and this is recorded in the files.
And many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatment in other countries.
Welcome, Mr. Abdulaziz. Are there any side effects, like someone being affected by this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they are suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
We must be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
When giving a specific reason related to a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
