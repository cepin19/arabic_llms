environmental family of Jesus
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham is the father of Isaac. Isaac is the father of Jacob. Jacob is the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah is the father of Perez and Zerah. Tamar is their mother. Perez is the father of Hezron. Hezron is the father of Ram.
Ram is the father of Aminadab. Aminadab is the father of Nahshon. Nahshon is the father of Salmon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse fathered David the king. And David fathered Solomon, whose mother was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah.
Solomon is the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam is the father of Abijah. Abijah is the father of Asa.
Isaiah is the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat is the father of Jehoram. Jehoram is the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah is the father of Jotham. Jotham is the father of Ahaz. Ahaz is the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And he is the father of Yonah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon.
And afterward, the family line continued. Joachim was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zephaniah was the father of Jecoliah, Jecoliah was the father of Ahasiah, and Ahasiah was the father of Azariah.
I used to visit the father of Zedekiah. Zedekiah was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Eliud.
Elieud is the father of Eliezer. Eliezer is the father of Matan. Matan is the father of Yaakov.
Jacob is the father of Joseph. Joseph is the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah. And this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about:
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a good man. He didn't want to bring her shame in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She wants to give birth to a son. She must name him Jesus. This is because he will make his people repent of their sins.
All this was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet.
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph awoke. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary to his house as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she had borne a son, and he called his name Jesus.
The apostles visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel. His origin is from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
After the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is searching for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph arose. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, fulfilling the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the Magi had deceived him. He became furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the Magi had seen the star.
In this way the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, who said:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Jacob arose and took his children and his wives, and his nurses and all his belongings, and set out on a journey to the land of Canaan.
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Depart from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
John is the person of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight his paths.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.
The sickle is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be uprooted. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to turn away from your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his field. He will gather the wheat into the barn. But he will burn the straw with a fire that cannot be quenched." The Baptism of Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is right that we should do this to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Isa is being tested.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)"
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate yourself before me and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus was fulfilled what the prophet Jesus had said: "He who has seen me has seen the Father."
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but the light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus returned to all the Galilees. There was teaching in the synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and infirmity among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the humble, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
May God bless you when people mock you and hurt you because of me. You are also blessed when they say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harmed the prophets who lived before your time. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But what if the salt loses its saltiness? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people.
"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden."
Likewise, people do not set a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. Instead, they set it on a stand. Then the lamp lights up for everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them."
What I will tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the Law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen from the Law will disappear until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the smallest commandment, and do not teach others to break it. If you do, you will be least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, obey these commandments and teach them. Then you will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
"This is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder"
I heard what was told to the people who lived long ago. They were told, "Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Anyone who kills will be brought to justice for it."
And this is what I say to you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother 'Raka' will be liable to the council, but whoever says 'You fool!' will be liable to hellfire.
Suppose you are presenting your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. Go first and make peace with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.
Assume someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do that while you're still on your way with him. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you might be thrown into jail.
What I'm telling you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Adultery
"I have heard it said, 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)"
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is only a part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is but a part of your body. It is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell."
It is written, "When a man puts away his wife, he shall give her a bill of divorcement." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
And here is what I say to you. Whoever divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man cannot divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him. I swear to God.
Once again, I have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, "Do not break the promises you made to the Lord. Keep the oath you made to him."
But this is what I tell you. Never make any such promises at all. Don't make them for the sake of heaven. This is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of the earth. That throne is for the feet of God. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not take an oath by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
"Let 'yes' be 'yes,' and 'no' be 'no.' Anything more than this comes from the evil one. Be kind to others."
I have heard it said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
Suppose someone takes you to court to get your shirt. Let him take your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Go two miles with him.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn away from those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
I heard them say, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But this is what I say to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet those from your own tribe, what more are you doing than others? Even unbelievers do that.
So be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to people in need.
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in the temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am telling you is true. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then a secret will be given to you. Your father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
You're not like them. My father knows what you need before you even ask him.
"This is how you should pray. " "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Your kingdom come. Let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
"Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Free us from the devil."
Forgive people if they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. - Fasting
"When you go without eating, you don't look as sad as those who only pretend to be holy. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They have received their full reward."
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not acquire riches for yourselves in the land. For the moth and rust consume them, and thieves break in and steal them.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a candle for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
He told me, "Do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not things more important for the body than clothes?"
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why are you worried about clothes? Look how wildflowers grow. They don't work and make clothes."
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
"If God clothes the grass of the field, will He not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!"
So don't worry. Don't say, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
People who don't care about religion pursue all those things. My Father in heaven knows you need them.
"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore, do what God wants you to do, and all these things will be given to you as well."
So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standards by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measures by which you measure others.
"You see a speck of sawdust in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own."
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get that splinter out of your eye"? How can you say this when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or if he asked for a fish, would you give him a snake?
If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and the small gates.
Enter the kingdom of God by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell. Many go in this way.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name do many mighty works?' But I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you who do lawlessness!" Wise and foolish builders.
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The water is rising. The wind is blowing and beating against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. It collapses with a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Teach like one who has authority. Don't speak like their law teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus and bowed down before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer with faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
He said, "O Lord, Your servant is sick in his house and cannot move, and he is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have yet to find anyone in Israel with such great faith.
He said to you, "Many will come from east and west, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
But those who believe they belong to the kingdom will be thrown out, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He bore our sufferings and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) Following the cost of Jesus.
Jesus saw the crowd around him. He asked his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves overwhelmed the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students went and woke him up. They said, "Oh Lord! Save us! We are drowning!"
He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus crossed to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes. Two men who were possessed by demons met him. They came out from the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Sons of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before the time of judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and reported all these things. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say "Rise and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
And as Jesus passed by from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose and followed Him.
Afterward Jesus went to the home of a man named Matthew and many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with him and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day, the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus said, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't put a new patch on old clothes. The new patch will tear away from the old. This will make the hole worse.
"People do not pour new wine into old bottles. If they do, the bottles will burst. The wine will be spilled, and the bottles will be ruined. No, everyone pours new wine into new bottles. Then both are saved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, "Your daughter is dead. Don't bother the teacher anymore." But Jesus ignored what was said and told the synagogue leader, "Don't be afraid; just believe." He took the woman by the hand and said to her, "My child, get up!"
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
She said to herself: "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the multitude had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she stood up.
The news of what Jesus had done spread throughout the region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your belief will guide you.
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowds were amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And healed every sickness and disease.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
"Therefore ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus came and called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out, and over every disease and sickness to heal them.
These are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The other two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go to the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a suitcase for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker must be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When entering the house, greet those who live there.
If that house welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Danger! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, you'll be given the right words to say.
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
"Brothers will turn each other in to be killed. Fathers will turn in their sons. Sons will rise up against their fathers and kill them."
All people will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"If people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is the truth. You will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not preferred over his teacher. A slave is not preferred over his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can those who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything secret will be revealed. Everything hidden will be made known.
What I'm telling you in the dark, say it in the daylight. What's whispered in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
"Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
"What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him."
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and wives against their mothers-in-law.
A man's enemies are the men of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. If anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. They will receive the reward of a prophet. And suppose someone welcomes a holy figure as a holy figure. They will receive the reward of a holy figure.
"Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my little followers. I tell you the truth, that person will certainly be rewarded."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he continued teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is preached to the poor.
"Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me."
While the disciples of Jacob and John were leaving, Jesus began to speak to Jacob in the presence of the crowd. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? Grass that is shaken by the wind?"
If that weren't the case, what would you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He who was mentioned in the Holy Bible. It says, "I will send my messenger before you. He will prepare your way for you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive it, John is Elijah who was to come.
"Let those who have ears hear."
"What can I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to each other. They say,
"We played the flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song. But you didn't become sad."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. People say, "He has a devil."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you. And people say, "This man eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right. Cities that do not turn from sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
"But you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will descend to hell. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
"But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Comfort for those who feel weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. That's what I wanted.
"My father gave me everything. A father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to make him known."
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
Send forth My servants and learn from Me. I am Merciful and withdrawn from arrogance. You will find rest for your souls.
"It's an easy task for me, and my burden is light."
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It tells us how the priests in the temple are to do their work every Sabbath day. But they are not guilty.
I tell you, something more important than the temple is here.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse those who are innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
From there, Jesus went to their synagogue.
A man with a withered and paralyzed hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus, so they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! Therefore the laws allow us to do good on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. He left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed them of every disease.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. He says:
"Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright."
He will not quarrel or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
A bent twig will not break. A flickering flame will not be extinguished. It will correct everything.
"The peoples will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see things.
All the people were amazed. They said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil casts out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? They will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what the man owns? You must first bind him. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
"A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"Your nests are full of venomous snakes! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak whatever is in your hearts."
A good man speaks good things. These come from the good that is put within him. An evil man speaks evil things. These come from the evil that is put within him.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified or condemned." The sign of Jonah, the miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He said, "Evil and disbelieving people seek a wondrous sign! But no one will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
"The men of Nineveh will stand in the judgment day with the people who are now living. And the Ninevites will win that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when Jonah preached to them. Now, there is one greater than Jonah."
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry places, seeking a resting place. But it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." And when he gets there, he finds the house empty. He has managed to clean the house and put it in good condition.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with him seven other evil spirits more wicked than himself. They go in and live there, and the man becomes worse than before. So will it be with this evil generation." Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus, pointing to his disciples, said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
Everyone who does what my Father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he said to them many things by using parables. He said: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, the plants were scorched. They withered because they had no roots.
The last seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They bore fruit, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"Those who have ears, let them hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
"I have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. That has not been given to outsiders."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will get more. In fact, they will get a lot. If no one has this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand.
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus, who said, "You will hear but not understand. You will see but not comprehend."
"Their hearts have become callous. They barely hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is true. Many prophets and holy men wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and accept it with joy immediately.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they do not last long. They quickly abandon the faith when trouble or suffering arises because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke the word, preventing it from bearing fruit.
But others fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's slaves came to him. They said, "Master, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did this," he replied. The servants asked, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
" 'No,' the owner replied. 'When you pull the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them.'"
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them: "First gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." - Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of all your plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
He came.
So the words that the prophet spoke came true. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories; I will speak about things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the grasses.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed."
The field is the world. The good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are the angels.
"The weeds are being uprooted and burned in the fire. So it will be on the day of judgment."
The Son of Man will send His angels. They will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will cast them into the burning coal. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears, let them hear. Stories of hidden treasure and pearls.
"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of rare pearls.
He found one very old. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together every kind of fish."
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish back into the sea.
Thus it will be on the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus said, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get the power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
Because they were not believers, few miracles were done there.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He had bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. He was very pleased.
He promised her by his right hand that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought of his promise and his hospitality. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod had John's head cut off in prison.
His head was served on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring them to me here."
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate also. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the multitude away.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was far from the shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said, and wept in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are You?" Peter asked. "If You are, tell me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said, "Come," and Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
When they asked him to allow the sick to touch the edge of his clothes, he begged them to do so. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and some scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "And why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus رجال رجال رجال رجال رجال رجال
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents by giving them gifts. You make God's word of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
"You are hidden! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
"These people annoy me with their chatter. And their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus came to the crowd and said, "Hear and understand."
What goes into your mouth doesn't make it 'dirty'. It's what comes out of your mouth that makes it 'dirty'.
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus replied, "There are plants that my Father did not plant; they will be uprooted."
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, they will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you still not understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely afflicted by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him, entreating him, "Send her away; for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
Reply: "It is not right for you to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, my Lord." "But dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain side and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." "Where shall we get enough bread to feed so large a crowd?" they asked.
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Then the disciples picked up seven baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
The people ask Jesus for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
Reply: "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say, "Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! And no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed over to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students discussed this matter among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is small! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Why don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to be careful about the yeast used in bread. He was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They replied: "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"Why you?" he said. "Who do you think I am?"
Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
Thus I tell you: You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What good is it to gain the whole world if one loses their soul? Or what can anyone exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each according to his works.
What I say to you is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The body of Jesus is changing.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were afraid. They fell on their faces.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Arise," he said. "Do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. As they were coming down, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "True. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again."
"And I say to you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. So also will they do to the Son of Man."
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him.
He said, "Oh Lord, have mercy on my son. He shivers greatly and suffers much. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You are the people who are unbelieving and evil!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' andFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFutFu

They met in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise again." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
When Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said to him, "Does your teacher pay the temple tax?"
He said, "Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect роз роз роз роз роз роз роз роз
"From the others," Peter answered. "So the children will not have to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the small coin you need. Take it and give it to them bağ bağ bağ bağ bağ bağ bağ
