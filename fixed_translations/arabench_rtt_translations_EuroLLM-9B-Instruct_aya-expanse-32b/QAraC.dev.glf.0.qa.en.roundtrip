And you're hungry.
Will you eat or not?
No, I will eat.
He told me, "Have you done that before?"
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I was bored with him.
This is our chance, our cars are shamefully old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Stupid! Lacks self-confidence.
Haha, scared?
What really bothers me
Is he responsible for the budget?
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
That means I will write.
I consider myself a participant!
It's not fair that I get nothing in return.
Won't I get anything?
That means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your foolish son won't understand.
I will talk to him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like others do.
The happy feast is before you.
Take your share.
He won't have a single Qatari riyal in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
The government's projects are known to...
And the last third is plunder.
Salome's son
He went to Souq Waqif.
One of the lanterns cost him eighteen riyals.
They priced it in the budget.
180 riyals each.
They said they hadn't done anything wrong.
You will be full of this person.
"And hold fast to the rope of Allah together, and do not..."
Yes, but I think he changes his mind.
God willing, my God.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
In importance, don't forget us.
We are your friends.
Together we must be.
A government project like this is an opportunity.
Yes, Ali!
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
And hopefully, everyone will be included in the project.
Certainly
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
We won't worry because you are members of the project committee.
Are they worried about Saleh, the project manager?
They say that
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your friends not to worry.
Is my father Fahd? Oh, really!
The news is good.
But, Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Good luck, everything is fine.
Let Saleh agree first.
I'll take care of him.
I was wondering if I'd get some perks.
Is it possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But most importantly, it should remain a secret between us.
I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Certainly I will.
Good appetite.
What's wrong with you!
If you stay absent-minded like this,
That won't work.
This won't work.
Or questions
We're happy to help.
How will we get our share?
Or is this logical?
What shall we name her!
We're also not the only ones who will take.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We're the ones who will set the budget.
What about the land he bought today?
Did he find it like that?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
He told me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's the matter?"
Tell your brother.
The others' land
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
It has been approved for sale.
He told me to call him to confirm his interest, I'll book it for him.
He doesn't want to share money with us.
What about our money?
We are considered accomplices.
And if we weren't participating!
You used to eat a big mouthful by yourself.
At least give your brother and mother some.
I'm not here to beg you.
We are participants in the project as well, we have the right to ask for our share.
Say it to her, say it to her.
It's true that when the sultan came and asked him about his share, he refused it.
But I didn't agree with him.
You have to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
I am no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking to them.
They allow their brothers and friends to enter.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't want a limited amount of money, that's all.
Subscribed capital
That his brother Sultan could attend committee meetings if he wished.
because it seems that the committee members
Budget project
But we want to
Thank you.
Yes, Abu Saleh.
Your wife's brother!
You will love him.
The project will benefit.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, didn't we?
O Saleh
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Hello, people!
Take your share.
I swear, I swear.
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And I might say sometimes
Let me take a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want using your preferred method.
The most important thing,
We too,
Therefore, during this week,
Everyone determines the amount they want to receive.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
I'm asking for more than one hundred thousand.
Yes, but why is that, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on the looting, ignore him.
There are also the funds of the orphans.
Or increase the budget.
Many people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! Is this your father's project!
Yes, he is the sultan.
Oh! My brother Oh! Sultan
It means he is a participant.
Is that the last name?
Your friend Saud adds a lot of names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's take advantage of them."
So in which group do I add it, percentage or amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
How much should you allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, that's enough.
They even add a note here saying
I am our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of that will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one will notice.
Yes, there's also the list that my mom sent.
Every two hours, you call and add people without asking.
Haha, I wish she lived longer.
Eye of my eye, my son.
"O Allah, bless you, she is sick and poor."
But the woman has no money.
God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant surgery.
Wait! Yes, wait... How much do you need?
How much is enough for the liver, housing, and the hospital!
Around 180,000 riyals.
How many livers will you transplant!
One, but my sister is expensive.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her from your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I'm not taking anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighteen thousand riyals.
Oh man, they're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy a gift for my daughters.
2000
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mother.
I have a lot of work.
After that, I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the feast increased.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Do not forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
How long are you satisfied?
I am the chairman of the board.
And I tell you, you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will give us payments continuously.
How much! We want to know!
They will give it to us all at once or in installments.
Why do you take more than us?
There's an electric shock or there's looting, it doesn't matter, the most important thing is to stay quiet, we're waiting for them and they're coming.
He told you to stop talking, so stop talking.
You won't feel embarrassed.
If you hear someone speaking
I will sew his mouth shut.
You stayed with us for a very long time.
You know this is money, it's not a simple matter.
How long ago was it?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss after all.
What we want is to get rid of the headache.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a spiritual and very important project.
And it is not just for these generations.
Yes yes
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
And I welcome.
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
I am bored.
You won't see the speakers talking and the audience clapping their hands for them.
We are at the official opening, what's wrong with you?
أوكي، الحين تكلموا، هذا يعني إنا في المشروع.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people try their best.
And these divisions, I don't know what they put inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
Official opening of international beaches %pw
3rd millennium, what's the matter with you.
I truly don't know.
Yes, thank God, old age is a disease.
I want to know why they fired me.
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me that...
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
God have mercy on you, you are at peace.
Receive checks while relaxing at home.
Why do you care, dear? Don't let anyone bother you, Manira.
"Oh God, thank your Lord, Munira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Sakir."
Worry about your share and invest it.
Look at my friend Hessa.
Her brother doesn't give her a single riyal from their father's inheritance.
We don't act this way.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't you trust us!
I don't know.
I'm not happy with what my brother Rashid said.
He keeps reminding me of the check they give me every three months.
But, this is my right.
He always told me:
We won't trust you.
Money and inheritance matters should be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
You know what he does to people.
And the mother of the believers is an example for you, the poor lady.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But work is work, and it's your legal right.
And then what?
And we manage the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems or headaches.
She said she was passing through the earth, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
Fearing that her husband, Nasir, was behind it.
What's the problem?
Your sister started searching.
This is the problem.
She's planning to get us into trouble.
This is a way of giving her money.
Dwell in Sahr.
We must find a solution to this problem, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance.
The charity they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they aren't investing the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Concept.
They said, "Let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking."
Likewise, everything you said is true.
They give me a little each time.
If only you could see their wives.
Contains many different types of diamond jewelry.
I do not have half of what they have.
They won't feel that I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
It's your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing from me and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with the way they're behaving.
Life is unpredictable, dear!
They've drained me, made me sick, my love!
They do not know that there is a judgment and a punishment.
And that God will punish them for taking other people's money.
And be careful, don't remind them of anything about the court, dear.
They will be happy.
Is it because of our population density?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear.
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a skyscraper.
I just want my right.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And giving charity to the poor.
Mother of Salma
Lower your voice, dear.
And don't remind them of anything about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are being taken away.
You were talking to the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask questions
Answer them!
Yes, I am... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't smile.
Do you know which door I entered through?
No, no
No hawks
Sorry, Saad
Manon, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and property, that's fine.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure she's his evil wife.
She's also nice.
As if I'm begging them.
It's a well-known, definite, and legal law.
He told me it was either six hundred thousand or nothing.
It's not fair.
Expect anything, Munira!
My father's company.
8 buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
And he says only six hundred thousand.
With the signing of the waiver document
No, oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign this paper, be careful, I'm warning you.
You have the right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else, not in their hands.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You've been fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
What science?
Is this your father's company?
Don't you see him screaming?
Let me in, I told you.
Leave it, no need.
He has a paper that I don't know what it is.
He's shouting in our faces, let him calm down.
Sorry.
My brother Saad went to the office and told them, as they didn't know.
Come inside.
Ask Mr. Nasser if he wants to drink something.
Please enter.
Certainly %pw
You'll get us into trouble.
He will discover how much she has.
He will discover that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do math.
In ninety-six months,
Here's the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
11,520,000
So what, what does that mean?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
It's our money.
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, welcome to your company, don't worry about what happened.
Welcome
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser may have.
The entire company is under your control.
If you want to enter, go ahead, you don't need to ask for permission for anything.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go to him, take him.
Look at all the files.
She is supposed to take more than ten million.
They haven't even mentioned that yet.
Poor thing, she used to say.
Her father left her.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
"God suffices us against all things, and He is the Preserver. O my son!"
It's not fair what they're doing.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, O Mother of Salma?
I have to sue them, there's no other choice.
He will quickly pass some papers.
The judge decides to adjourn the case.
Beware, beware, my son, Nasser.
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh! Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O Umm Sulaym!
Go to your room.
All the Muslim patients
He didn't tell me that.
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, now I remember you, yes, yes, I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
About what, brother!
Undoubtedly, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
Do you think Abdullah, whom you sent to them, can...
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, since years ago.
Do you believe Monira?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
It's not for people who live seventy or eighty years.
It is for those who will live for at least two hundred years.
Mother of Muslims, may God have mercy on her.
"O God, have mercy on her soul," she used to say.
Our population has not reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do they have to consult us before going to court?
That is he.
Yes, dear, are you sitting with them?
Goodbye.
By the way, he's an old friend from school.
Life is short.
And I seek your benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And it has deep roots.
Please, Rashid, we are friends.
Please go while I'm still calm.
Or you will be beaten.
Go, forget about friendship.
Will you go out or what?
Paid thousands for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibit.
Where did you get all this money?
They squander money on their wives.
And impoverishing her sisters of her wealth.
Do you still have hope, Nasser!
They fought with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Let me do what I told you.
A well-known people with deep roots
Perhaps, why not?
But, I also suggest
O Allah, bless this conversation with these bright faces.
O Allah, illuminate our hearts with that which is good for our life in this world and the hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say, don't bring up my sister's problem.
It's true.
"Better go, or he'll hit you."
I don't mind what you're saying.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
It doesn't bother me.
I will go tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Do not listen to her.
You won't go to court.
The day after tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to find out what you'll do.
Goodbye
Kindness doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was at risk.
We'll see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we can go there tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did that.
Your life will be beautiful.
Your life might be perfect.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
Upon arrival, first park your car in the parking lot.
You will see the security guards.
You go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Are there business cards for all the lawyers in the country?
I'm sure you'll need it.
Let's come here to mock ourselves.
They want her to initiate legal proceedings against us.
Going to court
Listen to *Manon*.
He signed the waiver document for us.
"Which are go
Know the way.
We showed you the way.
Go, my brother.
I forgot to give Munira something important.
This is the daily Al Raya news newspaper.
There is a good article like this.
A woman wrote that, I assume she's a doctor.
I want you to look, as a gift *from me*
His living conditions must be changed.
It's a pity.
He has four children, but his home is miserable.
Certainly he will, for he has risked all his fortune.
He took a risk on this project.
The one I never expected to start a business is Bou and Waleed.
Eat, eat, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid.
My dear, do you want me to feed you something?
No, I'm fine.
Wake up and move, get some fruit.
Mom, I want a Hamed toy.
Bon appétit.
My son Waleed, put some candy out for your brother.
Our greetings on the project, Abu Walid; you deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Dad, when we become a big merchant, I want to have a room of my own.
See who asked about him, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll get you a large BlackBerry.
Forget their desires now.
Like all people
Replace our small, miserable house.
First, let's pay off all our debts, then we'll see.
Bawail, you look very happy.
He ate more than before.
He is a merchant, he is lucky.
All the hair is my father's, the merchant's.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese young man, I was among them.
When we were seated, I switched my seat with his, and he presented me with a catalog as a gift.
After that, one of my friends saw that.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
It's always like this.
They are computer labs.
Press the cinema.
If you want a playground..
This is magic.
They were dazzled, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, some from my relatives, and sold my land, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has agreed,
Why didn't you request it since the ministry approved it?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting in Ali's office.
And the manager didn't call, my brother.
And be away for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Don't you have full authority as a manager?
Why don't you go to him to sign for you?
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
A person's appearance can be deceiving at times.
O Lord, grant us gratitude for Your blessings.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Are you finished?
How will I be able to finish that when Bou Fahd never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible to get it over with, I don't know what to do.
For fear the manager might ask about you.
Tell him I am sick, what's wrong?
I myself am waiting.
You say that while you were his secretary, what about us?
And give me your mobile phone number.
Not the secretary, please sit down, sit down, it's not him, what's wrong?
Don't call, you scare people, they think you're the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, My philosophy in toilet repair
He is stupid.
Hello people, wait, wait
Often, often.
He told you to shut up, enough, be quiet.
Bu Fahad had to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
We'll see it in the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
O God, grant us help.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, dear.
But he behaves strangely.
And if he does not receive the goods.
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs it.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
Here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
It's beyond my control, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but that's not fair.
The class will start next week at the university.
If I hadn't registered, I would have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
Oh! My darling, I'm trying.
Don't you see that I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Bou Fahd comes, Bou Fahd.
And I will stand in the house.
Why don't you understand!
Don't burden me at lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
You are stupid.
I know you need the money.
But, hopefully, Boo Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they will give him the down payment.
I don't know what to say to you, sister.
Woke up in a panic.
He walks in his sleep and talks to himself all night.
If Bu Fahd hadn't signed.
O God, grant it to me.
Therefore,
This cheetah needs to sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And he traveled for a year.
Neglecting people's well-being
Oh oh oh oh oh how is that
Do you feel better now?
You shattered me.
This unusual fever is dragging me, dragging me.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
To complete my papers
He told the staff that he would punish me.
The time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
She is Bu Fahad's secretary.
I want to tell you that
Certainly, he will come tomorrow.
As soon as I call you,
You come directly.
Good, bless you.
You weren't this kind of person before.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your mobile screen.
I said it's a shame.
So you won't feel responsible.
Even if I'm committed to that.
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing.
He is miserable.
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
I heard about the factory.
He will lose his money if he doesn't sign his papers today.
If he went and the manager knew about it.
Damn, yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of it, just let it go.
Bu Waleed
I'll go, but I'm expecting a phone call.
Tell me
O God, grant it to me.
Wait, people, wait.
How can I know where he is going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
We'll go look for him in Uzbekistan.

I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
But there's not much time, Abu Saeed.
What were you thinking?
Perhaps about fourteen years.
As a messenger
Such a headache.
Sweating without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike was ever easy?
With a yellow mark
It was a very difficult time, oh! Bu Saeed.
Misery, my son!
But what can we do, O son of man?
Bu Saad
I'm sorry, guys, the boss arrived as he said. Let's get back to work.
The manager has arrived, my dear. Let's go.
Your happiness is my happiness, Abu Saeed.
They said your son, Khalid, was working.
I told you so.
I told you, God willing.

I told you when my last son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Please, God, I'll finish my work.
Served properly
O Allah, show us the
Change your mind, Abu Saeed!
And you deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz!
I'm truly grateful, Abu Abdulaziz.
Peace be upon you.
We have done our duty.
Let them write the journey.
It's your right.
After all these years and work
Means all that is exchanged between them back and forth.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
Celebrating my retirement
A cup of coffee and some dates, how wonderful.
When will we finish, my son?
You are in a hurry because of the khanafروش, oh! Bu Saeed
Don't worry.
Khanafروش is ready
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the khanfaroush is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
Your chance to introduce him is today.
He told me that their manager would come.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't even want to move.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye.
You congratulate me.
No more work.
It means you're free, Father.
Okay, please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.

He asked me to cook some canfaroush.
I returned it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
I've made this old man tired.
As soon as he returns,
He was tired.
Don't bother me about them (singing)
Don't bother me about them (singing)
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
And he said that he would punish anyone who was late.
Certainly, my dear.
Go to your work.
About this nose, and those little Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bou Saada
He sends you to a place every day.
As You Like It, Mother of Saeed
It smells.
In my nose
Khanafروش Khanafars
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, Father, take it to the market branch.
And he went there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and they're telling me he's not here.
Okay, thank you, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
The sun hit.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what was wrong.
What makes you do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat kunafah now.
Mom, where's Dad?
I'm going back and forth.
She didn't tell him which bank to go to.
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the principal.
How is my father now, does he feel better?
I slept a little, and the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave his father alone, let him rest.
Are they miserable, or happy?
They must adhere to their tasks, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
As you wish
This is not
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
Why
Before, in the past
Narrowness is defined for me.
Your children are adults.
I have to help them.
They used to tell me
You are wrong.
Do you think all young people without a father don't finish their personal work?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to leave to finish your personal work.
O Allah, grant you goodness.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin?
I will finish some paperwork, for my son, Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this cafe.
I will bring him to the Land Departments.
Goodbye
What's wrong, Mama? Okay, I'll see you later, goodbye.
This won't help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent.
And he doesn't talk about it.
"You've tired him out, fear God."
It was your very loud screaming that woke me up.
Dad, I was a government employee and you know well what hoarding means.
They are writing this first.
And now they are %pw, doing like this.
Tomorrow is the last day to get loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Okay, son.
You believe their lies.
He said he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as usual.
Go immediately to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He has been silent since he returned home.
He doesn't answer me.
You have no shame at all.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree with this.
Indeed, and may God reward you with good.
He was supposed to call you.
Why does he want to call his servant?
You are the most respected among us, Father!
I was grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me preach to him.
And from now on, Father.
And rest.
Khanfarosh Khanfarosh (Singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, father.
O Allah, grant us Paradise.
We have decided that from now on,
We will do our paperwork ourselves.
Thank you all, may God reward you, praise be to God.
But, Father!
Consider it the last.
But I can't.
They told me now.
Father, I won't go to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, this is impossible, you can't disturb the minister, you must go, even before him.
I won't go any further, what can I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, and it's done.
He'll be on his way once you finish Saeed's papers.
By the class, father.
Consider it the last leaf you finish for me.
I'm happy to serve you, Father!
But your son needs to sign this paper.
Do you mean I should come back and give it to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
And if they don't see the papers
You will have to wait for two months.
Don't give it to him until he signs it and I get back to you.
No, no, no, no need.
Call him and ask him to come, just for two minutes.
I'll finish it.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
Return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Whenever I asked a friend, "Where are you?"
He says he's with Saeed.
I'm waiting for the end of the work day.
ok, man
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your sons?
Don't you have any children?
Are you okay, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I will leave you.
And he moved to the nursing home for the elderly.
What I want to tell them is where I'm going.
What will you tell them, Bou Said?
I will write something else.
Yes, thank God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
She's not really my sister.
Why do you care?
I told him never to appear on television or radio.
These "Stop Corruption" conversations got us into trouble.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
Hello, my sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was away.
What can I tell you?
The program called Miles, I think.
Speak with the man.
Called Khalid Jassem
And tell him to stop corrupting.
His colleagues at work heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do that,
He left it.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
I'm sorry now because I have to go cook.
Hello anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and fed up with this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I'm sorry I found out this happened.
I didn't tell you about this.
What are they, Mother?
And he screamed.
This commitment
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
We don't have to talk about this.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
It's despicable, after all these years, to evict me.
You don't listen.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
It's a weapon.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well-informed
We just cancelled a number.
And you are among them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
A good brother
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, hasn't found out.
He's already angry with you.
Who will know him?
If he asks you about those matters.
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he was still working.
Of course
His mother says it's today.
What can we do with him now?
We can't let our daughters suffer with him.
Whatever you see now.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to get my daughter released.
Drink your coffee.
You won't remain a wanderer unless you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are fired.
I know you want to know.
Go to the café.
Lest you talk about nothing.
Go to your room and lie down.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Mom, I told you, I broke this habit.
I swear
Mom, to be honest, I'm a little bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
As if you were deaf.
It has changed.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you talking like you used to?
We want to hear some of your talk about stopping corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Healthy here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the café.
What did he say?
He did the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around her.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll make you regret it.
If it's not your fault,
That's why he didn't stop you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who's quit smoking.
Shall we talk or not, shall we stop the talk of corruption or not?
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
Or Saleh stopped corruption.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you are very patriotic.
We won't be able to hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I hope you didn't waste your time coming, we appreciate it.
It's not real.
I yearn every day to hear him, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Say it, just once.
Bless you, I am
Is it a cigarette? Just say stop corruption, please.
He said: "Jay, do it for him, just once."
This is wonderful.
Now, my dear
About the job.
You are a loyal citizen, and very beloved by us.
We wanted to speak to you to inform you,
Sichinfrinx would have shamed you in public.
Are you serious?
They all said there were no vacancies.
They did want to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now, how will you save money for you and your mother?
And do not forget that.
She has four children.
O God, grant us help.
Do not exceed.
Don't lose hope.
You will never stop.
You must look for a job every day.
So as not to anger my father.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
What he's doing these days you don't know.
I told you.
But you never listen to me.
"O Allah, guide him."
I can't go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
Certainly, he will think so in this way.
You are right.
But, it's serious.
We have to do something.
They say he's going to replace you. You know that kind of rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind it.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to get him away from influencing our interests.
I heard about Saeed stopping the corruption.
He lives in my neighborhood.
And He will treat it.
We miss your voice.
No good
And I admire you greatly.
Salem is a very good man.
And God willing, soon.
He will return, and we will enjoy hearing his voice.
Fahad himself asks about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you leave?
I've faced some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are a seeker.
I haven't heard of this for a long time.
How wonderful, please be kind.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about that.
Saleh said he agrees.
No, people, it's really hard.
What's wrong with you?
The man is asking you for financial help.
Abdulrahman, I've already left.
Why didn't you tell us you were looking for a job?
ok, This is your chance.
Go to him, let him hear your voice, and go to him tomorrow to ask for work.
He will certainly expedite your dispatch.
I want to help you.
Do you know what?
Forget it, go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Okay, wait a minute, man. Let's discuss this.
No, we don't want to.
Alright, alright.
I want to speak one last time, I was going to leave but I'll do it one last time.
What would Bu Fahd like to hear?
What problem concerns him the most? You know, there are a lot of problems here, many, many.
What does he prefer to hear? Or does he prefer riots, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Seventy-eight centimeters.
Corrupted it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the officer do that?
Where is the seventh number? The seventh number.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, minister.
Why did the employee do that?
When the ministry moved to its new location
Bring your brother's cars.
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a dear people, meaning, this is the last time.
Because frankly, I had left.
Mother, didn't you say...
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man called "Stop Corruption" spoke about him on the radio.
I didn't listen to him, but some people told me about it.
I'm sure someone from the ministry exposed her.
Red on him.
He is free.
I agree, Minister.
Don't worry.
My whole day is dedicated to the service of the ministry, may God bless you.
Did you hear it?
I said that just for you.
Neglect me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdurrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Bou Fahad's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
And unfortunately, they reached her.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor is Abdurrahman.
He was behind all of that.
Bu Fahd is not like that, not at all.
You will do the same thing to him.
As long as I'm known.
No one will hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for a divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't do that.
We don't have any problems at all.
We are happy.
What is nepotism?
Everyone stands in line.
Because the system is here.
He got more rights than the foreigner.
We don't need foreigners.
We won't get that.
Your efforts and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important official
And your release
We don't have this here.
With my regards
Salem Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahairi
Known for stopping corruption.
I didn't want to have dinner.
I was running and spinning, tearing my shirt.
Because you're wearing a new shirt, he's jealous.
Walid saw me wearing the shirt I had just bought from Villaggio.
He pulled it jealously, tearing it.
He is a kind-hearted man, unable to scold.
I think
You, O Adil, saw my child beautiful in form, and you became envious of him.
It's not his right.
Why did you pull Waleed's shirt?
You saw him wearing a new shirt and got jealous, ask Dad to buy you a new shirt.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you
You are not obliged to hit yourself.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a small child, not your age, so have some shame.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to lift him up and fix him.
Not just the left.
Watch your language, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, to fix me.
You are arrogant.
Lift your child properly.
And if you are not able to do that
I respect him.
I don't want to scold him in front of his wife.
And my brothers
If Adol hits Waleed again.
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time arguing with you.
Act as you should.
Let me go and show her.
Do not contend with a fool.
Where are the past days?
The intentions were clear.
Forgive us.
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this one is the biggest.
Leave everything and come now.
Turn and look at the trouble we are in.
Yes, my love, tell me what happened.
Mr. Ahmed, sorry, I must go home, there's an emergency and I have to go.
Adoul's pants became empty.
He is a grudging and hateful person.
It is... It is Sultan.
How will the child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I did not use them, God is sufficient.
I'll show him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you went and talked to him, he wouldn't admit it, he would say it was the child.
So what do we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, my love?
Under his bed.
God has destroyed them, so let God destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
He is crazy, very crazy.
Now
And do not alter it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
Do you think our son Adoul is the one who caused their computer to malfunction?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
Don't say *
Go and mock someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you it's Advil.
Shake with someone else, Fahad, not with me.
Give me a chance, come on, please come.
The hearts were good.
The intention was clear.
Is there a child?
I'm going to look for friends.
He laughs, not me, O Sultan!
False accusation
Press the scissors.
Act properly.
Hello, Abdulrahman! Come quickly, son!
Come and see your brother Fahd and Salman.
They fight every day, my son!
I don't know.
At a meeting like this,
We must be
Think carefully about our actions.
and the deeds of those who came before us
We see.
It will be a lesson for us.
We need to learn from them.
Do not act like children like this.
As big as camels
You have children.
Zero-knowledge
You are his role models, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, Sultan
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother.
Bendable
I'll make him pay for the computer.
I moved his hands.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, I only shook his hands to escape.
From the hadith of Abdurrahman al-Lamtanahi
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you make this tea?
Leave, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Why didn't you say that Abdurrahman had made peace between you and him?
But, I swear if he doesn't calm down I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Insanity
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him, hold the tea.
On his head
Close your mouths, close your mouths, stop it children, they have no shame, they're hitting each other.
You're acting like little children, oh, stop it, my son.
I swear I'll show you.
Hit him, hit him, my son, hit him hard.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your screaming.
O Allah
Leave us alone.
It's shameful.
And I have reconciled you.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile.
He didn't have time, my daughter!
The poor have
God willing
He speaks fluently.
But, girls!
"O Allah, guide him."
You need to calm them down.
Don't provoke them to fight each other, girls!
What happened, I hope it's good.
You've disappointed me, Abdulrahman!
I wanted to help you, not do the same thing.
You are my wise brother, O son, may God guide you.
Two consecutive strikes.
*Stretch your arm*
You have wronged us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Oh! Officer, we've told him again and again.
You're not believing him, officer.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Sorry
Don't say *
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
This means it's very far away.
My brother was right when he said he was wrong.
I'm sorry, but now I've signed that your children won't do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello brother, hello
Officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Assistant Under-Secretary
The intermediary is the head of a public authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and lie down.
!Panadol medicine! Officer
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
"O Lord, suffice the enemy with sufficiency."
"O Lord, suffice the enemy with sufficiency."
"O God, grant my enemy enough to satisfy them, for they have exhausted me."
What is this?
A child thrown that far!
This is an adult's hand, it seems to be his father's.
Do you believe that?
He seems to be from a respectable family, nice and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what?
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say that you didn't get a chance.
When I passed by, I looked at you, what does that mean?
It's just a coincidence, you think!
You shook your head, and she shook hers, at the same time.
No, but there's definitely something.
I notice when you enter.
She feels happy, deep in her heart.
Go and ask her about a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, believe it or not.
Romantic, more than it should be.
Come on, man, it's the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly speaking, I'm not sure if I can do that.
It's been a long time since we sat and talked like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you must go and rest now.
Especially after the outdoor photoshoot in the desert last night.
We were tired, long hours, I told the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, no contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
O Allah, Your aid is what we seek.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has been sold and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
It is God who has decided that for them; we will not influence Him.
Good morning, uncle.
What's wrong?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems the battery is the cause.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
O Allah, grant him abundant good.
At any time, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby to visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Enough, man.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashid Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighborhood before housing.
I want to take a picture with him.
My colleagues can trust me.
He couldn't believe our house was right next to the actor Rahid Abdullah's.
To talk to him, until he believes.
What a life.
What we were seeing on television.
And I hope to see him.
Praise be to God, thank you God, our neighbour has changed, thank you God.
If they need a sailboard, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but gentlemen, be nice to me, I'm still not very used to it.
I heard about that.
That was his kind deed, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
That being said, it was confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the ministry's new branch in Dakhla.
Did they tell you who's moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard, I'm sure of it.
Is Bou Ali among them?
My name!
But we don't know exactly who we'll transfer.
I can't go, God bless you, smoke is bad for me, I can't.
Whether you can or not, business is business, man.
The committee is still studying the issue.
But if they choose you.
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Waleed. Take some.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We are like a family.
Oh! Bou Walid, that's so kind of you.
O Allah, grant goodness to Abu Waleed.
I really appreciated your kindness.
O God, preserve this love forever.
But, my daughter!
I'm ready to walk around the market for you until you find furniture that's more beautiful and at a cheaper price that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We must change it.
God willing
I've told you before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
Perhaps I won't cry for you (Idom)
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Because she doesn't care about you.
No more.
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But those people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment.
And I will give you the green light to present them to me.
I told you.
No, Mother, don't worry.
And you will come and ask me to intercede for you.
I set the dinner in the living room.
If you wanted to eat.
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
So, who's this car?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people love good.
Yes, you're right, Dad!
Even our relatives wouldn't do that for us.
Of course! Is my name on the list?
Are you sure?
What's the matter, why do problems follow us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, hearing this news, what I'll do, I don't know.
God bless you, God bless you.
What happened, Abu Ali!
Because the committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be helpful, oh! Ya Umm Ali, I don't think it will be helpful.
I contacted him, and he said it's not possible.
The famous artist
Consider that your name wasn't on the list.
May God bless you, thank you very much, Abu Salem.
Please
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
O Allah, bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Certainly, may God bless you.
Come please, come.
Certainly, I'm happy to help.
You and those you love
You told me a couple of days ago.
Mom, be ready.
Am I ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said: "I don't mind."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
But, my son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
Be fashionable.
I don't have any elegant dresses.
You're putting me in a bind.
Why are you taking out all this jewelry? This is the first time I've seen you do that.
I don't have that.
Mother of Ali
Um Ali will propose to her son.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewels.
She wants to show them that they are rich and have great wealth.
God willing (surprise)
She's lucky.
God willing, is this my wife? She's taller and bluer.
God willing, I will listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You also need to be prepared.
They will ask you to meet her father.
I certainly won't go in this dress.
When I enter with my new clothes
Mother, be careful with her belongings.
It's kind of Um Walid to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So we should be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to give him a show?
That was for the women.
I have to go and meet the men.
As you can see, God bless you.
Just the vest remains, God bless you.
Good people, they helped me.
They were helpful, just a bit late.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
All people stand for you.
Yes, but brother Rashid, should I unpack it like this or hold it?
No, look, first.
You have to tie this.
It's preventing me from breathing.
The garment (men's clothing) is loose, but
Bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The right hand is relaxed, like this.
You're wearing the lower dishdasha.
Wow, wow
How wonderful!
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Oh! PW, yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
They didn't give you, okay, seconds.
Put your left hand like this, the left one, like this.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What about it?
You know what she was telling me earlier today.
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be separated from each other."
I will ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and embarrass him and embarrass herself.
I see many grooms interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad wants you for her brother, and today this one wants you for his sister.
They want to take my beloved.
I'm just sitting here watching.
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Alright then.
From tomorrow, they must know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
أنت ترفض ولدي وليد.
The ferry is more honest than you, two-face!
But you,
They work all your life.
That doesn't reflect you.
To serve people
To the lies of people.
Clothe yourself in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
Me or you!
I wore accessories, gold and jewelry.
Play
Because you're getting married.
What is the scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He wears a keffiyeh (traditional Arab clothing) over the sides of his face.
Do not look right, left, or behind.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Does he have a daughter and a son?
Why is he walking like that?
As said,
"O God, grant me sustenance, O man."
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the city center.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look good with you sitting.
It looks better when waking up, when you're standing, stand, stand, stand.
I beg you, Thursday.
What about you, are you going downtown?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
You're satisfied with that!
* O Thursday
Turn it on, and if it's a female host...
I change the channel, fearing that it might have caused me trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with my friend at work, Salem.
Talk to her.
She cut me off the phone, take it, take it.
She hung up the phone, and now she's going to bother me.
Now she says I allowed you to talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you might throw me out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! My brother.
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
I am empowered by you.
She said, "Don't let her go."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Especially Salim is one of the best men in our city.
He told you he wants a divorce.
If he asks me about divorce, am I stupid to divorce, this is unbelievable.
Thursday, you've officially gone mad.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
"O Allah, guide him."
A poor man, it's so painful.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
"Whom do you want to give it to? May God guide you."
No, no, nothing, nothing.
Give it to me, I'll get it for him.
Reschedule my meeting with the women's delegation for tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm speaking to you with genuine awareness.
Oh! My brother.
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we remove your name?
The only one who can remove your name is the Honorable Minister.
Meeting at the ministry
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
What is the lady you were talking to?
Salma Salem, Salem, I swear she was Salem.
If you were talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lie doesn't work.
Don't lie, Khamas.
You won't tell the truth!
You are wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
What a miserable life.
"O God, bless you, Salem called."
Let him see that she believes.
He asked you to call.
It's none of your business.
Don't interfere in others' affairs, or you'll do something uncomfortable.
They gossiped about you.
Hello!? Dear!
How can you live with a woman with a sharp tongue?
Start the meeting now.
Hasan went to call Khamis.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
We start.
We hope he finds it.
He was terrified when he saw the ladies.
I've searched the entire ministry and you're hiding here.
Let's go, let's go, people are waiting in the meeting room.
I cannot sit with the ladies.
Oh! Thursday, how will you recognize your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
*OMG* You want her to doubt me, don't you?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Is your wife going to call at this time!
Certainly, since your company is large.
This project that your company will implement for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Hello! People, why is the table shaking?
No, a long time ago, not the table, me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to speak to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He lost consciousness because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that his wife said not to come home unless you change your job and don't work with ladies.
Therefore, I sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What about his wife?
This is madness.
Ask him who he is talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What shall we do! Your wife and children are coming tomorrow.
What should I do? I don't know.
As much as you've done what you want, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
ok, Give her the papers.
Ok, I did that, I sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and verify
Insha'Allah we agree, if you agree, I will return home tonight.
Sister, here is the minister's signature.
What more do you want?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
An office and a job different from the one he used to work in.
Where is this department, bless you.
Yes, God bless you, here is the minister's permission.
Nothing, nothing, this one, on your right.
Yes, may God bless you.
Enter, your office is ready.
Saud and Abdul Qadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
Why are you asking about transportation?
The circle is all women.
My wife
No one can execute another's decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Hello brother, agree with your colleagues.
And by the symbol of the males, that the wife may know [her husband's] right.
I added two more to the new employee.
The new employee, he is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office transferred a man to work with us.
You're serious!
It looks funny, the poor guy working among five women, it looks funny.
They say his wife is extremely jealous of the other women around him.
An envious eye.
A poor man, he is in need.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, and we complied and didn't speak.
Yes, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
***** See if it's your size?
My son called, he said my wife is going to the office.
What are you doing?
Go straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is in the welfare office.
With the fifth ***
These are six employees.
And here he is, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife envies other women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
"O Allah, guide Sultan."
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
Yesterday, my brother and I were drunk at the bank.
That project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and getting ready to go.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
A scorpion sting is painful.
This is important for the rain, look look
Search, uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
Rescheduling the meeting for tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must implement
They need to realize that you are an important observer.
They bear many responsibilities and obligations.
They consider women as servants.
I've never seen people who hate women like them.
What age do they think they are living in?
They asked me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the maids?
And the other one escaped a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their mistreatment.
I understand them.
O Allah, Your aid is what we seek.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Well, they mean something like that.
In fact, a compound of villas cannot exist without a garden.
Okay, now the park.
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
Dear Fatoum, I must go, I'm late.
Tell me, what do you have?
I speak or I go.
And play with it at school.
A committee from the Women's Association came today.
I was nominated by the school to participate in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
If you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see anything good.
You're the cause of it.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and keep me company? It's been a long time since I last saw you.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married or still unmarried?
"O Allah, guide me."
Who would agree to marry someone who is illiterate and has no educational qualifications?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's illiterate, he's a man.
And Khamis is the son of Sakurbon.
His scorpion sting is painful.
And likewise, one should marry someone of the same social standing.
A scorpion like him.
O God, grant us help.
What can I do, Aisha!
Since the minister traveled, all the papers were referred to me.
Inform Mustafa, head of the Human Resources Department, that I would like to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
You have the schedule.
And now I am free to talk to you, Ayesha!
Yes, Mary.
I'm coming, I'm coming now.
What should I say, O Aisha!
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
My love, it's okay, the ice packs are necessary for your face so it doesn't swell.
Why didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about this matter?
I went to them, they hit her.
Do you know if you've told them that this is football.
They had won you over a long time ago.
How embarrassing, you're playing football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
They learned that the one speaking to you is he.
The Great Crab
That little one
Yes, but uncle, I didn't hit him, the sultan did.
Did you hear that you did that?
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because they are in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's not your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't be greedy.
Okay, scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Going to the Scholarship Office
And liberate architecture.
Take your time.
To ensure that
I spoke with Sultan and Saqir.
They won't object to your marriage to Monira.
What more do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves the best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your appointment to join the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Until I tell you the truth,
They care about you a lot.
And your suggestion from the minister.
He is right.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I am astonished.
Their car installments will be paid from my salary.
And I assist the household.
She wants me to travel with her too.
Aren't we going to marry her this week?
What are you saying?
Foolish Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
Done, let's go.
This is shameful.
They will kill her if she refuses.
Oh, son, I've told you several times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
No worries, as long as he's a Scorpion's son.
His appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
Go to the kitchen.
And put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona tonight.
I hope Valencia doesn't defeat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is faithful and diligent in her work.
What do you think about that?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God bless you and grant you a long life.
Long life
Coffee service is available there.
Happiness
May Allah grant her a long life.
Hello, may God bless your life.
Good evening, Your Honor.
Yes, may God bless you with a long life.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We will play in China the day after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister, Mary.
I will go to the official engagement.
You are stupid.
You know something about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Welcome to %pw
Yes, ma'am.
Mix it and make a new one.
The next phrase
You know, Michelle called me a few minutes ago.
What can I say to her?
That's sad, Noof's role isn't suitable for Mishal.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
The torchbearer appears to be in her twenties.
Why doesn't Mary take the role?
It suits her better.
"Nouf for thirty"
We have to exclude the picky person from the committee.
It's complicated, and I'm sure it won't allow him to work smoothly.
It's detailed.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hamed can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
Nothing indicates that it's ours.
And if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company is issued in the name of Hamed's wife, bless you.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, come in.
I just spoke to them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
It was produced by the Modern Touch Arts Institute.
It's a series of bold, unusual, and beautiful actions.
I agree with what Hamed said.
The story of the series is very beautiful.
I agree with you.
I loved when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
And she wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And I didn't know it was for her son. It's exciting, and when the police came...
And her son comes from school.
Pushing a cube.
He kicked it and it flew through his mother's window.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
And it is good that a local company produces this advanced level of output.
We should encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and thoughts on the series, this is "blackmail of the conscience."
Exhausting human values
The shocking disgust
One and a half people per ring.
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
It does not carry a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why should they make the audience cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
It is clear from the meeting.
That there is an agreement between you.
I've organized it.
Some people understand because it's their field, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I don't agree with this series.
He's afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Ms. Samira.
What should I do? I don't know.
I don't believe it, Nasser!
For the new series we will produce soon.
What made the driver rape the daughter.
The blessings of the things we got because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
So they present it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
It's a nice role.
You've played a similar role, haven't you? Haven't you seen "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
That's called extorting something, I can't remember what.
Yes, extortion dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
The past series were all about girls.
You notice that each chain has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your turn is secured.
You are very beloved.
You're lucky.
Yes, Omar.
Yes, okay, alright.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Eat and go.
He said he wanted to meet me on a very urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
He spent half an hour with him.
And you told him you would bother him.
I told you that the minister complained to us.
What happened is that the minister's office called me and wants to meet with me.
I fear the minister will believe that, too.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to clarify his viewpoint concerning the series.
This is all.
This is true, perhaps you will live long.
But first, Your Honor, I would like to say that it is not acceptable to speak about a colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He is envious of everyone around him.
He cares only about financial gain.
But it's his specialty.
But, bless you, no educated person can deal with these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
Awareness of exploitation, the series we're working on.
It's a blockbuster.
We will launch a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your specialty. You know more about this than I do.
And I swear to you by a great chain.
That will defend our name.
Look at what journalist Abdulhamid wrote, listen listen.
And an actor said:
That the series promotes unethical ideas.
That's just a decline in manners.
This is indeed bold and powerful criticism.
They are in big trouble if journalist Abdulhamid continues writing about them.
Even if the people accused were aware of it.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle her.
They are grunge.
We need to create our own website.
And listed all the activities of our company.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are a media consultant.
The anime series produced by Mercury Media is considered to be a masterpiece.
Qualitative Advancement in Arab Drama
Because he carries moral values and ideas.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
He is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite view?
How can he accept that?
Journalist Abdulhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me what I thought of the series, and I told him it would be the best in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel our series is going to be a hit.
I don't know where he is.
The other one prepares and updates for the trip.
Not an interesting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events didn't actually happen.
Clear at first glance
Your writers are stupid.
That might happen.
Your serial number is illogical, irrational.
What do you think?
It is very tragic.
Other bad series are no excuse.
This production can be understood at first sight.
These are the hidden lines and dimensions, they need someone who focuses to discover them.
By the way, it's a political series.
It is shameful to be looked at in this way.
What's wrong?
You weren't this nervous yesterday.
I was at the Souq Waqif with Ali yesterday.
We were at a café.
You neglected me.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? The minister is angry, this is a big problem.
Within one week, we will all be laid off.
It's a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the series is a failure and contains no events.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Look what Nasser will do.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
To him be hope.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't change me, change me, change me.
Sorry
That day I was on vacation.
I will never allow them to write it.
But frankly, I haven't received any congratulatory messages.
Once again, great success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
The Expanse is the best television production.
Live long, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I'm about to have a heart attack.
In a moment, tell me.
You're lucky, the minister is pleased.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch Conscience Exortion II
No, no, no, no, enough brother.
The chain, he said, will not write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All This Trouble
Third and fourth as well.
What's wrong with you, you don't want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What the wizard can do
I wish you further success.
Please tell us your opinion on that success.
"O Lord, I thank You for this success."
They are jealous and envious of our success.
I find that strange.
This series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They've been awarded for that, surely they notice what we don't.
Preparing the second part of the series.
Good luck, you have a long life ahead of you.
True warrior
You will see, "Conscience Exortion" will be.
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Festival TV also lies!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and become clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch.
He is nominated in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it, award it, so people see it as high-class.
Yes, that's correct.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your arrival.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Please come to my office.
We weren't a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't reduce it.
Otherwise, we will terminate the contract.
We already signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company.
Cup and whip
As you wish
He did a great job.
It will be the first in the world to produce this product.
He is not just the best baker in the world.
I'll tell you.
How can bread be with (salsa)?
Open it with your hands or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and it might cut your hand.
So he made bread with yeast.
To put the cheese and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
What do you think, in fact, it's the bread bag.
How can we remove that zipper?
If that's the case, one could tell their friend, "I ate two locks."
Why weren't the Noor Mountains Hospital pastries delivered yesterday?
I knew, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make them
Once again, use the baker.
That's what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
So what, what's the problem if some employees from the company take some for fun with them?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven main players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you angry with him?
But they are good for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and they are the 12th player.
I invite you to have fun with them.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When I first told you he wanted to play soccer.
Listen to you.
He did nothing.
No, you're only angry at him because he took some employees to play football in front of him and enjoy themselves.
I didn't say he couldn't take some employees.
If some of your friends need some employees, you can lend them some.
Important bakers
My son, why do you take important bakers, this cannot be.
Next time, inform me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamadi handle this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why didn't they inform you?
I finished work, and as I was getting into my car
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find a goalkeeper and that they had an important match today.
Our goalkeeper said he'd found one, and then we arrived at the stadium.
Goalkeeper's uniform
I never played soccer and I've never touched a ball.
This case
Impossible.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
Let me explain.
Father, you want me to disband and dismiss the team, don't you?
Yes, that's correct.
Okay, Dad, please, I beg you.
I can't let the team go, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations to the winner.
Congratulations, Nasser, on your cup win.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked hard.
At the hotel
She congratulates you all, and there will be a party, as promised.
Your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he's just miserly and stingy.
Brother Abu Nasir, firstly, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a great success
"Oh Allah, bless you, no, no, no."
No picture without a bisht (traditional Arab men's cloak), wait, wait, hold it.
No, no
He is wearing a bisht.
Your interest, concern, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan
But, they played 5-5-3-2 in the finals.
And like athletes, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet it didn't confuse the Packers' team, and their execution was superb.
And the coach's plan
By Nasser, as the first players in the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest for the players to do?
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome. Is Hamad Sultan with them?
They are welcome, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, great!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz!
That is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Do not envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors' deputy that we use in the factory. (Note: The original sentence is not grammatically correct in Arabic, so the translation maintains that structure.)
You see.
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
The ball introduced me to him, I reminded him of that.
I said to him, "O Abu Abdulaziz."
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
What does this have to do with you?
The ball was always close to me, just fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, he didn't come today either.
There is a seminar on football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he should be there.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As always, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What about the International Bakery Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive overhaul.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
This is a small amount of money, just one million dollars for all these efforts.
No man, be generous.
It's not my fault, brother Shahin.
My mistake.
So what's my mistake?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
Prices for the Gulf are the highest.
So if the player costs two thousand dollars.
As for gold, it costs three or four million dollars.
I don't know, explain it to me.
Receive my fax from here.
And read it to me when you have it with you.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily defeat Bell and Ronaldo.
But it's written as eight hundred thousand.
Yes, that's correct, God willing, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the United Arab Emirates, they sell it for one million two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we inspect the goods?
Here.
Lower leg
Good, okay.
No, no, no, I can't guarantee that to you.
He is fat, God willing, well, he is fat.
This is agile, good for the center.
The intercostal muscle
It is the most important muscle, a player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Let your driver take them to the Automat Club, automatic, I said! Automatic.
Why
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yes, we bring them from African forests.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
Gladly, you can take it. Do you have a place for it or shall I bring it with the delivery truck?
When he saw that they were putting pressure on us.
The striker asked to play.
They were the pillars of their faith, no doubt.
Ask the defender to play.
Kajumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it were on Mars
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I don't like the way he runs the game.
This should be on the way to the north.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's in two days.
What's happening, why are you screaming?
Your foolish son
He is not convinced that the coach is not an expert in football.
Listen to her; she talks just like Mitsu.
And he knows that the guilty player, Seloulo Tikafawo, is a good central player, as Ahmed Altaib said.
No one will give you a headache.
Stay away.
I know how to handle him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
And the end Takulamakakolalala...
Ask the coach to change ...
To expel Hopway Malalo
Oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
It's unexpected to happen.
Players must not do that.
Postpone these matters until the end of the game.
People are watching this, this is happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he's the star of the match today.
This coach is wrong.
Tell him, my uncle Bou Nasser doesn't want you because you are his team's coach.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you stay on the bench, do what I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You've made me feel afraid, tell me what's wrong with you?
Mother, divorce me, divorce me.
Divorce you! How?
I don't know, Mama, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without any reason!
Yes, Mama, yes.
I swear to God, Mama, I don't know, he suddenly came and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him why? He said, "You're divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's happening?
They were married for only a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
What should I say?
I only know that he divorced her, from you now.
Sit down. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
I insulted Barcelona.
Abdullah, the light of my eyes.
He came to me crying.
He said she insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to this team and respects it.
She insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me, "Mother, she cursed Barcelona," so I said to him, "Divorce her and I will find you another wife."
I'll tell him that your daughter is divorced because she left Barcelona's team.
Just, that's why he divorced her, are you serious?
It doesn't bother me.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife tests her husband's loyalty.
What I hear is unbelievable!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international differences.
This time, you started laughing at Messi.
Problems between a couple occur, and we must...
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'll be angry with you.
Don't worry, son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
(Translation not possible as no text was provided to translate.)
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Of course, my love.
What's wrong with her!
Her name is Mona.
She was married for one month?
If I told you her story and why she got divorced, you wouldn't stop laughing.
We want your attention so we can share with you.
What's the use of a person like this, who divorces his wife for a football team?
The tribe recognized them and told me the whole story. Mother, don't involve me in this; I don't want to be in trouble with this person.
So, you think hairdressers' talk is nonsense.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming to her.
I told her, "Girl, don't stop at your luck."
If it were only her wealth, I wouldn't mind.
But she will stop her luck and ours with her.
This building
He won't reject me.
God is sufficient against this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Do not listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand not to close the door of opportunity that will be opened for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You are just merely merely merely merely merely merely merely merely merely merely merely merely
Forget all this nonsense and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
It might be her fault or something wrong with her that led him to divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Burjain slip through your fingers.
What is this, Abu Burgaain?
But when they get closer, they discover it's two towers.
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Borgin.
O Allah, accept from us and from you.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God grant you a long life (proverb), they took the amount, you signed and they spent it.
Happiness, I was preoccupied and it seems you were very busy too, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, divorced.
He was also married and divorced.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, brother. Be firm with him.
Oh! Goodness, this is a tough generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
My greetings, my greetings, my daughter.
My daughter, don't forget your coat. I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when boarding the plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Yes, my son, you are unwilling to go to London?
Hello, Mom.
Certainly, this is good.
So you can come with us and buy as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mama
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
My daughter, tell me, what's happening?
You did well to neglect her.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, you're supposed to be taken care of in every way.
Is it logical for her to sit while pouring water?
The glass is next to you, don't pick it up and let you drink.
You didn't get a good upbringing.
You must tell her that since my birth, I have only drunk water from my mother's hand.
What's wrong with her?
She began to look very sad.
And who is this lady with her?
Her name is Michelle.
How awful, she got divorced during the honeymoon.
Would you believe her if she told you her story?
"Oh Allah, bless you, Auntie. Thank you."
Your aunt asked, and so did your other aunt.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Hello, Mama.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
Your question to me, I don't know what happened between them!
In fact, this is illogical.
So where is Monira?
She's in her room talking to that fool.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
(Translation not possible as no text was provided to translate.)
We'll wait and see what he has.
How do you know he's angry? The boy is coming from outside, tired, and wants to relax.
Every day I tell my mother to peel the apples, but she doesn't. Every day she bothers me.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin on.
She doesn't peel the apple.
Hello, let me tell you.
You are divorced.
And others as needed.
Go, my beloved, the light of my eyes.
Go, my beloved, the light of my eyes.
Moneyra, what did he say?
Why are you upset too!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Close your mouth, God may give you health.
I don't know, Mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and went to tell you.
(Translation not possible as no text was provided to translate.)
Yes, he has nothing to say.
She will dance twice or three times.
Let him die who divorced my daughter.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'll pour my anger out on this disgraceful man.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are a toy for you and your son.
They won't have families and mothers who taste the bitterness in their mouths.
Who are you laughing at?
And to divorce them as you please.
She didn't help you drink water, she insulted Barcelona, fire her and forget about her.
Those who went to a nightclub.
Without shame or modesty
A minor minister, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Stay still and don't move.
You have some humanity.
It was my father's.
Who would sell land like this?
Abu Sakr took it from his father by force.
Why is he selling it?
O Allah, guide us. When Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
God willing, man.
Enter, come in.
Come on, come on.
What happened to your project, Abu Sa'd?
As you know.
Alright, last week you said you'd go to his office?
I told you, if you want to manage your project, you have to start by paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
"Doesn't he eat? Doesn't anyone in the world eat?"
This is not the problem, brother. We will let him eat and feel full, and we will fill his stomach. The problem is how to reach him.
And you must know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I met him during the Umrah pilgrimage and greeted him several times.
You don't need to know him as long as you pay him and run your business, you just need to know the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you at dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Oh! Man, anyone.
He loves to socialize and hang out with friends.
It's very fun to stay at this farm at night.
Yes, sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency located behind the mall.
He wants to get to know you, madam.
I got the license.
Like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your Falcon license.
Bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Say yes, sir.
And a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
My work is going well.
That means you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't be stupid.
Yes, it's fine, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what technology is, what has it done?
Circumstances were in my favor.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a small gift.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Go, go, take me to him.
Yes, that happened.
I just left the hospital.
He underwent a tonsillectomy.
And he will certainly hold a feast.
Welcome, you who deserve the health of your son, you who are honored.
We hope he recovers, we hope he recovers, God willing, he will not see any harm, God willing.
We met at the Crosses Store.
I think so.
Oh! Man, we're starting to forget and get old.
And they told me that your son Shahin was in the next room and has left.
I thought of visiting you.
And congratulations to you from Shahin and Wellness.
Listen, sir, you must not go without dining with us.
I don't feel like it.
Say yes or no.
Because our dear son Shahin has left the hospital.
In the Corniche Tower.
Say yes.
Oh! Son, don't be stubborn.
Mother, don't try, I don't like business and I'm not inclined towards it.
Who can start a business without capital these days?
At the car and bulldozer agency, he said just let it catch the eye.
It is God who loved you, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Even in college,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Whatever God wills, my father is loved by everyone, you just remember him.
Hello! People borrow from banks to start a company or business.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is also something new.
This is sakkar, my dear, he brought them to me yesterday and said they were samples, try them.
He only took their agency yesterday.
You see.
He also told me that all businessmen are like me; God bless all people like you.
Yes, sir.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
In fact, I love it.
I don't know who owns it.
My greetings, my greetings, O Uncle Saker, my greetings.
Bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is this to come in as a partner and take it easy (using the jargon)?
You, you can now say no.
So what's the matter?
What should I say?
Be her partner.
You don't know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said I am a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I have work experience.
I said, "I have a bakery, praise be to God, from which I get my daily bread."
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice that.
No, oh! Brother, the name is not nice.
Therefore, it's a fitting name for Iranian bread.
I came, big bread.
Big Bread Bakery, we'll call it.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, my lord.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
It's your happiness that she sent her car for repair and came to pick up mine because she is an advertising agent in a marketing company and she can't do anything without the car.
Maybe your car will need it too.
No, I don't need the car today.
Yes, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent, Dr. Sami!
Yes, sir.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study either business or economics.
He has never read a book throughout his life, not even a newspaper. I have never seen a newspaper in his hands throughout his life.
You all know who Sakkar is today.
I didn't want him to enter this business, and %pw.
His uncle Abu Nasser is still alive before you.
The one he loves.
But there are people born for business, who naturally love business.
You're right, Doctor!
Good luck, Shahin. May you be like your brother, God willing.
God is generous (everlasting), we hope.
It's still early.
These matters depend on upbringing.
No one can be like you, Doctor.
Frankly.
How did Sakr, who hates trade, easily reach this great economic understanding?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count him among them.
Do you know, Abu Sakar?
Sakar chose the market dome.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser?
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Sakra bin Abu Sakra wanted to take over the car dealership from his father?
You no longer own the agency.
Certainly people are never satisfied.
His father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Frankly, the doctor said his condition is critical.
This won't work.
Nothing will work.
Shock or impact, not my concern, I tell you, you will fire it, fire it and fire it.
There are such people in the 21st century.
We meet with you, dear viewers, with one of the kind and compassionate men in this country.
A man knows the way to the beggar and the deprived.
So, we have the founder and the owner of the Sakra Charity Institution.
Certainly, if we speak about this organization, Your Highness,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to present to the world and of course to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
All praise to God, the Lord of the Worlds, we were recently able to offer thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, thank God, we are ready to deliver.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
Whatever God wills, O our Lord, God may make many people like you.
My wife and I have just left home.
But my wife will be passing through here for half an hour to open her new project.
I await her.
Good.
In fact, I love their company and enjoy sitting with them, I really have a good time.
And to my children's source of income.
My whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Well, hot bread, hot bread.
God bless us, folks.
There are such people in the 21st century.
There are such people in the 21st century.
If someone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
He needs brave men.
Souq Waqif
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from goodness.
I want to say something, but please say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin must go to the showroom and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The air blows upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breeze, for love, take me home.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, but you sent me a text yesterday saying it would be ready in ten days, oh! Silly.
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes longer.
And God willing, you'll start talking to Al-Anoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but Anond will not be angry.
What else do you need, Fadi? They're starting to feel jealous.
Oh God, I love the way they speak, I envy them unlike our people.
Don't let me forget the matter.
Is your dress ready?
Here you are, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I'll pass by your place next week to get the dress, okay, bye.
How can I assist you?
Send the dress to my home.
No, I didn't like it.
Masha'Allah, today I went to Fadi at the shop, and he is doing exceptional work with girls coming and going.
God bless you, we were very successful in this project.
What's up?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong with him?
Look at the jealousy!
And we never heard him start a business, where would this bankrupt get the money from.
Open their mouths, plunder!
And when he starts his work,
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, you will do nothing?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
Okay, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you,
You want to start a business.
I know nothing about such things, may God guide you, my uncle.
Design, women's fashion design, and the like?
Who lied to you?
I'm a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You have a consultation you need, you need %pw I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you uncle, thank you uncle.
So give me, I must go.
Come in, sir.
The first time you tell me if I need a raise.
Fadi, for God's sake! Clean the shop, I see you're busy.
The shop is no longer sufficient.
I said you would rent the shop next door, put your trust in God and take it.
I hope so.
Did they rent the shop next door?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction at my friend's place. His name is Essam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and read his name on it.
What's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, what's wrong with it.
What's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, there's a flaw in it.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
I said I must destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nesser.
Is he the shepherd of what he says?
And I was trying to test you, I told you, "Do you want to open a project?"
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I have no problem with you or your requests.
But this doesn't lead you to...
A man, these are the means of livelihood and everyone takes their sustenance.
You hit me.
Alright, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh has crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer was brought in.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our ladies, they love Lebanese men.
Oh! Madam, this looks wonderful on you, no, no, no, this one, this is unparalleled in all of Doha.
Oh, this suits you, madam, and these beautiful words and the piece that's worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty or forty thousand.
Yes, just do as he does.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Oh! Sir, I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented across Doha.
See, if you want to be successful
What's exactly wrong with this person?
Why don't you know?
That means he stole the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place, sir?
Don't mention it, don't mention it, Fadi.
By this time they will be playing by themselves.
This means we're defeated, no!
We are compelled to confront them!
And we're bringing our customers back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress that you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
I've set a crystal on it. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the entire world, and this piece is extremely unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are internationally recognized.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's wrong? What happened?
They are our enemies, O Sa'd, they are our enemies.
Is this what they do?
They killed us; we don't have any clients left.
This is what is called war, Abu Nasser.
We won't stand idly by!
We must fight them as they fight us and also respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
And I will start a war against them, and you will see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop.
See the ad!
Check the ad he's posting!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We publish an ad in a quarter page.
Look, he published a half-page ad.
I have no idea what he intended to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
Not a single customer had entered their store for six days.
No, they didn't open this afternoon, they closed.
And you will hear that he has put his shop up for sale.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
Even they couldn't sit there, so he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
"What's wrong with you? Can't you just drink it? It's always a problem."
Is there anyone who bears a grudge against you?
There is a person, God bless you, who intentionally sprayed the store with this smell.
They are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are cousins, you are adults, not children to fight like kids.
He came at night and sprayed a bad smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything with your scent.
Do not cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I've prepared a hellish plane for him.
Without anyone catching me in a mistake.
No, everything is fine.
This is what baffles me.
I swear I don't know what's happening, this is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our store.
Oh no, this isn't the right shop, we should go to the other one, I've exposed my face, God guide you.
And what did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers are entering.
What I know is that it's as if they had cast a spell on him.
Ladies and girls, do not approach the store.
As if a spell had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Yes, is he asleep or awake?
Go and look at him, brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will fall.
You've lost, Sultan, you've lost.
I don't know, they turned him into a dog!
He made a monster out of him!
Control yourself, brother, don't get angry.
What I know is what he did.
Tell me, my love, what have you done to him? They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
I am its designer.
He is not Lebanese.
Did you tell him, did you tell him?
Don't you know its location?
The stars are hers and we desperately search for those additions.
Call the person again, they might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed? What's the matter with you?
What's the matter, Ahmed? You're just sitting there while the director is shouting at me! What am I supposed to do? Where are those bloody extras you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone. I've been in touch with him and got a headache until I asked Mr. Abdullah.
First of all, don't scream. We're actors and we need to relax a bit; we have to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man has called more than once in front of me, just calm down.
What do you say, Mr. Abdullah, what do you say?
Oh, Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director will finish the scene and shout at me.
Hello, guys. Hello, guys.
We want to finish, but these extras who were supposed to show up in the scene are still missing.
You don't want anyone screaming in your face, right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our state, screaming since morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself with a scene, and if God wills, I will bring you an actor who does a good job in the role.
It's true that he'll be playing a role in one scene.
But that scene is the most important scene in the series.
But, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if you're not ready today, I'll resign.
Men, let's go upstairs.
I'll tell you something. There's a Filipino, is that okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he will leave immediately. He needs someone who looks like a noble, he must be noble and Qatari.
Oh! Man, he'll wear a gutra and agal, no one will notice him.
Are you serious, Alaa? You want the easy way out, this production respects people's feelings and intelligence.
He gave you all the responsibilities, divided the tasks, and you'll be safe.
Calm down, so we can think. Reim, think with me, you might remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmedi, do you remember someone in the Salata district named Saud Al-Aliq?
The same Saudi.
Saudi says clean up!
The manager said he needs a wealthy man of high standing, and you're saying cans.
Dear, by the end of the day he is an extra actor, you will bring a rich and distinguished man for an extra role.
But with a little makeup, Reem, wearing a clean bisht and a luxurious thobe, and a fancy car.
Good luck, it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy hunter?
So who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
Yes, that's it, thank you very much.
And now, how will you work, Mama? There is nothing else but this antidote that Uncle brought from abroad.
Your son only has one suit.
Son, here she is inside the closet under my clothes.
People are waiting outside to see what I sweep.
"May Allah grant you sustenance, my son."
That day I will see you and you will be on television.
Yes, Mother, they said I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit, alas.
Well done, man. What's this? A lick on you.
Inhaler, inhaler.
Here it is, Mom.
Quickly, Mama, are you feeling better?
God willing, my son.
God preserve us, we hope they'll give you some money.
O God, grant us.
Pray for me.
Saud brings you the boxes, Saud brings the laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abboud, the son of Fatima, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will he perform the scene?
Yes, yes, we hope, we hope he'll do a good job, calm down and be quiet, so he gives you a complex role.
"How are you, Mother?"
She's not the person who collects tannin as she used to be.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
Now you are wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You won't change, I'll regret nominating you.
The man they brought to Abu Abdulaziz's house.
He's here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Gwail Fadhel.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I fear only God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the director tells you.
Oh! My brother! My brother! Please, do you understand or not? Will you play the role of one of the elite, one of the rich?
Here, boy! Here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is too empty, the role needs a balanced person.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
Brother, we bought this for the play. Listen, I'll take you to the dressing room now and teach you the part.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come on, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Please, I came here for you, clothes, clothes.
Boss, the car you need for the trip is ready.
Saudi, he she she she she she she she she
Let's repeat it again, and the assistant is here to see you and reassure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
Did he say this?
Yes, yes, I'll tell you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect that from you. Oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Beautiful, and you should know!
Let him brush my teeth, brother.
Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzooq, Jamil, will clean and complete the full name.
Beautiful, go, go and think.
And treat your daughter like a divorcee.
You don't need to think about why she got divorced.
Your daughter is divorced, is she pretty? Is she pretty?
She's beautiful, go and consider yourself, we're not engaging.
Why don't I spit on him?
Excellent, you are excellent and remember everything, excellent.
Let him clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh! Man, the homeowners surprised us and they need the hall, so the director decided to finish the hall scenes and then we'll shoot the exterior scenes.
How is this? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed to a later time. They'll be shooting another scene, and we'll catch up with them, God willing.
Should I tell them to bring you tea?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you too.
Good morning, sir.
Hello, which tribe are you from, boy!
My name is Salem Abu Shweih al-Shawi.
Shuy is famous.
You deserve it.
It hurts, my nose is big and also the lips can be placed here.
Tell me, brother, about people with thin noses nowadays.
I keep myself.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Press this for a minute.
Hello, Mama.
My mother is very sick, I must go quickly, Oh! My brother!
You'll go with that clothing.
I don't have time, I told you my mom is sick, she's very sick, she says!
Listen to me, you can go like this, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't leave the site.
I'm trying to find a taxi, brother.
What's a taxi? If you tried to look for a taxi for a year, you wouldn't find one.
You know, we're renting the car for the scene.
As long as it's free, take it.
Yes, brother, please give me the key. Mother is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
In the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Just a minute, one minute, I'll get the wheelchair now, now oh! Sir.
I can tell you something, can't I?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh! My son, my son, what happened?
Be silent and don't speak, just look and remain silent.
Peace be upon you.
No mistake, but my mother, your housewife, has asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to make the bed.
Good, good.
And don't worry.
God is sufficient for you; what have you done?
Yes, Rashid.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashood.
Come with me, Mr. Rashood.
And the master's taking Rashud and doing what is necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what you'd like to drink.
Follow me, Rashid.
Sorry.
What should I do? There are so many people, just wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first; Nasser, the hospital security guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was obliged?
No woman cares about me.
They philosophize and they demand.
He has no certificate, I don't want your mother, what, I don't want your mother! Go and find your friends.
Oh! Brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I love her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
I can't, brother, my heart is attached.
Your brother has fallen in love, do you think, when I see her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God curse you.
Madam, our intention now enjoys full health.
You are a professional actor, Saud, you guys next!
Bravo, see how they applaud you and praise you.
Now, go and change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh! Man, don't worry, come here and tell me about yourself first.
Yes, from now on my name is Falah Al-Marzouz.
He forgot and wrote Saud instead.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzouq, Abu Abdulaziz.
Bless you, my dear.
One buffet!
I accomplished two.
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are very sophisticated people, I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Well done, dear. Goodbye.
Look at this, Mom.
I must bring them something on the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
What's wrong, Mom?
Look at your brother who will bring us shame!
Yeah, that's embarrassing. By the way, it's cheap.
But this is based on our budget, it works.
Leave this for the maids to eat.
He wants to make us laugh.
I'm glad I saw that.
This type is the free class, which is for the upper class.
Almost above average.
No, we want something unusual, something no one else can afford.
"Forgive me, but you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities."
Shut up, shut up, you don't know anything.
For fear that the money I have is not enough.
No cash, pay by credit card.
What opulence, it's very advanced.
Salih signed his marriage contract yesterday.
Healthy Nasser!
I am at your service, I am at your service.
I'm coming for you.
They booked the small hall and the food was terrible.
Excellent and very cheap.
What she said about the Al Saeed wedding.
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
That's what scares me!
My dear sister,
He is only interested in money.
And he does not care about what people say.
He wants to make us laugh.
But we are supposed to bring something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take out loans and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and stop people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, the cheap chocolate is enough that you were about to insult us with.
She told you that the manager liked the dish and took it home with him.
Certainly, if the bride's family says we choose the ballroom, the stage, and arrange everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, nothing, but the store we go to earlier has a very good price.
In any case, this store designed Abu Thahab's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of his esteemed daughter, congratulations.
No, no, no, we don't need anything that's been used.
I need a platform that we'll be the first in the world to use.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and advanced.
How much does this stage cost with other arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and twenty thousand.
Money, money, by doing so, our funds are not sufficient, everything is the most luxurious, the best and the exclusivity all that costs money.
They all love it.
Please, be quiet.
What is the resolution?
Did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is more expensive by twenty thousand.
No, for the love of your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, no, I need Noah's Ark.
These are wedding expenses, by the way, we are considered middle-class.
Do I have to pay 150,000 for the stage and 150,000 for the dance floor, the ones booked by the Palais Royal as you call it?
I didn't say boxing, but why all the boasting and everyone wanting to look at each other and everyone wanting to show they're better than the other guy.
It's a battle of egos, and only wedding shop owners benefit.
Those who know that everyone wants to be special, exploit us and lie to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding shop.
He said that the stage wouldn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for that moment when his father says yes.
Well, do something.
Like other men who marry and control themselves.
Hello Sheikh, Your Highness.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I'm calling you.
First time in Qatar, designed by the world artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
You'll look great with a Noah's Ark stage.
There is no such harmony; you will be the first to use the nine planets in Qatar.
Certainly, then.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Certainly, then.
"O God, have mercy on you."
As You Like It (Aemilia)
Too many expenses, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get the full eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd.
How can I sort things out, Fahd, as long as we're proud at weddings, we're in trouble.
Without any exaggeration.
You will certainly receive the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we will start with the invitations.
Our marriage is better than theirs.
Let's see the invitations your son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
Now people travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitations, have them printed, and then returned. The same for Manar's family.
They went to France; even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country do you want to travel to?
We witnessed amazing calls.
In fact, it's expensive, but...
But it's unique and no one has done it before.
Glitter, I don't like it.
Gold will be much better, shining.
Ah! If he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did you get involved in it?
And leave off all this boasting and ostentation in weddings and all these unnecessary expenses.
The only beneficiaries of our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
He leaves, alas.
Let me go get him, he might not find anyone to take him.
I feel, we'll let you go.
Thank you, Abu Nasir.
Ah! The bride's family should support you.
I tried once, just once.
I told them that there was no need for a ballroom in a very well-known hotel.
Why, I found our daughter on the street, and others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Why did I tell you I was married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
And hey, man, these days they're having wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheaper and less costly.
That means you won't marry from your country.
Forget it, you want me to be crazy.
You will see.
If I don't bring Abdullah Roaised or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Curse her, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If you have Raeshid's number, give it to us so we can contact him.
Certainly, dear. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
We had agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
And will Umm Nasser be better than me?
I forgot who she is and who we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not quite it, Mom. Look at my brother Saleh; he broke my heart, and we didn't put much pressure on him.
In truth, he broke my heart.
Oh, really!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, she just suddenly fell.
I heard it and fell.
He had no reason, and no one could blame her, after she had prepared everything and people knew, he simply said he didn't want a wedding party.
He wants to bother us.
What did the doctor say?
He will humiliate us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
And God willing, everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
Oh! My son, you are a man and you are a provider.
Go, go and attach it.
I swear, if I told my father Yusuf, his heart would stop beating.
You know why the minister has kept Joseph's servant until now.
By the way, he should have retired three or four years ago.
There's no mistake in that, he will help me.
I swear, you're crazy.
I understand, what I want from him now.
And you will allow him to hide the papers and statements until you return the money.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're panicking.
There's nothing to worry about, and I'll pay you back at the end.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Well, well, I tried, but there's no other way but this.
I'll give it to you and the reviewers later.
They are strict in their scrutiny, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Tablet, tablet, tablet.
I ate, I ate the tablet.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will be in the hall to receive guests.
No, we will definitely be there.
I'm going to organize my son's wedding, which will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Certainly, Fatima. I'll talk to you later.
I'm worried for you that they will envy you, my son, if you enter upon them tomorrow like this with the bisht.
Is my beard length good, Mama?
The police are here!
Good luck, there's no mistake.
"Police, stay here and I'll be back."
O Allah, I seek Your aid against you, Salah.
They forgot your wedding ceremony.
Marriage cage, now I'm entering the prison cage.
They discovered the document I hid from you to get the loan, and now they've suddenly discovered me.
Why are you upset!
You'll hear about many more disasters than this.
What do we say then!
A respectable and honest employee
Those who love their work, the ministry contracted a company to perform maintenance.
The employee, anxious about his work, went to inquire about the materials.
He found its cost to be four hundred thousand.
He will save one million six hundred thousand for the ministry.
And the official punishes him! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why don't you believe it!
Here is Saad.
Of course, he has all the news.
He was fired from his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They said he called his office manager.
He told him, "Let her work instead of Uthman."
Who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that presented the maintenance offer.
What Uthman discovered.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always surprising, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
This is how we've become!
What do you say!
It's not about what I say, it's about this poor employee, Osman. What's his fault!
His mistake is that he is honest and loyal!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left just now.
What's wrong with the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve that, but there's nothing we can do about it.
It's not fair, Your Honor. He has seven children and no passport.
He earns his living from this work! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do I know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister hired.
I entered Uthman's office and started working. The poor Uthman came to take his things, I prevented him and told him to go and I would send his things with the tea boy.
Where is he now?
Things have changed, Othman!
This is the reward!
This is the will of God.
Blessings of the Most High God.
The Almighty God is ever-generous, O Uthman. God will not forsake you, farewell.
What's wrong? You don't look good!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
What work! I don't have the ability to work, I'm leaving right now.
It's an opportunity for me to pass by my mother and bring things to you.
I don't want you to stay angry like this.
Why are you shouting in my face? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is this normal, by what right are you going with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mama!
You're crazy.
People are liberated, the planet has become a small village, where do you live!
Oh, how one could say!
Be modern, live this time, and don't be late.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Go, don't look at me and lock it.
What's wrong, Saleh? What's with you?
No, you're not fine today.
You shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have an appetite.
Lest I forget the disasters I have seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The president is a little angry.
It is an honor for us, Your Highness.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Work hard and persistently.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Yes, Your Honor.
Tell me, what's the use of an official who doesn't take bribes?
It's not feasible.
That's why I want you all.
No place for honest people, people of principle, and outdated values.
If one day you discover
He just blames himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have any doubts
Tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nour doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't just want it to be this way, I want all of you to be like her.
Bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to choose; you picked the right thief for the right place.
Enough, ya! Ya Umm Saud, enough, don't worry me more.
I don't want to live in a prison.
But God is sufficient for me, He has tempted me and made me see truth as beautiful.
And he told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why do you care about honesty and integrity?
All your life, you've been a thief and a slacker.
I'm lucky I didn't turn out to be a good person.
Let me talk to your father.
You won't do that again.
One remains on the straight path, bribes, steals, and is hypocritical to enjoy comfort.
The father was imprisoned because all his money was ill-gotten.
Stop, stop.
Is this something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it revealed?
You're not ashamed, you're not frightened.
I'm too shy to wear a suit.
Are there any girls who are shy in our time?
Why are you screaming?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Is there any respectable lady who wears such a thing?
And will you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I've grown tired of her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I've never been hesitant to offer support here.
I bought her some see-through clothes that she doesn't need.
I'm warning you, if I ever see you wearing something below the knee.
Since you are aware of the situation, do not blame me for the consequences.
We are here, praise be to God.
Good luck, he's a playboy and a villain.
He is like his father.
As you can see before you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm bad.
A truly good man. Honestly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
We didn't know about it until we heard about it.
God have mercy on her, she has a very bad reputation.
I came home at 3:30 a.m.
She returned home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and take me from the bar.
Start your car engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time we've seen a father disobey his son.
Stop that, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary loves you.
I love you too, disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
"For, for, my father, my father is here."
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Let me introduce you to my friend, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-friend.
Welcome, come in, random opportunity.
Arabic translations and Israeli satellites
He discovered that many Palestinians hadn't cut their nails.
In accordance with the State of Palestine's commitment to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
In any case, the United Nations gathers today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinians' fingers.
To know if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should cut, tear, or draw blood.
Palestinian state
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Made of cork.
And olives, man.
We press the olives like this, this is how we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To establish an inspection committee for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, don't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Healthy, healthy, what happened to you?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh! Rashid, you must have a strong character.
Now, brother, this school that you will work at tomorrow is number?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What's your problem, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers with him are the ones who complained about him.
That far, brother.
That's why you see him as calm.
Then he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, but mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we're not talking to you to anger you.
We're telling you this because this is your last chance.
He told me that I had accepted Rashid, even though he was a weak character.
Hesitant and very good.
No matter what, he is still a citizen.
Why are you silent, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
The new Mr. Rashid.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
People, don't worry about this.
And from tomorrow,
Yes, this is good and what's next?
Here I tell you,
I am a teacher. I don't like mistakes.
Let me say that the boy jumped and told me what the other boy said at your previous school, and the inspector was there.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, open the door.
Good, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I tell you,
I'm nervous.
It's up to me!
Just be quiet!
It seems he just said, "Shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Mr. Rashid told him that he fired me.
It seems he said, "I don't care, but he will see, I don't want to see your face here in class."
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Whose son am I?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Saw it?
The problem, Professor, is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
The chair, the chair.
At the end of the day, he's human.
But you shouted in my face!
Friends who mock, you mock me.
The father is outside and will return next week, and when he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdulrahman, may God protect you.
We, we are friends. By the way, blueberry ice cream is very delicious, you might want to try it. It has a little tanginess, but it's wonderful.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is telling his father.
I said his father is abroad.
Yes, he's out there. Won't his father be back? That means they took his father's property and evicted him!
I hope there won't be any dire consequences.
I carried his bag and brought it to him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me, I'm your friend."
Yes, but.
Yes, but what?
You are the ones who told me.
Scream and claim that you are strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't worry, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put it on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I've gathered you, to listen to your ideas for the party.
How can anyone guarantee a child?
That will put us in a bind, it is him, and he is calling.
Third.
That is, hello. Pick up the receiver, I swear that's it.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Hello! Teacher, come, come here, hello! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not laughing, man, I'm asking you, are you done?
Whether I'm done or not, where is the teacher's authority? By doing this, you degrade yourself and degrade the teaching profession.
Good, good, okay, okay.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I raise my voice, first you must know who is this boy?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Stretch, stretch, we have a lot of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
"O Allah, grant them provision."
I am the school principal here.
Abu Nesser is known as
Use to provide all teachers with extra lessons.
Except me.
Who is the principal of the school here?
You are the school principal, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair, brother.
What do you mean?
No need, I swear by truth, I want to ease you.
What do they call it?
So what do we do with you now?
Do what's best for you, and you won't get extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you, go, go, go, get out!
Alright, I'll leave.
As you wish, we've told you, man.
So we can keep him in check.
Wait, people, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Salem.
Oh! Abu Naif, you are the neighborhood leader and you must stop him from crossing the line.
I am my father's son.
You'll see what I'll do to him.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Honor.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He grew a beard and his face turned yellow.
Do you believe that when he came, I couldn't recognize him, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he was promoted a week ago?
This means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell us, what secret pulled you from below!
I told you from day one,
When I study, I don't want to hear any noise.
And don't breathe.
Act properly.
And you also answer me, and argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good job along with you.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the other job, no brother give me options, different jobs and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear, I'm not in a good state after the phone call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What will they say, oh Mother, may God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, happy to meet you %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
They are offering me a bribe, that's the tender.
Happiness will come to us, a treasure, a treasure will be opened to us.
The big earth.
God bless you, Minister. Everyone, let's congratulate the new Minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Our greetings to you, Mr. Minister.
God's blessing, congratulations.
I offer you my condolences, Your Excellency. You deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister.
Brothers, the responsibility is great, so may God help us bear it.
As they say, you are very qualified for this job.
She left, then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
She was far from him.
Forgot it.
I'm surprised to see him love it now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've done a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mama, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband's death, she said that I had envied him.
God forbid.
Yes, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, I've had enough of this.
What do you mean it's none of your business?
You just need to relax.
I cut them off because they made me anxious.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of my mother, for a mother will tell everyone.
She said, "Anything you hear, they call it a filter. We don't want a scandal."
What guarantees do you have that, if he is out of power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he is absent from the office, you will be the first candidate.
What assures you that they will fire him?
No, I'm very sure about that.
Don't mention it, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of you.
You will do magic for him.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
It's the burn and kick plan.
I'll make him attend every event in the country.
By that time, he will be burned out, and when he is burned out, he will resign. And when he resigns, he will be fired.
I swear, brother, I don't know how or what to say to you!
Your visit is called, it's called participation that reflects how much you love your country.
Do you believe that?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Sir, this is just a sheep, it's not your level. What do you think, sir, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am sick of fame, I am sick of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are social, make a prestigious place for yourself!
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
And today I bring him to a poetry evening and a wedding, and they have taken at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll also tell you about something nice to take to him.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it shines. I'm looking for that shine.
Sellers, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, a picture of your happiness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Excellency greets you.
A picture, a picture of him in this state. You are wide, wide, O my dignity.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to page two.
No, he doesn't know him.
This is a national contribution.
Say what God wills.
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a hurtful word.
The party where Abu Sultan kicked me out yesterday.
The winning performance for the young children in swimming.
Someone was telling his friend,
They thought I didn't hear them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my brother.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
Correct, correct.
You brought light when you came to this store, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's fine.
That means you won't go wandering around with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan hasn't come to go somewhere, I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the first row, then went to the vehicle to perform ablution.
We don't need anything from you, may God guide you.
Please, Mrs. God bless your parents, ask him. I will call you later to confirm.
And you're calling yourself.
People offer us discounts.
I told you.
This job is great.
But let this man come and take me!
His happiness annoyed me, so may God punish him.
Hello, Your Excellency the Minister.
No, but I'm a bit tired today and...
Great, if you're very excited, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and go with you, and I hope he can find you a party or something.
Then, a party?
No, no, we don't have any activity today.
No, we don't.
Alright, where can we find?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there someone I can ask?
God help you.
Sleep and rest.
One happy moment.
Anything for an easy night?
Yes, this is good.
There might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and look for a photographer to take pictures of his face.
Hello, hello, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a reserve league match. Let him be alone on the field!
What's this! This minister is turning the tables on us!
Beautiful, this means he reached the top.
His end is very near when he becomes the talk of the town.
Sir, I've become more popular than you.
Judge, if I go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with me.
Hello! Your happiness,
Shining star.
We will turn it off and restore it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break you. I'm not leaving.
Brock breaks their cameras, I have no desire for pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I've missed the train.
This is my brother Khalid.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Why?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see him!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
God.
Is this my immortality?
I haven't seen him for a long time, come to me, dear.
What should I do? He's so attached to her.
"No power or might except by Allah, you keep returning to the same topic."
Get out, get out and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Let me rest and don't make a big fuss about it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my dad, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
That means he was playing, playing.
Yes, he is playing, I told you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And as for this Saudi, I know what to do with him.
Poor eternity, I wish all children were like you.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he creates about his brother.
Come on, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we won't be going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to what I say.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
I'll let my aunt choose for herself.
But in reality, what do you think?
I say that the one overlooking the sea is better.
So in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we'll go straight from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please, you need to decide on the wedding date.
Well, it's just a year and a few months.
What's wrong with your brother, he's putting on too much perfume.
Frankly, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is quite different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, dear, everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know that there are perfumes not intended for a gender.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
It doesn't bother me.
I don't believe this, Khalid!
It's not the kind of perfume that women use.
So you can use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
In fact, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him, why don't you want to see his actions and behavior?
Perfumes are now gender-neutral.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
To get the result, you have to watch it and I'll tell you later.
Look how that girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one you say dances well and does some moves, do you know who she is? She's Mohammed's daughter, Mohammed's relative.
I have a cousin named Khaled.
Okay, you'll see what I'll do to him.
I'm waiting for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and see, let Saad come! I will send him the Bluetooth so that his family members can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Certainly, I was defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I will travel tomorrow.
You won't see him in this country.
Where are you going alone? (Idom), Where are you going alone? (Idom).
What will people say?
They will say their son left them and traveled, you don't want to cause a scandal for us!
Oh, really?
And what your son Khulud did is honor and glory!
A man who turns himself into a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people when they say he's gay.
Tell him that he traveled for medicine, or for study, or for work, or even for the sake of Islam.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
So, where are you going?
Nothing bothers me wherever I go (Idom).
This is the end.
The other one we don't know where he is, and he's here packing his bags to travel.
Even we don't know where he's going?
What did you expect him to be?
What's wrong with you? I'm coming to console you, and you're throwing harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't have any information about it and you were busy.
And the father is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What Khulood did has tarnished our reputation among people.
I don't see anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is my father's biggest mistake.
We are in the case of Khalid the gay man.
I didn't tell him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to be this clean, Amal.
Don't be surprised.
Khalud and his colleagues do not care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values call them
They dance and have fun.
In the wicked pit.
Oh, son, by God, I am in doubt.
Goodbye, Father.
Take care of yourself, son!
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the disc in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
Of course, Mother.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes.
He may go out.
Where is he going? He doesn't have enough time to go anywhere.
Answer me, what do you have, Abu Saad?
Father!
Aml, good!
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your morals,
But excuse me.
O God, grant me and grant you.
I see you're skimming the surface!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If someone has one dirham, they can get a thousand, oh my God! My dear.
Certainly I can handle it. God bless America, my love.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
1200
God is sufficient for you; every time you speak to a driver, you ask him how much his salary is?
My salary is too low.
When he sees you, he starts complaining, "My salary is low and there are no benefits." We reached an agreement with him that his salary would be seven hundred, and you increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, when you finish your year of work, we will raise your salary.
He seems greedy and we're going to have a tough time with him.
Enough, enough, shut your mouth, shut your mouth, shut your mouth, send it back and expel it.
Make this word easy for you, easy.
You won't let him complain, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
You've told me the story now, I'm the man of the house. Shut up, stop, shut up as well, I'll handle it.
Wake up, I want you outside, wake up!
Come and stand up.
What did I tell you?
I said not to let your friends come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Boss, this is not my friend, he is my uncle.
He will come for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in your mind!
Don't tell the lady I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everything in the world has become expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
Those drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
It might be thirteen hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll lift one hundred percent, shut up, I won't lift you.
You're not telling me you've been raised a hundred times more, go to work!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
No use in a hundred.
Two hundred dollars are of no use.
I'm afraid of screens.
Why are you afraid?
All drivers are fleeing.
Because they work outdoors for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, there's no benefit, but when you work outside the home, you earn more money.
Very afraid.
Look at them, they are all drivers.
How much?
2050
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and imprison me.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my cloak and about to go out.
I was calling and now someone is answering.
He opened his room and the closet was empty.
Muneera's maid ran away for a year.
I will only say, God is sufficient for him.
I'm coming to you.
I went to the police.
If you had reported, you wouldn't be held responsible.
We will do everything in our power.
And you too look around the neighborhood, you might see someone and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he gets bored, he will give up.
We bring them in, we pay for them, we clothe them, we feed them, we train them to drive.
It's not up to him.
The match is starting now, come in, entry is better.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily hunted.
Do you know that if more than three don't register, it means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear, this is clear sarcasm.
That's their level. If they can't score more than three, it's not the Fox team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
For them, nothing; they should thank God if they score less than three, they should thank God.
Any goal, these are the goals. Our team is still hungry, this is the Fox team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, so you're relieved and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals, or does it stop here?
This fox is very good, and very clever. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you will feel dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox said it's a big problem.
You won't be able to find him.
Yes, sir.
You don't know him, right?
He is a Fox team fan.
He sometimes appears on the show "Reorganize Yourself."
It's easy for them to win today and you will lose.
I swear I will defeat you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
Finished, the fox is the winner.
The birds came to take their livelihood and fly away.
In a way, let's be realistic, we're not saying the foxes won and flew away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
You didn't see what your honor did in the arena.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
A clear appearance on the field and thank you for listening.
The person who has a true love for the club and genuine loyalty to it.
Hangs out with the Qatari elite who go to shopping malls and such places.
He invited me to have a cappuccino.
What a strange world, man!
The boy gave me a hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us about the poem you wrote about our team's match against the Frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
You're not ashamed that your team is losing in front of you by four.
Talk shit about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The cause of that is the ruling.
A player was expelled from the Fox team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmak.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fan.
Excellent, and who have you chosen to honor this month?
The board member of the club will decide.
They are not children, and each one of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. Fox.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One speaks well, the other is silent.
What do you think, is it a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The audience left.
Follow him.
He turned here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Beautiful!
Shut your mouth, you don't decide. I'm the man of the house and I decide.
We have to be sure.
Majid Abdurrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the tribe of Al-Subah.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I assist you, gentlemen? What do you want?
Bless you.
Come in, residents, would you like some coffee?
You have nothing to say, praise be to God, you don't need anything, God may honor you.
You say I'm sure, is that good? Where are you going to embarrass us in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Mother, mother, I am a mother.
Now, what will your father do to us I don't know?
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Please, mother, don't tell father.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
He will surely kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't do it on purpose.
Mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What are the things we will adhere to, my son?
How can we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Mom, I'm afraid he's going to hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind!
You're blind to break the vessel, blind?
Mom, didn't Waleed come to you?
No, my daughter! He didn't come. What happened to you?
He fled from the house, fearing his father.
This is not true. Be compassionate towards the boy!
This is not upbringing, may God guide you, my daughter!
What do we do now, mother?
What should I do?!
I don't know, but I was afraid for him from the cars in the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is kind, good-hearted, and beloved, my daughter.
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from the devil and do not worry, we hope that everything will be alright.
Of course, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Walid?
My father is going to spank me.
Grandma, Dad is going to beat me to death.
Don't worry, my eye.
Don't worry, my love.
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Count, my son, count and drink a little water and sleep in my room.
Your face has turned yellow.
"O Allah, guide him, O Allah, guide him. Come with me, my son, a little."
O Generous One.
For fear that my father might come here.
Go, my son, don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I raise him the way I want.
But the poor buyer is anxious, trembling, and terrified of something he never intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Look at him!
The basket accidentally knocked over the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to do it.
You! You must support him!
Please, don't say anything to him. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He is not here.
He is here! Where?
Enter, go!
No, no, I'll bring it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than the old!
Eagles, come on, brother, we want to play!
And your mother says you're studying!
We will study, except for this game!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Hey dad, go ahead and don't spoil the game.
Go, father, come on, don't take it seriously. Go, go, father, we'll study.
What are you saying! Listen to me.
If you don't come, your uncle Abu Walid will call you.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
It doesn't bother me.
I'll tell him you don't obey me.
Go. Everyone takes their book and starts studying.
Of course, Daddy, put your phone in your pocket. We'll study, Daddy, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really very confused. I don't know what to do?
I'm afraid that if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course he'll ask me, why are you taking him to the hospital?
So what's the problem if I tell him?
If he knew that Waleed was wetting the bed, he would kill him.
Oh! Mom, it's him who's wrong. It's all his fault.
Oh! My daughter, it's psychological.
The boy is not a child anymore, he is now twelve years old.
Oh! My daughter, it's okay.
You will come to have lunch with us and I will give him some signals.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
It's just an excuse (term), my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he wets the bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He told me that I should take him to the hospital so they could treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
And he doesn't understand anything.
He is right.
They have to take him to the hospital, son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
And he may look for a good dry trunk.
He beat him until his screams could be heard by the last person in the neighborhood.
Sit!
Eat, my daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and have a shower, I'll get you some clothes. Go!
Please, if you please.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
Would you call that a pass?
Khulood got ninety-four out of fifty.
Is this success?
But their grades are good.
He told them that you will be punished if you don't get fifty out of fifty.
Please don't take them to your brother!
They shall be punished.
They are my children.
Certainly, I swear uncle, uncle, this is the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. You are not allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop it, Uncle, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, I'm about to die, stop, Uncle.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, what you will see at the end of the year, if none of you get fifty.
I will empty the swimming pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it would be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdulrahman.
Good oh! Khalid, well done.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent, Faisal.
Bless you.
You are an outstanding student and were second in your class.
Teacher, he's crying because he got 49 out of 50 in math.
Teacher, he is afraid of his father because he wants him to get a perfect score.
My son, I am speaking to you!
Call, call his brother in class.
He told me that he saw me by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's house.
No, he didn't go there.
So where is he? So where is he?
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
What's wrong, brother?
Ah, of course he failed and is afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, rather he was an excellent student and was second in his class.
But he was afraid to go home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
He may rest in peace.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
"By God! Here is Waleed."
Eighty-four, ninety-four, you've lost a mark or two, never mind. I won't say anything, I won't scold or beat you. Walid.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
Saudi Arabia ranks first with 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States of America, and Nigeria.
With three percent each, and the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent.
That's why.
And production.
And this may be one of the secrets and reasons behind the desire of major industrialized countries to occupy this region and its countries.
At the top of these countries is the United States of America, which is the world's largest consumer of oil.
But oil prices are on the rise.
Simultaneously with the decline of the US dollar

This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To increase inflation therein
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.

In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And for viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable Deputy, welcome and greetings.
I want to start with you about the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where prices might go
Of course, the nagging question is how high prices might go.
Or what we call market power.
Isn't it OPEC?
And the producing countries?
And apart from producing countries, the organization has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, there is not much correlation between supply and demand in this regard.
What are factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
That made investors
I felt a lot of pressure and turned to oil and gold, or what is called "commodities trading."
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And he also went.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in past years to $970 now.
And today, as mentioned before, one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be only a slight decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter, which should see a drop in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a strange and changing mood.
In the second quarter and the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices for the winter season and consumption have now changed and become other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in it.
On Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation in light of the political complexities
Which was accompanied and today led most activities of American newspapers and world press. This could affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today anything.
Today, we are in the age of globalization and influence comes swiftly.
Irreal factors might influence
And created a kind of disruption in the market.
Also created some types of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, there is nothing confirmed that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
We may not see what will happen in the future.
But it's us who work in the energy sector.
We see that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
In return, there are very profitable supplies.
This shows that oil is being conserved.
And no reduction in petroleum supplies whatsoever.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
In light of this confirmed picture you're presenting about supply, and that there are no obstacles in the supply chain.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will rise to special figures.
The price may reach
Global oil reserves
You are here, today, the gulf represents great importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, and that is certain.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates.
This means that in the event of any war with Iran, there will be no guarantee of how high oil prices will rise.
God knows the day may come, we arrived without.
Wars to one hundred and twenty-seven dollars and may jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is under political and psychological pressures.
Speculators have taken advantage of these tensions.
Just invest in oil.
Or what is called no real investment of course, neither future buying nor future marketing.
And it is called oiled paper.
And they are all guesses in the oil paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
This could lead to buying more products instead of upgrading.
I want April to be April Fools' Month.
I hope there isn't one.
It is said that Cheney will come to the region, and this is his main agenda.
China is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I didn't know what was inside the Chinese bag.
And I can't predict what will be in it, you know.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens, if we talk about April, April is coming soon after a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world may pay.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't roll this number.
The cost of their production is very cheap.
In comparison with West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
We have been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
Until the end, do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a close circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said: "It's strange that you speak among us in closed doors."
It's not the same way you speak in front of others.
The media said: "For political reasons."
And of course, there is what is called double standards or double speak.
The language you know is Arabic, and the countries of the Gulf are known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And to enter into it.
Despite all this
The leader of the central region.
Start a war with Iran.
Even with an air war or air raid, as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, in fact, you're very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
Because we don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
I mean, non-renewable energy.
For the good (between parentheses) of generosity
Arab generosity
Go and give it to me.
Observers say that the real price of oil
The cause of the rise in oil prices
You are Gulf citizens, OPEC countries, and states.
You are very generous to Americans, and you insist on clinging to their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the drop in the U.S. dollar is sixty to seventy.
ok now the price is one hundred
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and the rate
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This comparison
Those are oil prices.
Because the United States of America
Of course it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to drop.
A weakness or recession in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You too become like that.
The United States is reducing benefits on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about the reason for linking the price of oil to the dollar.
The first who, more than 100 years
The first one to export the first barrel of oil was the United States of America.
And they were exported in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
That was a hundred years ago when the world was assessing and pricing.
Which puts Norway today as the third-largest oil-producing country.
And oil export.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
The price is in dollars, not in...
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information pointing to something other than this.
You are the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
You have secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and there is nothing else.
And these agreements
It stands if oil remains a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to support these regimes.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's talk about OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent, esteemed deputy.
From thirteen countries.
Out of fifty-eight barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are many countries that are huge in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles preventing pricing in another currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
This is not when adults decide.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states are the stars of the Middle East.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
There are sixty percent.
And assuming that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and intentions towards change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What impact?
Let me now speak about the European reason.
Do not export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or roubles
Because it is in their interest, their currency is high and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where his loss lies.
With one euro they export one and a half barrels.
No, you are the one losing out because your currency has depreciated since it was pegged to the dollar.
And he is also a big loser, a great loss.
The monetary union here in the Gulf has a historical bond.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And they are now linked when you talk about withdrawal.
Like marriage when we have sex.
And you want a divorce, which is not easy.
No, here.
Or you entered into a Catholic marriage for a fee.
And costs must be examined in a way
It was inspected professionally and examined thoroughly.
And this is similar to Kuwait, which has dismantled 25% of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar
He may adjust his currency rate.
Today about the topic, but that doesn't mean you don't want to study the topic or think about it.
The inspection, of course, varies as stated by the excellent Prime Minister.
It was mentioned that the Qatari currency is undervalued by 30%.
In this research
There's no direction in which you are the only ones going with this topic.
Similarly, Kuwait went its own way, so why don't you follow in its footsteps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And that's another thing.
These four Gulf states announce
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support it personally.
He will support her.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What he achieved was from one or two countries.
And until the time of the currency's appearance
Therefore, you won't succeed in saving the situation now.
Of course, there are experts who will conduct this study.
They will be the ones to do that.
This is not a matter of expertise; it requires a political decision.
We wait and bide our time to see what happens today.
People started..., I mean
Of course, in a position of complicity
Mr. Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 has now reached 14% and will reach 15% this year.
He ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Salaries for residents in Qatar have decreased by 35 to 40 percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the size of the pay increases that will be made.
For employees in Qatar at least for the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
Minister of Industry Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah on the dramatic rise in prices
In oil, which brought back tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries.
About oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has 97.8 billion barrels of proven reserves and produces 2.6 million barrels per day.
The ton only and a report on Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are one of the largest.
Saudi Arabia expected revenues in 2008 of $109 billion.
And that was it.
Last year, 170 in the UAE, 66 this year, and it was expected to be 75.
Kuwait had forty-six, and its number was forty-five.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's a gas, as other reports have said, and God willing, no envy, I mean we don't envy the excellent deputy.
Iraq is 47 billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries export one trillion dollars.
There was a group of imports worth a dollar.
Investment from the United States was three hundred billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5% but it will increase to 7%, and in Qatar, it was 13.5% but it will increase to 15%.
That means those living in Qatar will expect a rise in the cost of living, from goods to prices.
Life is consumed, prices rise, and reach higher and higher rates in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then there must be the ring.
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
This means you will increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they'll say you're against raising salaries.
Likewise, it is not true.
And in the cabinet, against raising salaries.
That there is a problem and solutions must be ideal.
And other inappropriate solutions.
There is a balance between them.
And that's it.
The important thing is to solve inflation.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
That His Highness issued to form
And He places.
And laid a strong foundation.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing now is to control inflation.
Contraction
If you weren't controlling it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
Specialized in market research and published last February, just days ago.
Due to the salaries among them.
Now you're going to solve inflation and let inflation eat away at those people's income.
Many of them now
Income into other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve inflation and lower them again.
I repeat what they say, which is to balance the subject.
But now
And there is no temporary solution.
Hit it harder.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation
Boredom will always exist.
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, right?
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not the same as those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
Now the question of increase must also be looked at fairly.
I don't know where I got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellency, not in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
That is the most
Among the Qataris who were working in government offices, some have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Facing a problem
To turn to the private sector because the private sector is more vibrant and dynamic.
And it offers good salaries.
Attached to what is called market power.
Or market power.
They won't come with very high qualifications.
Because they don't come to Qatar due to low salaries or low expenses.
Or with the expenses that come with it.
Agreeing with our clear understanding
I am not predicting events, and I am not saying that there will be a raise in salaries.
No hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
Control inflation
And by the will of God, this is what the report said, that Qatar in the year two thousand and ninety-one.
God willing, we say that.
We see that these numbers will change.
Sprinkle some on the people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything.
Deflation
Because spending
Much in different projects
Allow me to take some questions from the audience, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Based on the ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is the difference in OPEC's organization.
The second total oil revenue goes directly to the governor.
Then to the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
The absence of accountability will keep the situation as it is.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
I won't belabor the point, the brother mentioned the issue of governing systems and the question of linking the Qatari riyal to the dollar or other Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to make the world global and have it swear allegiance to her.
U.S.-China trade hit $28 billion.
In addition, the European Union is worth $68 billion.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and oil-producing Gulf states.
It will end with a confrontation between America.
And among the advanced countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, and the issue may become
Pure military nature
The explosion of China's bombs, Russia's bombs, Japan's bombs, and America's bombs as well.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question is to Mohammed.
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Yes, your question is...
But from what I saw, his happiness continued to go unanswered.
He has nothing to do with the dollar because it's declining.
And with God's permission, he will reach the bottom.
And he is a good man.
He will not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, brother Mohammed. Thank you. Now we have one last intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for the great interview.
What is required, an increase in salary, God willing, things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Salaries, God willing, are fine.
Tell me your question quickly.
Do you have a question? Your line will be disconnected.
It's all due to high prices; the increase has affected all goods, and they are all exported.
I am from European countries.
We have factories and laboratories in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you for taking the time.
The current state of price hikes is a significant one.
"The case of supporting the poor, the man told you to stay with the poor for your happiness."
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
This is not true for the State of Qatar.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
Within the framework of reactions
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in a way that is neither genuine nor realistic.
The person who does not see with his own eye.
If he comes and sees Qatar and the massive developments taking place there.
As a high-growth candidate, you're right, you ask.
And every person has the right.
And since you live in a small country, where will you bring the people from?
Does that really mean you'll bring the surplus from China, for example?
But we will not export, God willing.
The state is built on a plan and ...
The ideal independence of the amount of money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
The question is whether the State of Qatar will become
This achievement is considered one of the best in the Arab world.
Today as well
The focus is on
Which will have a great impact.
After oil and gas
Therefore, you're not copying Dubai.
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where people come to receive treatment.
There will be a media city that adapts.
Of course, today's world, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we were not prepared for this surge, as it took us by surprise.
We were unprepared for it, whether in terms of human resources, technology, or even education.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And better than that
Today there is a vision.
"And vision"
And the vision
Thank you, Mr. Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
Hoping we've provided you with a helpful follow-up.
Qatar's foreign policy appears unclear to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special ties.
And at the same time, Qatar had relations with Israel and still does.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
Qatar has provided
It began.
The largest Arab country
That angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Similarly, Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Israeli prisoners.
Gilaad Shalit, the Qatari foreign policy hand was extended towards him in a way that stirred the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power do you put in such a situation?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or contact us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Honor.
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit has been different in the relationship between the two countries at least in the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the Hijaz newspaper or magazine.
The agreement made with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which relations were restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was very long and needed a lot of answers without your last question.
I believe you gave it to her.
Especially regarding the Saudi matter.
What is precise?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is of great importance to the State of Qatar.
Between the two countries
You spoke about the silence of the island.
A revolutionary movement
I believe these matters have been clarified from both sides.
We have accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
It was always limited in scope.
A point of view.
And thanks to God, it was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years have passed.
Our relationship was bright, respectful, and trustworthy.
I want to clarify the misunderstanding between two parties.
This matter was dealt with and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It's not a seasonal relationship, but a strategic one.
We want it not to continue but to evolve.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to diplomatic speech, or I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia is therefore not diplomatic but I believe
The topic Al Jazeera is talking about is below the radar of the media.
Between the parties and many countries participated in the mediation.
An idea that he might take points against the points of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
For harmony within the Gulf house.
I mean in contrast to what came before.
As part of a political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement, only an agreement of love and care.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
Can we say it in one, two, three, and four?
And there must be unity.
Some disputes were settled accordingly.
Between some Arab countries and attempting to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain case, and another country has a different opinion.
Two points of view are considered.
Some observers believe that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
To denounce him.
I was tired and decided to head in a different direction, and from there I moved to a bigger country, Egypt.
That's the same idea.
No, no, we're not enjoying this and we don't have anything to do.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean that the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
Between them and me, I know there's a very big misunderstanding.
And you know that we have created.
And there will be some kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
I started disputing with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram's 18th edition last April.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In a comprehensive inquiry, it was stated that the extensive investigations have been completed.
In the Hezbollah network, a sabotage plot was revealed.
Includes three countries targeting Egypt, namely Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
She is a well-known media whistle-blower for her role in exposing conspiracies.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Plot against Egypt
We respect.
And its struggle over the years
What I said wasn't meant to emotionally manipulate anyone.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And who is eager?
On Arab relations
The first point
Gaza Issue
As they say and as we acknowledge.
Qatar is
A smaller-sized state
which can be part of such schemes
Because we have suffered from interventions by other countries at some point, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I'm trying to say is that a house with a God can protect itself, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
If Egypt stabilizes
And why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids do not bring things into existence from nothing.
He said that the small state of Qatar attempted to undermine Egypt's role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
And you were seeking to hold a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And that you use Media Horn, which is Al Jazeera channel.
Yes, go on.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable with that.
But I can say that we are certain.
That we have
Our principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
Our brothers in Egypt were forced to do so, and we blame the Egyptian authorities for it.
The conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm going to do that.
Sweet-smelling days of peace and the peace cause that we are
Previously held in Egypt.
And after that, with us.
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with him.
I am not in disagreement with Idrail.
And now, because of the conference, since that day.
Every Islamic conference, every Arab conference has sensitivity.
This sensitivity
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this sensitivity
Or three
Gaza Conference that was held
Egypt does not want it to be held in Qatar.
It's not Arabic.
In Qatar, and that there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them that.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we hold it before any organized conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and...
Postponement
The dispute began.
There cannot be a small state.
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also a crime for Egypt, not for anyone else.
When they said that afterwards.
You are on the island.
The Israelis had reported a day earlier that there was a meeting to cease hostilities before any speech or anyone or anything.
What is it?
My brother allowed medicine and food to be brought in during the beating that our brothers had to endure.
When did they say the gate was narrow?
I cannot allow trucks to enter.
When they tell us there's a deal on the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the time we want to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
Neither Fatah nor Hamas represent me. The only ones who represent me are the one and a half million who are suffering.
They are the ones who have no medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
And if Qatar intervenes in the matter, it will affect the Egyptian regime.
It's not an intervention.
We didn't say how Egypt would resolve the situation because that's up to them.
One of the officials said: "We have uncovered a big plot like this."
He hasn't yet told us what the scenario is.
We mean this official.
He tells us that Egypt is very big.
Okay, we realize that Egypt is a large Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a great nation.
That's why we always ask a great nation for many things.
Because Egypt is ours.
You were invited to a conference where they were provoked.
We weren't invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and took a unified stance.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know Turkey introduced things through Israel.
I would be happy to see her pass through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does a good political act.
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the entire Arab world.
Settling in Egypt is very important to us.
If he has done a good job, that is important to us.
Let me finish your question, your presentation took a quarter of an hour.
Now you've lost me because of you.
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now about anger.
Upon you are the officials of the Egyptian system.
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed at the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a vision he wanted to achieve.
And he wanted to seek reconciliation.
That's why some countries were not allowed to attend.
I have said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
There is no disagreement with Saudi Arabia even on this point.
Because, as explained, there is an internal problem.
Or an official
Top-ranking officials
A large country where an official finds a small country doing such things.
That means you had one.
To take any role
Darfur is part of Egypt's and Sudan's national security.
The five major countries decided.
Any country other than Qatar would be fine.
But these sensitivities will only exacerbate the situation. Why do you have to insert your noise into everything around you?
We want to address this allergy by taking an antihistamine, they need to tell us what the allergy is.
Why sensitivities?
Some brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza Revolution.
As if you're saying what the English say, "Blame the Italians."
When did something happen?
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The case must be resolved locally.
Unsolved
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then see if I have enough time.
And research into the causes that concern my Arab nation.
"Or Qatar tried to reconcile."
And thinking about any Arab issue where she can contribute as much as she can.
Why is it provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can choose not to fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
And from our perspective
That sprang from his heart
Let me finish.
When he announced the reconciliation initiative and all the presidents were gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good and welcomed it.
There are dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, I believe, or a TV interview or something, I won't respond to that.
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests
That is in response to the call referred to by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can offer as advice to him and others is
They are trying to rectify their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we all have our own mistakes in politics and economics, so no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Are you denying the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To obscure Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and disrupt its connections with Turkey and the European Union.
First and foremost, we are a small minority.
If we can pull this off.
This is not true.
There are some charges against you personally.
To pay money to Shalit's captives so that Qatar takes over Shalit and surpasses the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, firstly we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about giving money.
But this issue
We support Egypt to solve the same problem as we support Egypt and still do to solve the issue between the Palestinians.
It is he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and for the Palestinian institutions to remain until the conflict is resolved.
And we have said that.
At the Arab League, but he said no, it happened because we believe that some people don't want that.
But we made her speak intelligently.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
I really don't know if there's a problem.
I don't know from us or from them.
They decided now in the twelfth issue in last April exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper.
Because the political leadership in Egypt decided to launch a satellite news channel to confront the Al Jazeera Media Network's Al Jazeera channel and put an end to it.
It's a matter of days and everything will be over.
I fear the island may become a thing of the past.
We are now living in a political adolescence.
I also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not negotiate with them, and they did not negotiate with us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small state yields to a large state, Egypt.
There is one important point we need to clarify about Saudi Arabia.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we speak.
Okay, how about the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
And we rely on him a lot.
Let me be honest with you.
Or is it a dispute in core politics?
I hope this is not a personal dispute because we have no personal dispute. I have told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you would say there are two problems: Gaza and what else?
This incident has affected all of us greatly.
We want to solve this from a psychological perspective, meaning to resolve this impasse.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We discussed everything.
But it's clear that things got worse and weren't resolved.
No, no, there was listening.
I cannot tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They criticize us, and they have the right to do so as our brothers.
And indeed we blame them as our younger brothers.
With the big country, we don't want to break up with any big country.
I mean that Egypt is too big for contentment.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution will come from heaven.
For us if there is anyone waiting for satisfaction
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with neither nobility nor brotherhood.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if there is someone misleading another person.
I know Israel does this to us.
The previous American policy under the previous administration was also either with me or against me.
Therefore, I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
And if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We realize and know that there are some orders even for a great state.
What controls your policies?
We have no will of our own; what moves us is one thing.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal affairs.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will do so.
Sources of power: Island and continental position are the basis.
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Prince
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me handle this, we don't want to cause any trouble for anyone.
And we do not want to compete with anyone.
They can say what they want about great Qatar or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First and foremost, we shut down and severed ties with the Israeli office.
First they said close the office so we closed it, then they got angry and went to complain to the Americans, do you believe these people?
Join the team called the Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans, Europeans, and my friends, we know how to deal with them.
Malignant plans
that were conducted
This is a flaw. We've reached a certain point, and then what?
Now tell me.
In points, how will you solve the problem with Egypt?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it is important to consider that.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen about that.
But some of the crew
We need to go out.
Occupation of the Egyptian public opinion or government leadership or otherwise or illogical leadership.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how that would happen.
And I know that there is a time for meaning.
And there may come a time from us.
If it were from me.
Or among them
Major Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will find this issue.
Life means it still goes on beyond that.
That means we respond in the same Egyptian way you have.
If someone extends a helping hand to us, we will offer them an arm.
Your happiness now, Sheikh.
We weren't used to running.
Unless we are well prepared, we are not ready to race for Egypt.
Stand with Egypt.
There are many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they are affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptian workers either in universities or key positions.
You know that in this matter we are not accustomed to cancelling jobs and cancelling.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where demands have changed, they are canceling one demand and bringing in another.
It's supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
ok Quick answer
The office was there.
We've disturbed the office, so it's best we leave now.
We were putting pressure on them during their campaign days, we all lost out in negotiations with Israel because of this office.
That's why we closed it. Let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And they were among us, as it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state.
So there was no formal invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when relations, as they say, were good. We will honor her now; it's a bit difficult.
There's no reason for you to reopen the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no other reasons.
You have achieved great success.
What made it as big as Egypt.
Egypt imposed this.
Let me clarify, our relationship with America is strategic.
In some things, and that is it.
What is the most important thing?
There are things in our region in solving some cases where we had a dispute with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
The serious step in advancing the peace process and the serious step in resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran and what could be its impact on the Gulf and on you.
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Some of them with each other.
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they'll get through this crisis.
Iran's stability is as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
We have intervened every time a party wanted to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
And Lebanese groups
About how to see
You have no role in Yemen or they have just taken a stance.
Listen, it is known that we supported unity when most of the Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
We have spoken with Yemen from the south, and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet the Yemeni President.
I explained to him that our goal is the stabilization of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And they did not respect this agreement, and I do not want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Did Qatar take this position and then was accused of paying money to Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't get involved in such matters.
He who performs the act of unity does not stand upon it.
Another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
We feel uncomfortable, but believe me, I was shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time has run out, but briefly tell me about these problems that occurred to you due to your efforts to solve problems. Will you change your policies regarding intervention in other Arab problems?
If His Highness had listened to me, I think there would be no need.
There was once a great show.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we invested it, it would be fifty billion dollars. Better than a headache.
But I say it with faith, because the time in the Arab world now is perhaps.
It is not allowed under these circumstances.
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
Perhaps even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
What happened to the agreement in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To authorize the committee and provide it with all the support
Studying Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, we were able to make a slightly balanced decision.
We sought in Doha to have both parties enthusiastic.
We tried our best not to hear it, or there wouldn't be.
Because we knew the committee that we knew.
The earthly reality, and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was resolve.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly reflects on it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to be in this location.
On these terms.
And unfortunately
Externalities
I can say that the problem among Lebanese, even if there is a problem, won't be the first problem.
Okay, Sheikh's country, I know that the time might not be now, perhaps it's too early to talk about the scenes, but
What happened when I came here?
Stop talking about the engagement on Earth for now.
You didn't delay a single moment.
I know exactly what was happening, even the leaders of Lebanon were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him if we went to Lebanon.
I will present the idea that His Highness approved and supported.
Where all the Lebanese leaders will be present.
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each of their territories.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
That's why we created this atmosphere, but our idea from the start was
And this was the most important decision they both had made.
Certainly
And I felt that from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I think this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
To achieve a honorable solution for both parties.
And that there will be a solution and no one will lose.
Before you make any move
The consultation was held at the Arab League and we found support.
What we did
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
He recommended him to me.
To prevent them from moving and to take their mobile phones away from them.
We were able to bring them there and also support our brothers in Syria in the situation.
I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can do nothing.
Why did they want a solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred.
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia, and there is tension in Sudan.
There are many things happening in the world.
And every time we put out the fire.
It is in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign intervention.
And we strive hard to make it better.
Sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point that needs to be discussed.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanon issue is...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
I need a self-review in the Arab world.
Because of Arabic differences.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
We tried that.
In thirty-seven wars
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem.
I think it's beneficial.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Seize wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our backyard.
"And We are not going to punish them."
And how can we stop playing in the courtyards of Arab countries?
As Arabs, at least the minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
And while we look
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
Arab states
Betrayal is not so much a what as a kind of how.
Jealousy is what word?
This is a situation that needs everyone's support, I mean, I think.
Okay, will you fulfill this wish and actually call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
Came in the middle of the conversation.
Is it possible for us to play a role in resolving the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
We are eager to find solutions, and I am sure of their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them, often.
There was consensus in politics, and I am sure of that, God willing.
To improve relations.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't say for certain that this is what's happening now.
I am sure if Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the existence of a general Arab awakening call.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
That can be interpreted on the ground as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation and perhaps other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can't only deliver food and medicine.
And the electricity supply for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness the Amir is always there.
There are more than one and a half million Palestinians under siege.
And we do not want them to have any weapons or support.
They do all this.
And the lack of electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we only provide them with food and medicine.
Our disagreement with them may continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
Leave illusions behind.
The current Palestinian dispute is a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit.
This is a dangerous matter, they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask to go again to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
And this disagreement was resolved.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I want there to be a solution, but
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a part of it and we will not accept being a part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iran for cooperation and peaceful neighborhood
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign
No, never.
Okay, I'll go back to the Lebanese file if that's good.
Honestly, your honor, we faced a big obstacle, but we reached a solution in the last hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
Information may be scattered and unrelated, but that's what happened.
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I wonder if it has specific dates set before.
So you knew there were negotiations.
We're continuing to find a solution.
Undoubtedly, the support of the Kingdom is very important.
And change negotiation tactics.
These negotiations were led by
To a positive outcome; we gathered some parties from some sides.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this research.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
We started talking about the subjects one by one.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
This obstacle was removed.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
You're not considering your role right now.
Listen, the most important thing is to stay out of the spotlight.
You have no territorial ambitions.
Or even control another state or something because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our fellow colleagues.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
They have countries that are.
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Allow some small countries to take on this role and support them.
In some things, excellent; in others, good; and in some things, less than good.
Your last question, sir.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
"Security or Reforming Hostility"
or confront Israel
Let's stop playing in the Arab square.
We fix what's wrong in the Arab countries, our problems.
Selecting an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
Nationally and regionally
But if we are rigid
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the war on Gaza.
We start by requesting a meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
As if you'd changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, my brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Confronting our brothers in Gaza
It contains clauses that require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not boycott the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before that.
Not only by a Security Council resolution but also through
They are not exposed to error or contempt.
Let me put it in another sentence.
And we are disciplined.
The street can no longer tolerate it, if we as responsible for the Arab street indulge it.
It will not be tolerated.
When we were in Egypt
There were between ten and eleven written approvals.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
We retain it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I do not blame them if they have an opinion about the meeting.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important subject.
Because our goal is not advertising, but finding.
Therefore, the summit was not neglected.
We ask ourselves too.
We will go to press the other poor side.
The previous, the successive, and the Security Council resolution, but let's just stick to the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may call for an Arab summit with whoever attends it.
We found that the majority of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by "moderate."
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia, in Latin America.
Unsolved
Classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Will he abandon the Palestinian cause?
Because we don't just love them.
We influence Palestinian affairs in some way.
No country allows interference, whether good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and perhaps another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is this the question?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it was intended for us to engage in an internal Arab fight.
Okay, let's go to the Security Council.
There is no solution in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel finishes his mission
The second Arab ministerial meeting to which you were invited.
which was dominated by debates, disagreements, and intense quarrels
There is an important point.
This is not important.
When we call for a meeting
About stations
No more peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there is a party that tells you we must wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
and freezing peace negotiations with Israel
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose in this.
There is a greater loss than the one we have suffered now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that arguments are not important.
There was someone who wished for the destruction of Hamas and something like that to happen.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to talk about others.
It is important to be men to ourselves and men to our state.
We make the policies of our countries.
Who does these things on his behalf.
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, are there people doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't blame anyone, I don't want to blame anyone for this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will her agenda be?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the problem here is if Israel implements the decision immediately.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I know for a fact that there are difficulties.
The question has not been raised by the international community, and if it were,
He will be shy.
The situation
Look, they did something to the Jew and the Israeli.
To claim their rights
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs don't go to the Security Council.
They agreed to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And Western societies will try for us.
Because we are in the Arab world and there are a lot of people, and you can see how the Arab street is reacting to this.
But this decision is important.
With the case of our bosses being summoned one after another.
In the end, they said there was nothing and that he was lying.
Okay, if we were like Germany or otherwise, would we demand?
They won't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who carried out the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
And the execution of hundreds of thousands.
Because you're a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, one another.
I worked hard on how to
To display it.
So it seemed as if it were a decree and the deed of God.
If the Arab nation says if they send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur.
Arabs considered or some considered the decision 1860.
Our colleagues worked hard to draft the resolution.
issued by the Security Council
What I want to say is that it wasn't a victory or it wasn't.
And what will lead to
Let's assume that victory
What we'll do
We're not supposed to combine this with the rest of the decision.
But I assure you that we will implement the decision.
Unfortunately, you will comply with the decision even if you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
This means that we are
Do you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't believe in the Arab nation.
At the same time, ready for any alternatives.
And I do not think that the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group surpass the other in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start trying to make plans.
When they held a meeting, I don't know if it was the European Arab intelligence or something like that without mentioning names.
And once they did that, I mean we participated.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be sorting in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The next stage because the Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I will talk about the subject two years ago but in the matter of the decision accurately.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Issued but not enforced.
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
Everyone was required to have one viewpoint.
It's not necessary for everyone to agree on one point of view, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
What has been happening in Gaza for two years and you said political parties.
Preferring one group over another that participated in the siege of Gaza
You really do agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been issued from here and there.
Conspire an Arab plot amidst all that's happening in Gaza now.
We are partially aware.
On the subject, let me tell you that we are not fully aware.
But I know.
Concerning the Palestinian conflict
It was funded at the Arab and international levels.
If it's not charged, it won't make much difference.
And that was after the elections.
Hamas came and took power.
By a majority
We should have given them a chance and seen.
Reform or they are still revolutionaries who know only weapons and fighting.
But on the day they came
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some say there is an assault now.
Made by Hamas who broke the truce or those Palestinians from Gaza who broke the truce
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza have been suffering from hunger for two years.
This is good.
For reasons of Israeli security
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
And then who should decide?
This or that, not every country has the sovereignty to choose.
Our government
The main reason for the problem.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we were working hard, we were working hard to ignite the conflict.
But it's clear that we were asked to let one team defeat the other because that team...
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
Everything that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party that they would give them a proper life.
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, according to what you said you had.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And here is the Egyptian initiative, the one that...
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Those Egyptian efforts
Certainly, that's not the trick.
This is required for an important role.
Egypt's borders are also adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
We translate
And that we will not stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, and we bring people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
There must be.
And therefore, we always ask them to play a big role.
What was announced.
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give the possibility of success or study.
I think his chances of success are great.
If the brothers in Egypt...
Making Palestinian perspectives more similar.
It is the party harmed in Gaza that should discuss the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1800 was adopted
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem we face.
We won't hear any side.
But I really wanted it, when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the league, they asked to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is important.
We do not allow authority.
To be our goal, not to build our policy
To stay in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't gone through its materials.
Do you believe, in principle, that this could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860 as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now, there is neither tomorrow nor the day after, because
Every day that passes
There will be bloodshed for our brethren there.
That's why we don't want to delay or the Israelis delay on this matter. When they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are cautious about it.
I want to clarify everything you said.
Now we have to solve the problem.
And not in the way Israel wants it to be.
I've been drawn to the Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express that?
Arab vacuum
It is, without a doubt, a distinguished position.
And of Arab depth
Introduction to Disability in Arabic
We know there is an Arab disability.
Due to the conflicts that were part of it.
Partly because of everyone's perspective, they all believe his perspective is the optimal one.
And another person believes that his viewpoint is better.
And how can you allow people to respect you when they know there is an Arab decision?
Or they will chase us one by one.
The last will deny it and say that everything is fine, we will simply give them two or three more days so that we can contact them and bring them up to speed and solve the problem.
We have to rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may make mistakes, but we will address them.
At the Arab level
But now
At least we tell them no.
Within the framework of the desired Qatar site, positions such as, we will return to this point in a moment.
Also in the field at the same time I heard.
Khaled Meshaal was the head of the Political Bureau of Hamas.
Firstly, everything Brother Khalid Meshaal said was unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't you sit with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
We'll go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions Israel also imposes conditions
Let them impose conditions, aren't they allowed to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
We must not listen to this people when they tell me that de Gaulle did not listen.
Completely different, first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
With or without allies, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
Now what we're talking about
Is this the Arab gift we are supposed to receive?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
which can be fulfilled from these classes that you request
Many of those criticizing Qatar in this case are also demanding
What happens to the actor while the office is still open?
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
To cut ties, all connections, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They only want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We translate
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, in this one and in more difficult decisions.
More than this decision.
We need a unified Arab stance.
For others
So that neither party sells the other for moral, material, or similar gains.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
The good people are a different matter, they have disagreements with the United States.
Our people do not need us to remind them.
Five permanent member ambassadors and their arguments are these films.
That which we have finished, the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, Your Highness, Sheikh.
Or demanding that Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if it's put into one Arab frame, it might succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor do we encourage"
How can we bring Syria, Lebanon, and other countries together when there are Arab states that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy now among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if she returned her lands.
The situation in Gaza will be different, they are still
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Nature differs.
Yes, I mean here the goals of Israel, that is, the goals of the operation for Israel.
One day someone hits, one day someone punishes, and one day someone pleases.
For them, what happened in Lebanon is not a good example.
The solution is the sample that became in Lebanon.
He considers it good.
Gaza
Listen to the problem in Gaza or Palestine, its solution is easier than in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their disputes are about power.
On the distribution of power.
That differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
Beyond the Lebanese thought.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And here is the problem.
Venerable Sheikh
We only have two minutes, but if you solve the problem to some extent.
And diplomatic responsibility
How can this process end?
Palestinians in Gaza
I want to tell you.
Or reject
And help
That didn't work out for us.
It will be an Arab failure.
Regarding the strategy
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Why not before now?
The problem is not a matter of initiative as much as we feel.
We will help whoever solves the problem, without mentioning Qatar's name because some people have issues with mentioning Qatar.
No preparations for a summit, as there is already a summit scheduled for March.
If we had taken the initiative, we would have been better than our brothers, I don't think so.
And not pressuring them.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
We went through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and we ask our Arab brothers to help as much as they can in this matter.
And we hope to push her out of the competition.
Arab Championship
In heating up due to its dispute with the Sudanese government at the time.
And these are our problems, yes, we fight each other and disagree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait, in the following month, the nineteenth, I believe of course the Arab situation.
As you know, Your Excellency mentioned and explained it.
Does the entire Arab climate facilitate it? Is it the first economic summit?
Lord Prince
And of course, we attend any summit held in a sister state.
And we are not against attending any summit.
But not afraid to become a political summit.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if that means ten days from now.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they were beaten for twenty-five days?
It will be
They won't say that Arabs can't meet.
They said we said that.
They said we said that.
With all due respect, this summit has been programmed and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own way
That's why.
And go in peace.
And if you say it like that, it will be guaranteed.
For the mentioned meeting.
Thank you, our audience, for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a special bill.
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He also delivered more than seventy lectures, workshop papers, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
To refer to people with disabilities, should we say "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities" as you mentioned?
Good evening.
Taken from a human rights perspective or culture of human rights because persons with disabilities
Because he deals with disabled people and considers them people first.
Human
And then it resulted in his disability in trying to adapt to society.
The medical concept was dominant at that time.
Towards a Concept
Pedagogy and special education emerged.
This category became
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
Which are the normative rules derived from?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And accelerated the pace until the emergence of the international convention, which was legally binding and distinguished the rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this statement.
This article treats these people as human beings and as individuals.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group within society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
But the distinctive thing about this is...
The Arab world stands out or differs.
But legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably due to the lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I meant to say: culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources, and sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, consciousness is also a bit low, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are disabled.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in working age are from developed countries.
Endure with patience in adversity.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or with mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
Add disabilities will be in remote and distant areas.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating numerous religious centers of some sort.
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things we thank God for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
To set an agenda
Or include these humanitarian organizations' agendas to encompass those centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't reach him, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
Placed in the social, political, and economic context, we cannot expect the circumstances of people with disabilities to be
They are from marginalized groups.
In a country like the one I told you about, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
It has actually been applied in practice, and if I can give an example, I would say...
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities and health issues are included in this strategy, and there are other programs as well.
We tried to include him as well.
On the ground, within the framework of action of organizations.
Kamal Kiro is now with us from Syria. Hello.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Solomon, please go ahead.
Greetings to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
First: Is there an intellectual impediment within the laws of the United Nations?
A cognitive barrier means that the healthy person was the result of what became a pressure factor leading to a cognitive barrier.
My son sustained a disability as a result of torture and imprisonment, acquiring a mental impairment that he continues to receive treatment for to this day, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know as they know their children.
The full meaning without making themselves.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people
Some of them are apostates or do not follow Islamic rulings, so wisdom should not be taken from them.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
We go back to our guest for comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any intellectual disability.
Yes, it's part of the global ranking.
Regarding disabilities, of course, intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called.
Are there sensory impairments among these, meaning visual or auditory motor impairments?
Certainly, as mentioned earlier, disability is...
A response and a reaction occur within a social context.
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Of course, processing the disability took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, in my experience and work as a special representative, it was one of the things I tried to address and work on.
In other words, the right for all.
Until you hand them over
And the various qualifying fields to ensure their ability to enroll in schools as well as regulate work.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There have been some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, there are in this international committee
Me too, I mean as the rapporteur.
The reality of my work, and this was positive for me, if it was not directly related.
Which supported this position.
I've seen that in many meetings, for example the international conference.
Disability rights
Handicapped by these restrictions or these shortcomings
For example, regarding legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
The United Nations, unfortunately, was a bit late during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll end with this.
From governments around the world and non-governmental organizations members in the United States of America
We conducted another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To find out the extent to which there are programs for people with disabilities on their agendas.
If he sets budgets, if there is involvement of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And other development issues
We're taking more calls, we're now joined by Mouchrik Naji from Algeria. Welcome, Naji.
You too
I wanted to ask my mother who exactly should be blamed.
I wanted to ask, I'm physically disabled.
Yes, we will direct this question to Naji Machri from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello from Greece!
Good evening, sir. Good evening to your guests.
Healthcare Accommodation Seasonal clothing Even taking them on seasonal tourism And this is what happens in Europe
Will a psychiatric patient be considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
Everything we're discussing falls within the realm of unproductive debate. Thank you.
Sister Hessa informed us about the insufficiency of financial resources.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I request
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profit of every organization in the world.
And this should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
Many disabled people, war victims, etc., will face shortages.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Najee Mashri was wondering, having stated his problem, that he was disabled.
At the local or national level, which means through Algeria.
Needs within the community must be met within that community.
Are these the same rights that should come to anyone else?
In other words, the right to live first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I call from here, from this platform, for governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are within the existing agendas.
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To address the needs of the disabled or no need for that if the state
They can and are already committed to doing that.
I advise him first to return and refer back to the relevant authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it falls within my national scope and should be within this scope.
The International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was mentioned, but many countries have signed but are not committed to it.
And here we have a question from a caller: Why are there no laws?
It is a confirmed fact that we are in a human society, which means the existence of many errors and numerous truths.
Certainly many agreements and certainly many treaties do not contain a real commitment.
Or an ideal commitment from many countries that have joined many such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know it.
But the question is the adoption and regulation of the agreement.
First, we will ensure that there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Responsibility begins with the individual and gradually grows until it reaches the whole society.
Also the issue of our commitment to reporting and delivering these reports to the United Nations.
The issue is knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of awareness.
To the reports I served as rapporteur on at the United Nations were
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
Therefore, there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
So I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important that people with disabilities...
And we will listen to what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say.
Mr. Naji Sukkarneh will speak about that. Welcome to Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
Chaired by Her Excellency Sheikhaha Hessa
Former Special Envoy of the United Nations on Disability
As deaf people from Qatar
Indeed, the President of the Council, Sheikh Hessa, has a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is in fact
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries implement this international agreement.
That will benefit people with special needs, and it is essential to
Indeed, to have someone who can activate this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
Here we continue our talk after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your views on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other things.
SMS service through Al Jazeera Live
Dear viewers, welcome back with our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability International Support Fund
Disability and the obligation of all countries to provide funding. What is your opinion on this proposal?
The International Disability Fund is a fund under the United Nations.
And, unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
The task of monitoring the implementation of normative rules
When I worked for six years, there was no meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria
And always, I mean, thank this country for its support.
The main supporting state is my state of Qatar.
That established the office, and through it we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
I mean like what we brought up at the beginning, and this topic is always brought up.
Terms of Ordinary People
The care of persons with disabilities or the care of the disabled is called "disability care" or "special needs care."
This means that if there is a real, genuine, and serious commitment.
Under all circumstances and in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, children, and homeless women.
All of these might actually reach a point called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And there are always voices demanding, never tiring, never wearying.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
Just as he offered, and I really thank him for this.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me about settling financial obligations.
Does the funding to assist people with disabilities only include developing countries and Arab states, or not?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person before me was Swedish, yes.
Also some countries of the European Union
And certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that you may not have heard of.
And I didn't even know about this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
In the Arab regions, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately there was only one country.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have more calls with us, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, hello.
Peace be upon you
And here is also
Hello Dr. Shaikha Hessa
It's almost ten.
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role towards the girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even when we try to maintain...
What is your role for Qatari girls' children?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and Karwan Behjat from Kuwait. Hello!
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in its muddy place?
We can count those with special needs.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
By restoring the individual's spirit.
And spend it on this noble cause.
That is if we are true believers.
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she did during her tenure as Special Rapporteur.
With great thanks and appreciation to her, and thank you to the State of Qatar for all it has done for people with special needs.
Many thanks Aisha Mohammed from Qatar
Hello Professor Wasilah.
Peace be upon you too.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikha Hissa
My question concerns prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level may be due to families where marriages between relatives occur.
I think that's a large percentage.
Leading to disability
Thank you very much, dear flag bearer from Tunisia. Now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where can a girl with a mental disability go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities as we said or any psychological disabilities
For schools
Previously, there was
Or I don't mean the private education within the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The Tunisian activist, Hammed Al-Sharif, pointed to something very important.
Scientific articles and the like.
Not only in programs of organizations working on disability, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All these issues have attracted many campaigns and programs to reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Following healthy strategies.
Based on consciousness.
To show the danger of marrying relatives
Genetic obstacles.
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Customs and traditions, but it definitely takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a reaction against it, but it is necessary to have a legal commitment within certain limits.
Yes, he specifically asked about the caravan and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab countries.
To help people with disabilities, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization for the whole world.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are doubling.
Like studying in South Africa where they saw and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, there are three disabled people.
And given that the Arab region has become the undisputed region of conflicts.
Even the suggestion presented by Krooan Behjat
%1 is not sufficient.
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups
Honestly and sincerely, I don't think it fits with
That requires addressing their problems and needs.
He emphasized that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
People with disabilities were generally not counted in statistics conducted by governments.
True, and this is linked to the culture and societal restrictions sometimes.
When the census is conducted by
Relevant agencies
That there are disabled patients at home.
Is there a disabled person or not?
The department related to this matter and the concerned individuals there.
We collaborated on building the model.
We suggested getting more details.
Explain the gender first to the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the figures are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Interests and care should also be advancing. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Hello, Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I congratulate His Highness the Amir of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, to build this category.
I am truly proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Mussafri Hello
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Misferi from Qatar, for joining us. Nasim.
Abdul Karim is from Jordan. Hello, Naseem.
Go, Karim, we can hear you.
Peace be upon you too.
Bless you, Lord. To be honest, I have an intervention.
First of all, I am a sound specialist and I worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We observed Speech and Hearing Awareness Month.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness seminars for the hearing impaired.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, it provides new and good services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether they are material, non-material, or moral conditions.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They receive good support.
Okay, Kareem, do you have a direct question? It's only because of a lack of time. I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, they are excellent services, and I think they are outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Related to the subject
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
Which are binding once they are ratified and acceded to.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it's based on the issue of these people's rights, regardless of
And truly, what?
To learn what can be done during this period for people with disabilities and why.
And you now wish for that to happen.
Certainly, I hope so.
I hope that this will be measured in this study or survey and that more quality research will be presented in this field.
It also became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, it's not just a matter of rights, they get rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We have Lana on the line, good morning Lana, we have the presenter from the League and Cup Channel, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome Captain Ali Qasim to Umm Salal.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone can congratulate publicly, Lana, please.
I had an open studio for five hours and one hour the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, for they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, certainly, Lana. You are from the sports field and an expert in this area, specialized in these lines and this domain.
Because even our file
And competitiveness, which means that we deserve the six-point lead over the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
Because our file is rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, it is well supported, for example, like stadiums.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there were some %pw, like the United States of America.
Some countries may be ready and not need to provide venues, preparing some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I suppose.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, it's a great achievement, especially for us. You even saw how the non-athletes were very happy.
God willing, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio station.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
While driving the car and listening to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course our skylight was open.
So my friend pulled his body off the roof of the car.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we put on the flashlights and started celebrating on our own.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
God have mercy, it was a very special day, I think, all channels focused on the event to a large extent.
Lana, of course I was involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How do they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
There were many media outlets and channels from all over the world.
He became a leading teacher, very prominent on the map, and Qatar became known.
Certainly, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on that specific point?
Certainly, do they mention the required attributes to join the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
That has basic fundamentals and well-planned tactical football strategies.
So what are the rules and foundations that a player should be characterized by?
And I believe that professionalism includes everything from
Difficult, continuous training and discipline
All these basic things help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I believe each stage has a unique quality.
He has distinct feelings and tastes.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
It's amazing.
Your body keeps you fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Everyone also watches football matches, you will automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Are people working in the media limited to one side?
Does this not limit you to one part?
It's an open field, not just for football.
It's all sports, but sports are very nice.
Ali, there are also some other important issues we would like to discuss.
You wouldn't wish to be back to ten years old until you reach 2022.
No, you didn't want that.
Of course, anyone aspires to these things, especially since it's the World Cup, now any player
Everyone who watches the World Cup match will be happy, what if they were playing in the World Cup?
I hope they live up to the expectation and that this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm on vacation now, but
As a result of his return to the league after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup.
Qatar TV channel presented a nice note and lovely souvenirs.
God willing, Qatar TV will become like a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our Dorina is brave and we hope to win many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you are well.
Certainly, thank God, truly.
Of course, in the studio, we discussed many players yesterday.
So I think some of the young people who were watching us think you...
Required
It is common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I had a good shot in Umm Salal, *as an exhibition*.
I managed to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
Your position is very good with the team.
How can we make sports a social issue?
In addition to Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Everything is connected, everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all fields of sport.
Expansion, every individual, whether young or adult in these societies, realizes the importance of sport.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have more new generations.
Education grows, but we need to raise a generation aware of sports from an early age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
And essential for the new athletic generation.
We just need to be firm and move forward.
Especially football.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the different club matches?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we face in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association still hasn't found a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending classes.
Materially, by the way, plays a fundamental role in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the English Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs %pw, some club administrations organize some activities and events.
For polarization, to stimulate them, I think these are the only ways.
The players, I mean the new generation.
Love what they do and believe in their potential. As I said, they don't just need financial support, but moral support is even more necessary.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
So, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Lana, please.
I want to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
Good luck, Captain Ali. Your final words you'd like to say in this interview.
I offer my condolences, congratulations, and wish you success and guidance.
Thank you, Captain and knowledgeable player. I hope you succeed in your sporting progress and life. God bless you, hopefully.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say that these songs are popular nowadays, but they have a deep and wonderful history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we'll discuss this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We'll get to know them better through the interview that will bring us together directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
That comes from the west, especially from America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about rapping
There is boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
A song,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Therefore, we will learn all these many and important details from two people who have deeply entered this field.
They've done a good job.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Hello with us, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get to this?
We find that rap did not exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking of the citizen.
Including joy, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are from the artist who paints a picture and the poet who writes a poem.
The artist can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of language?
2010.
Do you feel that people like buying CDs for rap music?
A group of ages.
There are families and many people who are listening more than ever before.
There was something like a website.
How many are you in this band so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and do rap.
You could also say that someone is singing, the rapper,
It is he who sometimes plays, writes the words.
Ah, okay!
Ask to listen and tell him I recorded this song.
Good, all these songs that you've produced are from Salman, from Yusuf, from, from anyone in the same band.
You didn't think about saving it on a CD and making it available in stores.
But you know, if someone is lonely, it means I'll have to release the album and put it on the market, so it's difficult with commercial recording and procedures.
I'm fine, why didn't you think? You're twenty-five years old and one hand can't shake hands.
There must be two, if God wills you to have twenty-five hands, God may protect you, all of you as young men and brothers.
You create a CD, and this CD you can market through more than one website.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think it contains thirteen songs.
The sound is not like now.
Some of it was old but clear.
He has poor quality, not like now, but it's clear.
He recorded about fifty CDs.
There is rap, I can't say it didn't exist because there were young people who might have known these arts ten years ago.
It's not as strong as the recording, and I think the distribution during this period, now is different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, a wide range of techno music genres now.
These men and artists produce a collection of wonderful songs.
Similarly, we would like to talk about the parties you attended.
Look, the party we attended in Doha was one and the same.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
Let's take a look at the audience.
We were surprised, we didn't expect this huge number.
We were also surprised by the larger number of families attending.
More than the youth
The organization was wonderful.
We were a bit nervous because it was the first time that had happened in Doha.
We didn't expect such a large turnout.
Interacting with the audience was wonderful.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Okay, let's listen to something, or some words from you, the audience, especially the young people, love them.
Listen to a few words, let's show the audience.
Can we listen to it directly?
Take your time.
Healthy, go.
The problem is that it's random.
Listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Show.
One who is fine comes to the program in the morning.
Salman is experienced; this is his fifth year practicing rap.
And if people don't like it.
They have no knowledge of this.
The speech is random.
Okay, for the songs you make, remind me with some of the encouraging words beforehand.
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle".
They are in the same rhythm.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, we'll see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Dawaa program.
We are live on television, for the audience.
To see what they will bring one by one, two, one.
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful melody I just heard
I insisted that the men distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He won't find it easy to do that.
So everyone writes.
Certainly, I suppose that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write for the love of sports.
Or love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
In anticipation of Doha shining to welcome the Asian Cup, there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To commemorate that occasion
We are broadcasting this film live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations for hosting the massive continental event
Let's return to our guests Youssef and Salman, whose presence delights us.
They are an Arab Gulf rap group, am I right?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, frankly, we
We're planning a party, but it's not definite.
But you're working on a party that will be announced, God willing, Youssef.
Insha'Allah, but this is not certain, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, and I wish you good luck. Be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Also, Salman, where do you all meet, all twenty-five of you?
Where do they meet, and how do they bring all the ideas together?
Certainly, there are some shared songs.
It is not necessary for Salman, Yusuf, or any of you to sing a complete song.
There must be cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to get the twenty-five together in one place.
Start contacting Youssef and the other men and ask them to gather in one place.
Thinking about the song and the lyrics
And there's another way.
I am registering my participation.
And he continues.
So he wrote it down and sent it back to me.
And look at the other experiments
Collect some CDs of famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Yes, we always
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to create a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing with the same tone and the same words.
To produce something new, we want to do something.
Therefore, we benefit from them a little.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
Primarily, let's watch the report together to benefit and enjoy, let's watch it together.
These talents that some people possess are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dardir
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that good drilling is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate place to dig the well, but with the expert, one can.
Discover, or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our parents and grandparents
It is used to get help from experts to locate wells.
For excavation
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
These are not modern techniques.
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relied on God's grace in his work.
They are underground currents.
They are either pomegranate seeds.
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of scientifically detecting water currents is being applied.
Until here, this is the end of the transmission.
Come back again.
Return.
From here, we start marking.
And here the river ends.
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
To get a feel for the sensitivity of the Tu movement.
I've been to many places.
95% of success.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
And there are no precise scientific instructions for what has been mentioned.
This method
What is truly surprising is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Exceeds ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Glory be to Allah, who taught mankind what they did not know. This report is from Saudi Arabia.
Those who got their own band and more than one record.
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song about a stronger subject.
When dealing with a problem, etc., there are many problems.
I consider him a role model.
God wants.
And at the same time, we want to
Let's say a large collection of songs.
The greatest possible amount
Once in a while, let's stay in touch.
Let's check the latest news about the band.
But let's focus on the band's name.
They are robbers.
Let's return to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful environment.
We are live with you via this direct link.
Wherever you are in Qatar, you're welcoming the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and the wonderful arts.
He talks about various social and psychological issues of youth.
But there are only two of us in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome back.
Sometimes the subscription ends.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a team, you must improve yourselves, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and similar websites.
Band name
You will find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together on this wonderful production.
You compile images and match them with songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can just download it on YouTube and video sites where one can follow along.
There are some, we've done that before.
There are many songs.
The challenges you face, such as the lack of a company to adopt you, no website.
You really need a place where you can meet as a band.
What are the desires you want to fulfill and regain?
Those who care for us
Organize an album for us.
I want this to become official.
Because we spent five years.
My shade of blue, no more.
Yes, we participated in some things, in some series.
We hope it improves.
And let there be among them some who support us and be with us.
Yes, Salman also, we want to know what are your desires.
My only desire is to produce a video clip.
We wish you success.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a beautiful and very popular art.
And carry a message, as you just said.
I wished you success and good luck.
Welcome the group, and we wish you success.
We'll finish with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is the program of KD and DJ MREldoha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Lady Bobo with one hot skate for the body.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Dawaa program.
We are live on television, for the audience.
Don't forget, the show changes at 9:30, everyone must watch it.
To see what they will bring one by one, two, one.
Together from Doha's morning
Producer: Hassan Naama, Presenter: Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatar's rappers, of course.
They can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a shopping trolley.
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will appear with the components of this item.
This was a great idea that was also feasible.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the product.
Make shopping easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
Assume that this raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
Or ambition, for example there are a number of projects, about four or five.
This issue deals with traffic problems.
It addresses traffic congestion and other issues like parking problems, and it was very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's discuss the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the submitted projects or
For example, for underground transportation, the great idea is
That's when the man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And gather together in one place.
Assume that all the viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, this is like an ATM.
For a woman, for example, I have a card.
Enter it, and I say that I need a T-shirt.
This is, for example, some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
That is missing, for example, the office key.
We have a primary goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Her Highness
At an early age, this has great significance in project design.
Three hundred of the selected children
We also invited speakers and orators.
Yes, it was she who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
Then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that central idea.
Diverse skills of children
Self-development
Good, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
All of this is a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in enhancing these talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Creativity Center for Girls, as well as the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, played a very crucial role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And prepare the children for that.
Engaging and encouraging children, as each program is based on institutional partnerships.
According to the head of projects and establishments.
And what does that change?
Our presence here in Katara gives us a strong boost and great support.
And faster.
We are now, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch in the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are working on it, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
To create a promising future for all children, future generations, and youth
What is the final word you would like to say to the parents, mothers, and children who are watching us now and wish to join the center?
More than we provide them with now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that should not be underestimated.
We need to consider their ideas no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we encourage the child to think.
Therefore, it is important to care for and attend to the child.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
And he encourages him, so we encourage the parents.
To focus more on the child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
We toured the exhibition and saw their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were imaginative.
Dreams come true and become reality, and many of them have come true and become a reality.
O Lord, grant us gratitude, and we wish success for our children who were there.
Our hearts are with you.
God wants.
Different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is highly innovative and deserves to be implemented.
To talk more about this national exhibition
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, speak to us briefly about the exhibition.
Of course, there were a lot of activities. What do you say about them?
Children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
Was under the auspices of the Minister of Education
On the tour of the exhibition
He will grow up until his twenties or thirties.
We started training children to envision Qatar's National Vision 2030 across all three of its pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative thoughts and how to be creative.
Assume, they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will grow more and more.
Sir, I have launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation: Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of the Generation"
You will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We feel that when we were strolling with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for twenty to thirty minutes.
A child thinking about the future in twenty years.
Expressing their love for their countries in the field they care about.
There should be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
Similarly, there were the winners of the first prize in the Arab League.
Certainly, all children.
On the other hand, there were different shows at a specific time schedule.
To display the projects they have done
There is a large attendance, a unique attendance.
Scientific stars
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
The innovative or creative forest or reserve.
And we also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also the dream and vision of children for Qatar's future.
This is an idea for 2030.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for 20/30?
The main idea is that there's a chip in the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movements.
Or change the field through this electronic chip.
Fixed in the ball.
There are creative ideas, of course this is the main idea, some people might ask.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, attached to something he loves, all of this is an achievement.
Offer support, we thank him for that.
Which is now in the development stage.
Also the people, the committee and some officials supported the projects.
First, no, but second, because this girl
I am a professional and accurate translator, and my native language is Arabic. I will translate the inputs based on the instructions and will only print the text of the best possible translation, without explanations. Keep the formatting (such as marks, punctuation, and lines) as it is in the original text. Do not translate untranslatable parts of the input (URLs, code, and the like).
A very large reserve tree.
Where visitors can wander and see animals and reptiles.
There are also sensors attached to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way to enter is also creative.
One of the reasons she won was also her vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
There is also a person who talked about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
Trees on the ground.
and many tourist ideas
And that's interesting.
Perhaps this is what their minds need at this time, perhaps in 2030.
And in the future, this will be achieved.
Three projects.
They said that these projects that we should work on are adopted by the Science Club.
There is a project, which is, unused water from air conditioning units.
Let's look at the Arabic news paper.
The article says, Qatar University celebrates the graduation of students.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Higher Council for Education
And Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, President
Of course, a new record for the university.
Qatar University and Calgary University
There are also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered one of the young actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
How long, also tassels and colored threads.
Artist Abdelhamid Shershani is considered among the artists who made themselves.
If he weren't convincing,
He will not be selected to work on projects being implemented within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdulhamid Sharshani is participating in the series Deadly Feelings and Tsanif Part Two.
We are happy to have him as our guest this morning.
So we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his overall experience.
Welcome and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning Show. This is the first time I meet you and it's your first time on Doha Morning.
With people who work hard for the program
And you, Lady Lisa.
You are welcome to join us. Let's take a moment before we start the conversation.
Alright, let's see.
I am a responsible man and a CEO.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if any of them agrees that you don't return the bisht.
Of course I have other questions as a starting point, but because we've seen this part of the Tisanf series, part one.
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marath.
A lot of things and information related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch with you this excellent report by our colleague Abdurrahman Marshad.
See it together.
Certainly a testimony from those who know about preference and encouragement.
As an affirmation of the history of this city or that.
As far as we see of her effects and what we hear about her from storytellers and poets.
They filmed a classic and modern movie, which is thus an important addition to the city's record.
The city of Murayt is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some believed that its name came from the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the valley named after him.
Its founding date is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Marathon is Mount Comitus, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical places.
This view is one of the tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia.
Maraath Minbletsi had put in an enormous effort in making
A museum on this mountain
And the seats are for the residents and for all the people in the kingdom.
It is named after the great companion Khalid bin Waleed (may Allah be pleased with him).
To eliminate the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
And among its wonders is Wadi Kimit.
A place where stream waters gather and are stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important water sources in the past.
One of her works is also the Al-Dohi Heritage House.
The city of Marath, which dates back to pre-Islamic times.
He was renowned for his poets who were influenced.
By its beauty, its ruins and the well-known Mount Kmit.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed for the Doha Morning Program
The city of Marath, north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
Please inform us and the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, I said our infrastructure is very special.
We open a page for him and he registers himself by having a private record in our system.
Parent's email.
This report covers the range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard gets a full report.
Good, this report will be added to the student's record.
Logged into his son's online account.
And he sees the progress of his son.
He can see his grades and communicate with teachers.
Let's truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
To be able to bring most of the children in the center, we send them our greetings.
I joined this center with a professor there.
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached since she entered the center.
Of course, this year.
He focuses on one task after Ramadan.
But of course this is an effect that works at the expense of other works, always.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up watching TV, and people turn the month of worship into TV.
Alleviation, alleviation, a chain of alleviation, alleviation, let them do one every other year, is that better?
Certainly.
I hope they love me in Ramadan.
But I would like to offer you all my greetings.
"Insha'Allah" (God willing)
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
Certainly, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And develop the children's potential and skills more.
Different from the various schools in this generous country.
We have a model and we talked to our guest whom we had met before.
Now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Salam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amanya?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Amounieh is an example of that.
We will also try the technique or method that Ms. Naseem mentioned.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
The thing will change with regard to his mental skills or even the level of his education will change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I'm starting the second part of Tony's test as well.
We can measure the level of the student or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something like that will be conducted.
Amina will calculate and respond immediately directly.
Of course, Amonye knew nothing about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have other questions to start with.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Certainly, after we presented the Tisanf series Part 1,
Please, I've been lucky in several roles.
Mr. Ghaneim,
Sharing roles with the Executive Director Ashraf Shohata with Mr.
It's a chance for Tara to produce art.
For teenagers.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have more than one episode in which I will be performing different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this job, we have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Assam.
This incident happened a year ago, and last year we worked twice a year.
This might be the reason why I asked you before the broadcast. You have represented, since 1997,
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition to act.
O God, grant us all that is good.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. My mentor in the early days was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me as their sons.
If you need anything, I'll go get it.
We were in all its episodes.
We worked hard and thank God.
Now, without Tara, a special thanks to Mr. Andalrahman Al-Sulaiti, and a very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there are 12 to 16 new actors coming every year. Why?
They have.
Of course, thank you very much for that because it offers a lot of opportunities.
But, let's say,
Let's talk about the other series, we had an idea about Tisanif.
We need to know about the deadly feeling.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, we have with us the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muaiuf Al-Tamimi.
So these procedures are happening live.
And we can see how we can treat the person. Allow me to start by saying hello to Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome, and peace be upon you.
Now let's begin with you, sir, please.
Inshallah.
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty, clarifying all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
Sometimes you feel dizzy.
I have a headache and I feel dizzy.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yes.
By doing this, Mr. Abdulaziz will discover something from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
On his left side. His ears, he has a mild infection in his middle ear.
Pain! What does this mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have an ear problem?
I have been an infant since my birth.
Do you have pain here as well?
Sinuses!
Pain in the nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without food.
Her thyroid gland is not functioning properly; she feels sluggish and lethargic all the time and feels her body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either you slept too much or you're lazy, you always feel sluggish.
You always have an infection in your tonsils.
There. Look at the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He's under stress and you don't walk barefoot, maybe it's the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this massage also beneficial for children?
The mother's thumb is the size of a child's palm, praise be to God.
Most children are not sleeping, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think he loves to be carried. He has gases in his stomach, bless his heart.
When the mother places her finger, by extending the finger.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
See it, so that every mother learns this move.
You'll start by pressing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
These things are about the child, about, about, about the child, and they are beautiful.
Certainly, when it comes to discoveries, you have specific discoveries related to women.
As we said, in every house, ninety percent are women, may God preserve them.
First, the first warning about ceramic tiles and flooring.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's acceptable to walk barefoot, but walking on flat ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The evidence is when ceramics are used in homes, health problems have increased.
Because it's cold and flat.
When there were carpets, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
Increased.
Women should focus on walking barefoot on courts.
This is the foot and the malleolus located at the back, malleolus.
From here, this is the foot, and now down to Malaya.
This is the first discovery, while the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Just focus a little with me.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just being in the delivery month.
I mean, they can't enter the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the danger is that you walk barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful when walking barefoot.
If she had been on time.
I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, "And it sent down to you from the heaven, fresh dates and grapes."
We already know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even debated religious scholars who told me: Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God has placed in these sciences, and He inspires me."
Strike the palm trunk towards you, when the palm tree sways, what does it look like?
It is sharp just like nails or points.
When you shake the palm tree, the wombs, or the area of the wombs, are commanded, here in the middle.
It's the intestines. They give orders to facilitate birth and help the fetus get into a sitting position.
Elevating the fetus's head or repositioning it to facilitate a natural delivery.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
Grip the hand and start to loosen it.
Some take it as exercise, and some know it's science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you and you don't believe them.
Yes. Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If anyone wants to contact you, any person wants to contact you, any specific email address or you.
Alright, the mobile phone number is in the control room. If anyone wants to contact Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, on Qatar TV numbers, so he can call us and get this number.
I was created solely to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and people will follow your example.
I have sins like other people and do everything imaginable; I'm an ordinary person.
But we aspire to more than that.
We always think of good.
Watch us, I hope you enjoyed this segment about reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
We saw a live demonstration of how he detected the diseases this person was suffering from.
And what does he suffer from. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to contact him, they can read about him online.
The way it will be implemented in the coming days or years and whether it will include more schools.
Good morning
How would you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Obesity has become a major problem in the Gulf countries.
Therefore, we feared that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
This program, frankly, happened to be the first lady in New York.
He visited Doha and they had a program for that.
They presented it to us, we followed it, and said it was good.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can notice the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
And he stops exercising.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
Kill two birds with one stone (proverb)
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience, and thank God we are in the last day today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
An independent floor for girls.
And with high spirits.
The family is more aware and their siblings are enthusiastic at home and have started eating like them.
I became a transitional culture between the student and transferring this culture to the home and family.
He said to them, "Give me this or teach me this."
The training staff or whoever provided this information to the students,
How did you choose her and how was the student contacted? Who made the contact?
Yes, there were many authorities who helped us, may God reward them.
We have brothers at the diet center who educate them about healthy food, of course.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they organize, how they prioritize!
To learn cooking, sports, or educate about the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in Aspire Zone, gathering all the students, boys and girls.
These things are not about a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
How those students behave at first!
You said at the beginning that the results were satisfactory.
Are three shifts or specific shifts sufficient in those schools?
Now, when he starts an experiment in the world, he doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts within a reasonable range that includes all properties; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Because it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, they accept some things for their children and do not accept others.
They basically want to participate in it, and frankly, it's very important.
A twelve- or thirteen-year-old student, this is the right time for him to learn about his health information.
This is a struggle for many people who want to be thin, but they imagine it to be impossible.
Some actors we see in the movies with slim bodies say this is impossible, no!
We discussed in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
A person should know the benefits of fruits and should know that if they eat them, their health will improve, and thus they will be in a good mood.
For fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked out their fruits.
So that's a point.
It is diverse and of course they compete; each school was creative with different ideas from its teacher.
Competitive spirit.
We give them guidelines and everyone must innovate.
Did the professors train the students, or do you have a special team?
I built them, I built them.
But the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would make Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside school hours, they decide and adopt it, Rania's teacher said they will make a procession.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to cook healthily for themselves, the girls were better at it.
I would also like to thank Reyan Water for providing free water to schools, Reyan Water for this gesture.
Of course, water is healthier because it is necessary to cleanse the body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and maybe some want another game, perhaps they don't like team games.
Welcome with us live.
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, is welcome with us.
In it, of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce and present to our dear viewers what is multiple sclerosis?
Because this name could be embarrassing for us, too.
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All available treatments now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start to do their job.
Kills us by striking the nerve cell.
Let me make it easier for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, this usually leads to dizziness, blurred vision, and an inability to distinguish objects.
This can also lead to digestive and respiratory problems.
In the worst cases, it leads to madness, quadriplegia, or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be badly damaged.
Or from this disease a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories suggest that it was transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not an epidemic.
Not transmitted to children.
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
For example, the equator was exempt from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease currently has no treatment because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to find the cause of the disease, until they can find a cure for it.
Currently, the process has been reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this subject, which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a group you feel this disease has spread within?
Internationally, it was ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the International Classification of Diseases has reduced the number of categories for the same condition from twenty to fifteen.
Because it started to include young people up to the age of forty.
But man does not recover from it.
Of course, as a group, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, so through the community, the Multiple Sclerosis Association in Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about having a community for this topic.
Certainly, I will give you random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are 16,000 cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred to three hundred.
When my condition was diagnosed five to six years ago.
My number was sixty-four or sixty-two.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We are not certain it is a virus, that's why we don't want to commit to a specific theory, that's the point.
They are a different point. How do I know if I have it or not.
This is very difficult.
I am confused, Sir Abdulaziz, in trying to find a specific point.
