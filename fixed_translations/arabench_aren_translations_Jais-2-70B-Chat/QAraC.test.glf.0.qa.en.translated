If you don't want it, I do.
O Sultan, what are you saying?
It's a shame, a chance, a chance that came to us, to our hands, and we're going to waste it from us, it's a shame.
Then, I'm not insisting on a topic that I have the right to take, and you actually have the right to take before me.
Sultan, for the love of your parents, don't bring us any trouble.
Saleh, don't become something, seek forgiveness from God.
On your honor, is there a brother who advises his brother with what you are saying?
You are hungry.
I found in front of you a tray containing rice and meat.
The Chinese have no ruler, no shepherd, and no one to set them boundaries.
Tell yourself the truth.
This Chinese dish should not be placed in front of us again.
Don't be a coward, Saleh.
And he's wasting the opportunity for us.
La la la, don't try, it's impossible, impossible, it's not me who does this.
The problem is that he's afraid.
Aichaf Ashmene.
This is a government project where everyone takes and siphons off.
This is a rule.
Now, people who have no relationship with the projects are taking them.
He is the chairman of the project committee of the Greater Khartoum area.
What does it mean, I mean, he has the thread and the bobbin.
The World Beaches Project for the Third Millennium, in parentheses, infrastructure, phase one.
The bull leaned on him.
This is the one with the vacuum.
If he's taken.
What business is it of yours?
You have no right to take from their project.
Since his car was broken down.
Whoever was supposed to provide the project location, it wasn't me.
No no if it's like that then you have the right.
Who gives you the right to pump petrol into your car four times and five times?
Let it be on me.
Don't become a stubborn mule and insist on your own way.
Reach out and grab it.
Joeve, Khamees, Real, Your Aunt.
Now, as you would say, they tell you you're a millionaire.
One-third of the total is the project's right.
One-third is commission.
The one who plays in the folk band.
They say they're having a party for the country.
And we bought a hundred lanterns.
What did they do?
We put the row.
There's no use, my aunt.
May God guide him, God willing.
And he eats his family with him.
Last night, I tried with him all night long.
This is an opportunity.
So that goodness may prevail.
And goodness, God willing, will prevail.
This is something well known.
We want the matter to be between us.
Don't go outside.
After, he still needs a recommendation.
Just the guys.
A problem that can stop us like a bone in the throat.
The riyal started to soften.
I'm spending today with him.
The morning is two hours.
And he started to be convinced.
He will be back with us soon for a meeting.
And we have to work on it, you and I, properly.
The one who wants to cut off our livelihood.
They didn't start listening to him until they had completely brainwashed him.
My brother Ali, my brother Othman.
I don't know.
As if today is my first day of work.
No problem at all.
How can it not happen?
Sure, but are you sure I should take it?
Now I'm asking you.
You are hungry and walking on the road.
Are you eating, or not eating?
I am a big eater.
It's no
Chinese return
We're just on the first point of the meeting.
If there's something wrong with you.
And if you have a fear...
What I want to know.
You and I are from the project.
May God guide you, Saleh.
You might be because it's the first time you participated as the chairman of a committee in a government project.
And this is simple, I swear to God.
Our destiny is placed.
This is part of the project's budget.
How come then?
So that no one feels the story.
We put a condition by itself for the amount.
This amount was withdrawn.
By the L L project managers.
Nothing happens.
No no no, Saleh!
You know the proper way.
But it seems there is some fear inside you.
This is his right, of course.
In the beginning and the end.
Everything is in our hands.
You didn't tell me you were attractive.
What's wrong with you? (repeated for emphasis)
He said my friend's new car is genuine.
Here he says.
The car is fine, okay, good.
And in a prime location.
If someone has money, that's it.
I won't tell you, someone else told me or I heard it.
He bought the land for him and registered it in his name.
He told me, "Please."
He wants the money in his hand now.
It's attracting attention now.
We're not like that, man.
That's it, then.
What happened to the head?
He's taking us out the East Gate.
He wants to go by himself to eat a bite.
Don't shake your head.
Or else, your brother.
You come and sit, and you'll have nothing but goodwill. Come.
I waited for him all night.
I told him it doesn't matter who it is, they deserve it and they deserve it.
I made him agree.
This is supposed to be.
And God willing, you won't take a woman all at once, just like that.
This project, Global Beaches for the Third Millennium.
In parentheses, infrastructure.
He came back later, and then they started the second phase.
And you continue with him.
May God reward you well, you didn't fall short.
That's good that you only made him agree.
And you are in the same situation as others.
But there's nothing wrong with it.
I hope I convinced him.
We want a percentage.
They are all in agreement regarding the percentage.
Until he told me after he agreed.
It appears they are inviting their friends to attend the budget allocation meeting for the project.
It is their right and they must follow it.
They put it, they are sure about it.
We will submit it as soon as possible so that you can rely on it.
Make yourselves at home.
Brother, who is this? Do you know him?
This becomes the husband of the madam, yesterday evening with me.
This means.
You have doors, windows, and everything related to finishes.
Sweet sweet.
How much more do you need so we can finish?
You are the one who set a limit for yourself.
We take something.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And we determine the amount we take.
There are people waiting and wanting.
Abdulaziz's words are right.
Someone, define for yourself half a million.
This week, Akon should have calmed down.
And he determines the amount he wants.
They decided, thought, and determined.
What if you're like this?
Kid, do as you please.
Don't mind them, don't pay attention to them.
She is the companion of what is in you, what is in, what's wrong with this one?
What do I know about what God has thrust upon us with that one?
Hey, you from Egypt, you're inside this project, you huh?
This is a government-owned company.
Your brother Saleh, his name is Sultan.
This is our neighbor's driver.
The hours will reach us until the car broke down for me.
Write it down.
Sana Abdullah
No no there are three others too
What should I do with it? I'm tired of it.
I'll just tell him, "Hey, let's get our budget out and finish this up."
No no, this is a lump sum.
How much should I put for him?
And this poor man, he has children.
Okay, here's the translation of the input text: "Has he increased it? Add twenty-five to two hundred."
And a quarter of a hundred.
His concern is stuck to him like glue.
How much are you going to distribute to them?
Wade is back.
The good mother, when mentioned.
Yes, Mom.
Oh no, no, no, but this is the last one, oh father.
No, Dad, you want to go to Thailand to get treated.
Wait, wait, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you, acting so heavy like this?
Only what remains from the first phase, in parentheses, infrastructure.
Not used.
Add three thousand to their number.
Buy me hours from Thailand, the ones where the whole diamond shines like this.
Here, I recorded it.
My Imamate.
No, Mom, I registered it myself. I just wanted to make sure with you about the name.
My love, I'm telling you, my dear.
enkbir alsinih
Okay, but then the budget must be determined. It can't remain open like this.
Tomorrow is the most important meeting, and everyone will say the amount they have in mind.
Don't worry
A million is enough.
وايد حبيبي
Hey people, hey people, wait a moment, what's the noise? Give us a chance.
The committee is meeting now as they are about to approve the project's budget. The subject of the money is now closed.
I keep getting bigger.
We told you to calm down about the scandal. We are sitting in the ministry's yard.
Oh, shut up, don't embarrass us.
Oh, someone is still here and asking what's going on, why are you all gathered here?
Here's the translation: **"We're saying we lost electricity, it's faulty and there's a short."**
Get out of here and stop causing a commotion in the ministry's courtyard.
Come on, hurry up, come on, hurry up.
You heard the story.
Dude, you were with them for a while. How much did the budget increase?
Who but my brother?
With the project, we all mean all of us, fifty million.
This is just the first phase, fifty million.
How much did the amount reach?
This is Saleh.
Oh man, the one in the middle is safe.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.
Come on, hurry up and let's get to work. The beneficiaries are all waiting for us, you see.
No problem, but the most important thing is that we don't want any discussions. They should approve the budget and that's it.
And from tomorrow we will start implementing the project.
It serves a very large class of society.
This, may God grant you peace, is the Global Beaches Project for the Third Millennium.
This, may God grant you peace, is the first stage.
In parentheses, infrastructure.
This project is for future generations.
Of course, on behalf of the program's family, we would like to congratulate you and also bless you for the opening of the project, which, as far as I believe, will be tomorrow, God willing.
Which took a million and a half years to work on.
A year and a half.
Once again, of course, in the name of the At'a Program for the Future.
This project...
And for future generations.
And may God perpetuate upon us the blessings of oil.
A second, third, and tenth stage.
With the attendance of a delegate.
Welcome and welcome.
Why are they making us wait here? When will the cars come to take us?
Come on, where are they taking us? What's wrong with you?
Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds. You've grown up and become senile, you.
We all sat in the sun and died from the heat.
Hey, woman, girl! (depending on context and tone)
But I don't see anything.
There was nothing in front of me but the sea.
Why did they remove you?
Iman told me that your sister Munirah is here.
About the issue of my father's land that is in the desert.
You said, "Okay, then look and see who deceived her and told her false news."
This isn't the right land.
But when one sees a farm in the desert, one says, "This belongs to my father."
Then what do you want with these things?
Do you have any siblings?
They work hard, mashallah, and invest in land, tiring themselves out with real estate and companies.
Who is the head?
Oh no, Iman!
And then my sister.
How come you don't know?
They have to give it to me.
These are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than honesty.
Because money.
We have become the ones who give charity to her and take her to the hospital.
How many years has she been in court with her brothers now?
Nineteen years, if not more.
Never again.
Brothers, are Salem and Harami safe?
He came back, and yesterday you were telling me.
My father, just build me a small mosque before I die.
You don't know.
I'm not saying that your brothers are like that, God forbid.
My father died a few years ago.
Why now are you coming to ask?
And she saw the estate.
What else do you want?
Not every three months, he goes to check on her.
Falcon, calm down, let us know what's going on.
Not up to her.
We changed, by God, our sisters are not seeing reals.
The solution is with me.
Where are you from?
And it's not like I'm broke.
Munira Shagoof
May God keep you safe, swallow (it).
It became fifty thousand.
Because I dared to ask about my father's land in the desert.
I'm sure my right is more than this.
Every single one of them lives in that vast desert.
And their children are in the best schools.
What should I tell you, Munira?
I'm not keeping silent about my rights.
That's it, I'll take my share.
We invest your money in the company, it's better for you. No, I don't want to.
Everyone is the head of the other.
Mercy is dead in people's hearts.
Don't say that your brothers will turn out better than my brothers.
Join me.
Twelve years.
And I struggle in these courts.
And in the end.
I didn't get either the truth or a lie.
Okay, why are they doing this?
That's why I tell you, my dear mother, be patient with them.
Take them gently.
His blessings be upon him.
Okay, why do the courts take all these years?
We are all four hundred thousand.
If we reach millions like other countries...
I swear to God, my mother, I don't think so until a verdict is issued.
My liver, you are my brothers.
I swear, Mom, I don't want anything.
Oh mother, what shall I say?
I don't say anything other than "Our Lord is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs against the oppressor."
Allah is sufficient for us and He is the best Disposer of affairs.
Didn't you have a court appointment a week ago?
What has become of me, my mother?
The judge says, "Write a memo."
And here we are, oh mother, from one notebook to another.
Look, Mom, they're going to invest millions, and you can see it.
And with what you told me, I will love you and take care of you.
I am not taking what is rightfully mine.
That's why I say, if I were you,
Shut up about what they give me.
Because the woman.
Your father's money is with us.
Men are asking you.
This is a very
Here are a few possible translations, depending on
She just wants to meet, hang out for a bit, and that's it.
If not, what is the evidence?
Go to hell and take him with you.
I will go alone.
I expect us to sign a waiver.
Two hundred and fifty is too much for her, her husband works.
It seems or else bang your head against the wall.
What made her talk now?
But greed
And paradise is not my destiny.
My father inherited it and he determined what you want or how you prefer.
Neither I nor he will decide.
This is God's command.
Why do they torture my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to turn out like this.
This is what money does.
She has been working for thirty or forty years.
I don't know how to handle this, Nasser.
It is easy to find out about lands, buildings, and real estate.
How should I know how much they profit?
Even the company.
You have the right to go and find out everything.
And I won't let them go.
How can you go back to them?
It's not up to you.
And it's not up to you, I have the right to be informed about everything.
An agency without a doorman.
Your sister has made an official power of attorney.
He is allowed, by this power of attorney, to access everything we have at the company.
Saqr Saad
Oh, he's getting a long tongue.
Falcon is done.
Brother Nasser.
Excuse me, I'm taking...
At your service, Your Excellency.
Come on, you are in front of me.
Excuse me, let's go.
Don't let him get anything on us.
Sure, now if he goes and complains.
He said that you hit him.
That means we'll leave it to him.
In his hand is an official document.
We can't stop him, it's official.
He has the right to see everything, all everything.
If Jaf the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If the budget is dry, scrutinize it properly.
Multiply twelve by eight.
Zain divided her share into three parts.
Thirty-two.
Do you know how much it comes out to?
This is what we're demanding from her.
This is different if he finds out about the lands and projects.
And how are we?
We are not afraid.
He wants a welcome, if not, this is what's available.
He goes, he deals with it, him and her.
They give their sisters small amounts of money to live on.
A married woman.
Her husband provides for her.
What do I care about the money?
Yeah, you, this is the right talk.
At your service, sir/madam.
Let him do as he pleases.
Even my office.
My brother Rashid, this meant that it was supposed to be from the beginning.
At your service.

When she found out her true inheritance.
Besides the villas and lands that you don't know about.
They turned out to be seven.
Come out, you sixteen land.
And she's just blindly following it.
She was shocked, poor thing.
That's really unfair.
Follow them.
Please, father, don't bring up the subject of the court to me.
The best a human can offer.
The coldest thing the angry person has.
One minute text.
And then he says his usual phrase.
Seven four two thousand and I don't know how many.
You see, it's a holiday with them, father.
You shouldn't move from the room at all, Mom.
May God heal you, God willing.
No no, the house is your house, what are you saying?
Nusur and my sister Munaur.
After we caught him, we kicked him out of the company.
Find someone who was with me in school and send them to me.
Someone named Abdullah.
Oh really?
Shame on you, really.
This means he can influence them.
God willing, he can.
Yes, yes, yes.
You do not resort to the courts.
The courts, all they have behind them are memos.
And postponements and a slaughter of lawyers on another
Do the years pass?
And life goes on.
And you won't get a single riyal from them.
May God have mercy on her, Umm Salmin.
She instructed me one day before she died.
She told me to bear it, or else I would go to the courts.
Our courts, oh well.
She died without taking a single penny of her inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge.
How would it be if we were like the other countries?
Hello Abdullah.
Brother Abdullah.
Years have passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
May God keep you for each other.
The most important thing.
The family and brotherhood.
Brother Rashid.
You're like a brother to me.
Don't let problems, money, and.
Do you have another topic besides my sister's topic that you are talking about?
You, if you please.
And why should I silence him?
He's right.
They begrudge me my father's lawful wealth.
Yesterday, my mom told me that my brother Saad's wife passed away.
And her father is a correspondent at the ministry.
All of it is from my father's legitimate earnings.
We have been patient all this time.
Let's see this last attempt.
I sent your friend Abdullah to them.
They disrespected him, were rude to him, and expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdulrahman is going to do with them.
Really good.
He told me, God willing, oh Nasser.
It's okay.
I'll threaten them with court.
You forgot the late Umm Salmin and her argument about the courts.
It seems like the brothers of Um Salmeen think it's normal for the court.
But my brothers.
They can't even stand up to people's gossip.
They might say it's shameful to go to court, what will people say about us?
Let's see what the religious Sheikh Abdulrahman will do.
May God greet you and bless you.
The input text
You have nothing, so get out.
What are you saying, my son?
He's telling the truth.
Get out, go on, get up.
I'm going to the courthouse tomorrow morning.
And why should I postpone it until tomorrow?
Then I'm the one who decides, not you.
What does "ashbisar" mean, from now until after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid.
Take it from me.
I told you before.
Let me threaten them with court.
Now he is begging me to postpone my departure.
Because they saw the truth, my dear.
It's necessary to go to your sister, Noor.
What is this?
You told me what this is. May God keep you safe.
May God keep the attendees safe.
A very small scale model of the courthouse.
May God keep you safe.
May God keep the attendees safe.
May your
You're the only one who said it.
I told you not to go out today.
Leave it until after tomorrow.
Because for God's sake, I am preparing this document for the court building.
Ready, we got tired in it, Ikon Endlag, the way.
Adhesives are coming from this door.
The first thing you do when you enter through the door.
You're putting all your stuff.
A telephone made of some metal so that it does not make the sound bip bip bip bip bip.
Are you recording the case? They tell you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight elevators, you ride.
Go around to the offices.

And this one too.
You want to complain about us.
Yaaine andeleha al tareeg.
And when will you take your right?
You take six hundred thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye.
Our dinner today was at my sister's house.
Oh, the ministry approved his project, Abu Walid.
My sister is saying he's flying with joy, can't believe it.
He told me to go ahead with my project, and he invited me to dinner at his place.
Oh God, thank God, after the destiny, mine, once only.
Oh, how happy you must be now, Abu Walid!
He's got it made.
My sister is saying yesterday he couldn't sleep from the joy.
Glory be to God, O منال.
Oh, it's Walid, he's not into these things, but God put good people in his way.
God willing, tell your father.
Forgive us then for any shortcomings.
There's nothing wrong with him, Abu Walid.
May God keep you safe, Abu Walid. You did not fall short.
May God enrich you and increase your bounty, God willing.
You're a great cook, I swear, Umm Walid.
Now he put a good accountant for you and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me, "Just pay the office rent and leave the rest to us."
Here you go, uncle.
My beloved, apple of my eye.
My father wants a BlackBerry.
We want to build a big house.
Look, he's lost his face.
Dad, we agreed today that you would give a speech after the meal.
And now, esteemed guests, with the words of the project owner, my father, Abu Walid, let him proceed, thank you.
Forgive us then.
Congratulations, congratulations, Abu Walid.
You deserve it, you deserve it. Bless you, you deserve it.
But honestly, you have nothing to do with business and trade.
Oh man, this project has a story, guys.
The transl
Look how it means, thank God.
That year.
The day the Japanese national team plays against us.
I am at Souq Waqif.
I don't know about him.
This is a factory catalog for multi-story halls. The ministry on our end has requested that you provide them with a submission.
Which contractor will build for you?
He doesn't understand.
Any contractor.
These Japanese people aren't a game.
It stops as soon as the computer tells you to.
I want a movie.
I wanted a kitchen, bang, a kitchen.
I'll tell you, the day I presented the catalog to the ministry's committee.
How's your agreement with the factory going?
I paid them an amount.
Submitted means
The most important thing is your agreement with the factory.
I signed it, thank God.
And they gave me a grace period until I place my first order.
What are we waiting for then?
They did adopt it, right?
We just wait for a stroke of Fahad's signature.
Here's what your secretary told you.
Gohar said that Bu Fahad didn't show up for work.
Get you tea.
Hey Abu Walid, good news, did you do it?
The problem is, Fahad, you don't know him. He might come, and he might not come.
A day exists.
It's out of date.
Okay, come now.
You are the manager here.
Do you want Bu Fahad to kill me?
He must be the one to sign.
Inside all these files, my desk is full and I need Bu Fahad's signature.
And the solution means
May God help you.
It's a quarter to two, oh Abu Walid.
The workday is over.
I don't think that Bu Fahad will come.
May God help you, come tomorrow.
You're saying that the manager, who you've known for a long time and is your friend, is the one you're talking about.
What's wrong with you?
The manager is a very loud, obnoxious, and unprofessional person who is just sitting there as a picture on the desk.
I wonder why people are sitting at their desks all the time.
What a shame, but at least the starch in their ghutras (headscarves) is still there.
You scratched me, I stopped the office, I say, I'm entering an opportunity, I'm coming for an opportunity.
It means they don't do anything at all.
They don't move a chair unless it's by Bofahad's order.
Yesterday, the boss didn't ask about you.
And the interests of God's creation are being hindered.
It means, "So, you're going to them again today, judging by how you look."
He's in trouble, I swear to God.
Every day that passes, I have a problem.
Because the factory gave me a deadline.
No, God willing, no, God, no, let him say it.
Okay, and what if he asks about you?
Not just you are waiting for Abu Fahd.
Look at these files.
They all await Bo Fahd's signature.
I'm expecting him to come today.
Rest assured.
Otherwise, go for a walk.
If that's it, I'll call you.
If something happens, I'll call you, but don't call me, you're scaring the poor guys.
Okay, goodbye.
Forgiveness, you got scared, ma'am.
Hey kid, it's been a month since they approved my appointment.
But when the man falls, my brother, what is this talk?
Oh father, my daughter's university registration appointment is being wasted. The scholarship papers are not yet complete, oh father.
And my problem is with the factory. The deadline, the deadline.
You guys, just wait a little bit.
All your transactions are expected.
The riyal is drinking his coffee, but once he finishes, they will start on him.
He already told you to be quiet, that's it.
May you live long.
Goodbye.
Wait a moment, everyone.
Wait, where are you going? Hold on a bit.
Understand what happened.
What happened next?
He had an important trip to take care of.
He has a private door.
This is not a state.
Brother, our interests have stopped, brother.
Every day, just enter, enter, move, Fahad.
What should we do? Wait for Abu Fahd.
How much does the courier cost?
May God blame those who blame him.
Where does he find it from, or where does he get it from?
The factory in Japan.
They sent him a message that the deadline is about to end.
Your aunt is from another side.
Oh, poor thing, she lent him some money.
Where does he find it, from which side or the other?
Mother, I am very worried about my father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you talking to?
Hello from
Abu Walid.
So you can tell me about the factory and the money related to your wife's sister.
Wait for Abu Fahad, he's coming.
How long do I have to wait, Dad?
They have nothing but...
This is us waiting for Abu Fahd.
Oh father, you are not being remiss with me.
But all my friends will be working at the university next week.
What's wrong, Dad?
The phone, oh father.
No matter what happens, I hope you are well. Just be patient, you...
Okay, who are you going to talk to?
Come on, wait for Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
You've been very patient with us.
May God help you.
Abu Walid's condition is not good.
I caught him, my sister. He's burning up, shaking and trembling.
Because the deadline is about to end.
Five days are left for it.
He loses all his money on him.
May God be sufficient against him.
Which one is better, turn me, turn me, turn me.
I hope it gets better.
This is a strange fever.
The text above is gibberish.
The second text under the mall is not moving.
My fever has left me at fifty percent.
Giving me a discount.
Don't worry.
I hope all your affairs turn out well.
And my sister didn't fall short.
She said she's waiting for her money a bit.
May God reward her with good.
I got rid of your sister, but
Our manager appeared to me. May God help us with our manager.
It seems our boss heard.
God knows what this manager intends to do to me.
I'll get it from him or from Bu Fahad.
Oh God, I swear to God, it's a problem.
And tomorrow is the last day.
He's wasting my money.
May God not show us.
Towards the brain, towards the brain.
Where can you find the strength to speak?
You, bring the phone, let's see who's calling.
Brother Abu Walid.
I'm calling you because you broke my heart.
Just stay on standby by the phone.
Goodbye.
You have always been a committed person.
We used to hold you as an example.
Don't think that I am unaware of your daily departures from work.
I am able to deduct from you.
What's the deal with this phone? / What's up with this mobile?
Instead of deducting from you, I am...
I put you on the inventory committee.
Are you going with them today for the inventory?
And I and you, don't you go out of work?
And if I came out.
Don't blame me after that.
The poor guy, today is the last extension for him.
My phone is broken, my mom's phone is also broken, he's waiting for them to call him.
I'm afraid he'll get fired from work.
Oh Abu Walid, my phone is the one that rang.
It breaks the heart / It's heartbreaking.
May he go, poor thing.
Oh, Abu Walid.
Hey, good news.
What's wrong with you, Abu Walid? No, I'm calling you, not the phone.
Go finish your paperwork.
And don't worry.
You're not falling short, I swear to God.
It seems that Abu Fahd is at work.
What do you want me to do for you?
This is a big responsibility.
Where is he going?
Come on, Uzbekistan!
My brother, which direction is Uzbekistan?
Uzbekistan, third office on the right.
I don't cough.
Wait, Bou Fahd.
Do not sit.
Don't look at me.
Or do you want?
House house
Forward!
Guys, the real is down.
Do you know how much I think I have now?
And all these years, this is you.
I brought papers and I'm bringing papers.
My ride fell.
Wandered and walked between these ministries.
But we were young.
Here's what I see in front of you. I'm a sack of rice. I put it on my shoulder like this, like I'm carrying plaster for kids.
And God willing, may God keep you safe. God wanted, I learned to ride the bicycle.
Especially after the failure that I learned from and bought.
Really, it's an olive green.
And they flirt with me when I ride the bicycle, oh my!
Making a living and raising children.
The manager has arrived.
When I finish, God willing, we'll have a treat.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Okay, you're threatening to fire me.
I testify that you, O Bu Saeed, did not fall short.
Now I want rest, my brother, oh well, goodbye.
We are ready.
Don't you want us to extend your contract for another year?
That's it, that's it.
May God reward you with goodness.
You extended my four years.
Otherwise, I should have been retired a long time ago.
The kids all went to work.
The last one yesterday was at work.
He's back now, Abu Abdulaziz.
I'm looking for comfort.
No, and your job is messenger.
Ala Khanfaroush Tayeb Aye
I still can't believe it.
I haven't tasted "khanafaroush" for maybe four or five years.
Yeah, it's good on him.
I smell it in my nose.
Everything you order will happen, God willing.
Please get me the Human Resources department.
You finished the papers.
Yeah, since yesterday.
Your transaction will be delayed if you do it this way.
Dude, I'm bored.
That's enough.
Don't cut us off again.
Hello, father Khaled.
From this moment on, that's it.
God willing, we will rest, father, we will rest, oh my, yes.
Sweet sweet.
I'm at work and I can't leave.
You can pass by the General Administration in Human Resources.
I have a transaction there.
I want you to take it and take it to the Civil Service.
May God bless you, father. You never fall short.
Where are you going?
My yacht is raining, I have to go to the bank.
And she invited all of us.
Now.
The bank is waiting for me.
Herd it with someone.
No, Dad, I can't leave work.
Okay, okay, let's go, goodbye.
He didn't agree, did he?
He says he can't come out.
What are you doing now?
Tomorrow morning, while I'm coming, I will pass by the bank.
A learner who has been studying for all these years, attends.
He must be feeling annoyed.
This is better for him.
You're letting him rest, then?
The poor guy is happy that he's going back home.
He called me and told me that Khaled
He sent him a message so that he would finish his transaction.
Fear God.
Everyone is on their own.
My mom regrets making the khanafrosh.
Will it not spoil, Mom?
I'm not regretting the khanafrosh, oh my mother.
But I'm saying, since he left work and abandoned it...
Khaled is going and he will take care of it.
Lying in his room.
The ones who got lost in their sea.
Good morning, father.
Hello, my daughter.
Dad, I swear to God.
But they called me and said the manager is very angry.
Here's your treatment.
Hello, Um Saeed.
I told you, let the kids rely on themselves. What's wrong with you? Don't you hear what's being said?
The war, unless you retired.
Yah, and upon him is Ali.
Here I am, waiting for you, and the jellyfish is in front of me.
Today we will eat it.
Okay, goodbye.
Sorry, Dad, I forgot to tell you.
My dear beloved, my dear.
May God help you.
Yes, the one near the market.
You, get out of here quickly.
You came out, my daughter, you came out.
We seek refuge in Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God bless you.
Zain, I deleted the house.
ails ails ice
I told you to stay home.
Teach your children how to manage themselves.
What am I going to do, O happy one?
Their circumstances are difficult. I am compelled to help them.
خلاص, خلاص, ارتاح
And I'll bring you a glass of water.
And I will bring you khunfaroosh to eat.
The poor thing is dizzy.
And from the taxis.
And on him, on his face.
The branch in the market is gone.
And they want the personal ID card.
After she gets into her car.
Take the papers to him.
Thank God, Dad, thank God.
Everyone depends on himself.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
May God's blessings be upon you, Jana.
Great lunch, don't miss it!
I'm going from ministry to ministry, following up on government transactions.
He went from ministry to ministry.
Behind the kids' transactions.
You treat them like adults and you treat them like children. It's true that you're spoiling them.
The kids are holding good, important jobs.
Their time is crowded, what can we do?
Every day, except for a meeting with the manager, or with the, meaning, the big boss, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, but when they need them for work, oh my!
And you wander off, and in order to complete your transactions and to struggle, to run, and to have a second job, you get stuck in it, it makes you a mercenary, sitting, how else?
May God reward you now.
Okay, I'm coming with peace.
Oh God, forgive us then, oh oh Bushahin.
They already called me and told me it's done.
If you send your father tomorrow, he will finish the transaction for you.
That's why I'm going to be very late.
Fear your Lord.
Tomorrow is impossible, tomorrow in particular I can't.
From his love for you.
He is annoyed and tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair on his head.
There's a guy who fell in the room and it's been two days.
From this driving around in the streets and from this sun.
May God give you the treatment.
And go run and save it for him.
The committee comes from morning until late afternoon.
You heard me, Mom.
My building will be delayed, good.
As long as tomorrow is your last day and committee.
Your transaction is required to be completed tomorrow.
If not, then come at night and complain to me about them.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow that he is obligated to attend.
What's up, Dad?
His tear is in his eyes.
I didn't actually lie to my dad.
The committee are the ones who changed their minds.
And they said they will come by the end of the week.
Okay, tell your dad.
Oh father, don't go.
I'm going to the committee and I haven't come.
I'm not sitting here showing off in this cafeteria with these trashy girls.
She's laughing at him.
Okay, fine.
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm going to him.
Thank you, father.
Khuloud, my daughter.
He's definitely mistaken.
And it turned out he was selfish after all.
What made you tired that day when the committee didn't come?
You are goodness and blessing.
From today and going forward.
We handle our transactions ourselves.
Tils is at home.
Here's your head, I'll kiss it.
Hello hello hello my dear father.
May God grant you a good morning.
Oh dearest father.
In the whole world.
Mawl, I don't want you to be upset.
And I don't get annoyed.
And you, just like I told you.
I wonder when I will finish this transaction for them.
I wish to finish it myself.
And they told me, "Come quickly."
You have a meeting.
With His Excellency the Minister.
Make her happy for a moment, father.
I have a problem with these adults.
Oh my joy when they said your son is with the W, woe is him, this is it.
Rely on God, go to your work, they will tire you out.
Bos3eed, where are you?
May God keep you safe, father.
Here's the translation: **"That envelope is right in front of me, Dad."**
You just pass by, and I will send you the envelope with the messenger.
My dear father.
He means he didn't sign it.
It seems he forgot.
Because the committee will meet after an hour.
May God keep you safe.
My son has a meeting with the minister today, oh woe!
Give me just the transaction.
This is my condition, from work to the door, and from the house to work.
No, where I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace. Please come in, sir. Please come in.
No no no, I didn't kill him, I didn't kill him, nothing.
Someone from a week ago, classified, will go to the mainland.
And they tell you, "Mahiyas is there at the farm."
The morning is gone.
He's taking it easy there, of course.
And I'll give you more than that.
They say his cooking is so good, it doesn't need anything else.
And I will go to him.
Goodbye.
Hope everything is alright.
Hope everything is alright, uncle.
May God guide you.
No, Dad, I'm not feeling well, I'm not feeling well.
Your papers were scattered.
That one is at the camp.
This is from the abundance.
Treat her like a friend.
I'm thirsty, father. I wanted some water.
Bring me my water.
My dear children.
No no just scratch it out scratch it out I don't want it
Don't write like this.
I make them confused.
Woe is me, my sister.
And you're right.
No no, I killed him.
Yes, by God, my sister.
Allow me, my sisters.
What they call the League and the Cup.
And he kept talking about the rule.
I don't know what this boy is saying, what he's talking about, and what he's bringing up.
And they caught it on him, we're not talking nonsense, we're not talking nonsense.
The people started ignoring him.
They bring him some talk and tell him to speak on the radio and television.
And what's more than that.
Take him, grab him my brothers, and throw him in jail.
Believe me, my sisters.
Oh, my dear girl, these days no one can help anyone else.
What does he have to do with the problems?
I swear, if he dies now
I won't let him talk, and according to what he said, we've had enough nonsense.
Thank God for his safety.
Blessing has visited us.
Goodbye.
I'm going to be late for work like this, oh my.
Listen, Dad.
I spent the whole night awake yesterday.
And I warn you.
Right now, I just wanted to remind you, Dad.
That's enough, Mom.
Impossible, he contacted me again.
No radio, no TV, even Qtel is not connected.
Your sister Aisha is miserable. It's been two days.
And Munira, your fiancée, her tears are flowing profusely down her cheeks.
Shame on you, father. Have mercy on us, and may God have mercy on your parents.
Like you said.
We've had enough nonsense.
I don't care if you get annoyed.
Here's the translation: Your uncle, Bu Amnayrah.
Here's the translation: **"After they put you in prison..."**
And he said, "Enough."
Uncover the bride.
Here is the English translation: Following a visit, oh father, his gift fell with him. I told him to seek refuge from Satan, and God willing, nothing but good will happen.
The second time, he will grab you by your hand and take you to court. He divorced his daughter.
That's enough, Mom.
Repentance, I swear.
If you call the radio or the television, don't blame anyone but yourself.
I told you, repent.
Let me go now.
Between you and me, that's just talk.
The manager told me.
We don't want him here.
This person will go and mess things up for the administration tomorrow.
What's wrong with us? We've had enough of this nonsense.
Okay, now what will the manager say to him?
Oh, he has a million excuses he can give.
Where should I go?
That's it, I'm done.
I miss you.
Hello, yes.
Goodbye.
I told you.
You know, Saleh, I told you why.
The public interest has compelled us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
Your words are right, but
Please, just one, we've had enough nonsense.
Sweet of you.
We've had enough nonsense.
Yes, indeed.
You're still here.
We have work, please.
What a disaster, Dad.
Layn, manage things.
Here's the translation: **"Oh, I missed
I didn't tell you they're going to fire him.
And Munirah was standing and listening when I told you.
Yeah, Dad, I said.
I heard them with my own ears, I just came from the majlis.
My soul, now you are inside.
And let me negotiate with your father.
The prison shower incident, we said it was a mistake and we kept quiet.
We'll be quiet now, after they finish him off.
Just because we are family.
You know how.
Seek refuge from Satan.
And God willing, nothing will happen but good.
Remember God, may God guide you.
I don't want to have coffee, keep your coffee to yourself.
I know you.
Bored.
Your uncle has given you two weeks grace period.
I swear, he won't grab you by the hand and take you to court to divorce.
Even if I go out, Mom...
What do you have to do with troubles?
Just push yourself.
Even if someone tells you
Tune yourself to what you hear.
This is not just our mess.
Yeah, man, that's it.
But don't punish me these days.
What's the big deal? We're tired of this nonsense, man. We really want to hear it from you, just once. Just once.
No, that's it.
So you are the police.
No, Mom, you've got it all wrong.
My cousin had a problem, so we asked him to speak on the radio tomorrow.
He was a little hesitant.
We felt that we had spoken to him in a public place, so he hesitated.
I said, "It's my right as my cousin's husband to have a house, and to talk to him privately is better."
You felt that he wanted to say something.
It means hesitant, and he doesn't want to, and he doesn't want to.
They came from somewhere, they didn't just appear.
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.
I am not your mother and I don't know you. I disown you until the Day of Judgment. Do you hear me or not?
Saleh Saad
Here, you go.
You have a sense of responsibility.
And an example of a successful employee.
But unfortunately.
Although I tried.
Peace be upon you.
Why did you tire yourself and come?
I just called the secretaries to inform you not to come.
Shaheen, what's wrong with you?
You didn't know who this was.
Oh man, is there anyone in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh? Enough with the nonsense.
You're good, but enough with the nonsense.
We've had enough nonsense.
Yeah, the job.
But there are no jobs, I mean, you know the circumstances, I mean.
Damn, man, why didn't they hire him?
I'm crazy, should I work for us?
I swear to God, Mani, I didn't go anywhere.
Nobody told me that five minutes before you came, there was a job but they filled it, meaning it's gone.
My sister Aisha, yesterday her husband divorced her and
My responsibility has become this big.
After becoming responsible, it became this big.
I swear I don't know what to do, I swear.
He is getting closer to the minister.
But honestly, I found it unfair.
He thinks I'm afraid he'll replace me.
That's enough, you're killing me.
Who told you I will be silent?
But I just want this method to be far away from me.
I'm thinking of a way to slaughter him.
You finish it all at once.
But what is it?
I know him.
That's not the one who talks on the radio.
I'll take you to the sitting room.
And you're just a mouthful of information.
You, Saleh, are a citizen full of patriotic spirit.
You are a patriotic citizen.
You're welcome.
I swear, I'm done.
I consider your voice to be like the voice of truth.
I also spoke with him a little, Bou Fahd.
Really, Saleh?
Someone is saying they haven't heard this in a long time, and this is what they say, "Enough with the nonsense."
I really want to get to know him.
This is normal, Saleh.
I am a fighter in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward!
And people like you are few.
Your words are very beautiful.
And your voice on the radio sounds much better.
We heard only one, but we got nonsense.
Okay, come on, just one more, because of Bu Fahad. He's there right now, he's going to say it, he's going to say it. Listen, listen, listen, listen.
We've had enough nonsense.
This is the original, may you live long. This is it.
I asked you to keep going, not to stop.
It's a little difficult.
Then he stopped, it's okay.
Maan, I wish you would continue because of people's problems and their cases.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem, but that's it.
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
I want you to get up a little.
This is a high-ranking official.
Come on, man, just say "done," say "yes," I swear.
Yes, indeed.
This is your chance.
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
No, no, it means...
What's wrong with you? Don't you understand?
Please be patient, my brother.
From problems, calamities, and these things.
Your Excellency the Minister.
The ministry, in its latest project, ordered eight thousand tubes.
This appears to be a string of
But this employee
Agreed upon capacity pipes.
So he can benefit from the price difference.
We've had enough nonsense.
You didn't fall short, you didn't fall short, oh brother Saleh, enough with the nonsense.
May God keep you safe.
This call is a special request.
God willing, you will name him "Yes."
We're done with nonsense, we're done with nonsense.
Do you know?
Life and what it does to you.
That's the last one, and that's it.
Sultan flew with Asdiq.
Is the minister really moving that fast?
They say he spoke the truth.
Okay, now the arena is empty for Abu Fahad, he will play alone.
I am doing all the tasks.
Yes, of course.
Present was the minister's saa (a type of attendant/courier).
Goodbye.
We've had enough nonsense.
That's it, this is the last one, after this...
Oh, and this, may you live long, are my papers for the job. Forgiveness, kidding.
It means what they wanted, they reached.
Listen to me.
Because he is afraid.
I'll talk about him and reveal his scandals and misdeeds.
You're the one finding faults and criticizing.
Do they fear you?
Deceive me, my sister Aisha.
You're the good one.
Tomorrow your uncle Abu Amirah will come.
The condition is that I work.
They have no idea what they're talking about, those who criticize and point out flaws.
Why do they harbor resentment towards our country?
Do we have any flaws?
We don't have any connections.
This is my first time hearing the word "wasta".
In our government departments, you go in order.
We don't have bribery.
And we don't know her.
And look at the employee.
Do we have the foreigner taking more than the son of the country? No, no, no, never.
We do everything with our own hands.
You are a son of, your mother is a daughter of, your father is a son of. We never have a Sayyidah.
It's better for you to be responsible while you're on the job.
We are the best people.
The best country.
Flawless.
And thank you.
I heard nonsense on the radio yesterday.
Mom, I want candy.
I told you there's no candy until after dinner.
Fine, then there will be no candy.
What tore the shirt?
Mom, me and Adol were sitting playing.
I know you're playing.
But what tore the shirt?
May God curse you, you scoundrel.
Come, come see what your evil nephew has done.
Here is the translation of the text into English: "I told you there's no need to buy it, it's expensive. You told me no, it's okay, it'll look good on a boy."
Look what he did.
It's no longer possible to cancel this. This shirt is already canceled, it's no longer possible to wear it.
He said I'll do what I want with it, of course, no one will use it.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look at the split in the workforce on purpose, he said.
He returned with Walid.
He's happy with it. It's the first time he's wearing it.
I'm in a maze.
Where is Adul?
In the garden.
What's happening?
I need him for a topic between us.
I'm not pretending.
Get some shame.
You put your business and the child's business.
And the child is left to do as he pleases.
Ransacking, plundering, wreaking havoc.
No, come discipline me.
Come teach me.
We will definitely raise them.
About the excessive mistake and respect yourself.
Let him go away from you.
You're fighting like kids.
Gulf, far away, my mother.
Mother, don't you ever interfere.
Tell him to raise his children properly. Listen, you and him...
Is this a baby?
Damn you, where are your eyes? Aren't you leaving, distinguishing between the child and the adult?
But I found out.
The blame is on me, not on you.
Let's go upstairs.
These people don't deserve someone.
Even that I would respond to them.
It's better for one to
The time of calm hearts.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm coming, coming, coming, goodbye, goodbye.
But, your age, the minister is asking for the papers and it's necessary to sign them.
Okay, okay, I will discuss with the minister later, okay, you have nothing to do with it, I will discuss with him.
The calamity has dried up. The disaster has dried up. The catastrophe has dried up.
His new dress, no, Aisha.
This is not a verb, child.
You're right on the nail.
No no, the weather is ruining the clothes, they're getting ruined.
Goofy Goofy
It means there is no hope that you will wear it.
Jufi sarwal adwal ya'ani yilbis rhil wahida wa yutla'.
La la la no, this is not, this is not a cut by hand, I show.
I tell you, look, it's like with an electric saw.
But all I can say is, may God take revenge on the one who did this.
I'm telling you.
Whoever wants candy, come here.
Me too, I know.
If you also know, come on, take a tour around the desert.
I don't just love you because you know how to ride a bike.
I love you because there is something else about you too.
Are you telling the truth, right?
Okay, do you want candy?
Yeah, Dad, two.
I'll give you four units.
Who is the one who cut our clothes in the closet?
Here's the translatio
He has huge scissors that he uses to cut cars with.
Under the bed, here are all the candies.
You wouldn't believe the lengths this one goes to.
Nobody else caused this mess but him.
Why should we keep silent about it?
The most important thing.
That we insist on our words.
Whoever tears clothes is a child, Walid.
Any computer.
Why is he sitting and talking like this?
What I saw with my own eyes is impossible. Oh people, who would do this?
Why don't you want to believe me?
Go find your friends, go.
Zain, give me just a moment.
This is your state.
Every day, Mom, you argue.
Where are you, oh first time?
May God grant us pardon and well-being.
Oh God, guide you.
He can carry scissors that big.
You're the one I'm looking for among your friends.
Look at the scar, Mom.
I'm going to get scissors as big as.
Respect yourself, Sultan. Respect yourself, Awwash.
Oh father, come here please, for the sake of your parents, find a solution for them, come here father.
How do I start?
And each and every one of you.
You are fathers.
And the child is born.
A child is born.
You are my brothers.
Listen to my words and reconcile. Extend your hands.
Okay, tell me what are you going to do now?
What's the big deal? I tore their clothes.
What are their clothes worth compared to this calamity that he brought upon me? He wasted all my files, my information, my documents. He wasted everything.
I swear I won't leave him.
Bring us a museum curator who speaks classical Arabic, I swear I won't let him go.
Don't mind him.
Knock knock knock knock knock until he gets tired and leaves.
My brother is not sober, and I know him.
And everyone greeted each other.
My father, it's not from his heart. His heart is filled with resentment and hatred.
Here I am, defeated, because I broke the computer.
With Fahd.
Sultan, give him, give him, give him.
Just a moment, my dear. Fear your Lord.
Give him some, be careful, be careful.
Take it easy, your uncle's kids, and go play outside.
Oh God, oh God, may God guide you to righteousness.
May God bless you.
Men, each one as tall as a palm tree.
What did you leave for the seeds, what did you leave for the children?
God willing, my mother.
Their brother, Abdulrahman.
Maybe, my dear, it was the first time.
Do you know, my dear mother, this old man?
He knows how to talk to people.
And he understands them.
You guys too, don't get upset with me.
You are supposed to
Each one has a role.
May God guide you, may God guide you.
Even you, father, have become like them.
Ya Yama Yama, save my son! Oh, how God commands us! May God guide you, and you say, "move, move, move."
Go away, Mom, yeah.
My son is bleeding to death.
You disgraced us, you kids.
The kids who were deleting were the kids.
He's not willing to believe.
I see them with both my eyes.
We tell the kids, they won't believe this.
He says from above.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Look, he's driving a car from above, a Ford, just because he's driving from above, he thinks he's older."
Well, I'm not drugged, I'm sober.
Please go ahead, you can go.
You might be a little tired, or your head is spinning.
Do you know who these people are?
Are you saying they are coming to throw stones at you?
Imah S
My love.
I'll tell you to go and rest now. They signed a commitment, that's it, what more do you want?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
What is this, oh my goodness, hurry up!
May God be sufficient against the enemy.
Oh my mother, oh my mother.
It's all your fault.
It's your fault.
You are great, but you are young. Shame on you and your minds.
And they took me to the hospital, I'm fainting, I'm dying.
I saw him and it's not the first time I saw him.
And another observation is that he doesn't take his eyes off you, you hazy one.
Here, it wasn't registered in the business with us.
But now he has been attending the course with us for a week.
It's so obvious that he's dying to get to know you.
Don't become annoying just because someone likes you that much.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to say that I threw myself at him.
A rich kid tried to impress me and acted like he was interested in me.
Let things become natural, it's better.
Here he is the one chasing you and he is the one throwing himself at you.
That means, right, I reciprocate the same feeling of admiration.
But I don't know, I still feel like the right opportunity hasn't come yet.
But in terms of percentages.
I'm damaged and I look at you like this, and how is the water?
Or else, wait, young man, for her to come and tell you, "Excuse me, I would like to get to know you."
My brother, be the one who takes the initiative.
You're right.
But I am waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity.
More than the fact that you are registered with her in the same subject.
The teacher said.
Tell her, O so-and-so.
Hey, so-and-so, come here. Is it true, what's her name?
We've been staring into each other's eyes for three months now.
And no one knows the other.
My brother, you are from the old days, you are.
You have to go and tell her, "Excuse me."
Can I get to know you?
It's not that strong, not to that extent.
I have to wait for the right opportunity to come to me.
Calm and well-mannered.
I swear I don't know what you want exactly.
We finished filming the series yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
You never forgot us, and you never fell short with us.
Now that I'm free, what should I do?
That we buy the villa behind us, this one belongs to Walid.
May God willing, if he gets married, he will stay with us, he will not go far away from us.
What's the point now, anyway?
You're very late.
And you are the best of news.
A few days ago, I saw her door open, empty of her belongings.
And they bought the villa through the Development Bank.
May God bless them, God willing, in it.
Hello hello father good morning
Hey man, start the car.
Thank you, father. Thank you. May God reward you. May God reward you with goodness.
Hey hey Noura, come in, come in, it's hot outside. The car is working. Good news, come, I'll give you a ride. Come, come, Dad.
And upon you be peace.
What's up?
Neighbors sitting and talking to each other, what's it to you?
I say, get out of here, it's better for you.
Neighbors sitting together, what's it to you?
I have a kind brother who blocked my car and I can't get it out.
Please, please, give me your car key.
After turning off the car.
I'll leave you in the Titanic atmosphere that you're living.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Now you know a lot of things about me.
And I only knew Walid.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Of course, many people, if you tell them your father's name, they will think you are the son of the actor.
Mashallah, same name.
My dad is actually Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father.
Why didn't you have dinner with them? Did anyone have dinner? Those vile cats.
Come here, let me tell you something.
How did you know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, our neighbor?
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
My friend at the university knows them, and she is the one who told me.
Here, he loves him and loves his acting, and he's the only one who follows him.
He told me we no longer live next to someone famous who has value in society.
Oh my heart, oh my joy!
He's cool, he's cool, he's light-hearted, yes indeed.
Oh, his son turned out to be a good driver like him. He helped me, may God reward him with goodness.
Believe those who said.
Did you all return?
I have to take a picture with this actor that I love, you know why.
Mom, Haj attacked, talk to Abboud, my aunt's son.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He says they are filming a series about the days of pearl diving.
I'm asking who you brought, a sheep for me, on the occasion of the new villa.
Prove that he is a good neighbor.
Hey Saleh, is there anything new?
We also came up with many names.
They told me, may God keep you safe, the group, oh Abu Saad, my name is listed.
And it is determined based on the need and the employee's experience.
We don't know.
We might not be able to move you.
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.
May God defeat your enemy.
We decided to move and settle before this, and when God provides for us, then we will furnish.
Fix your work.
He is back, O Abu Ali.
Please don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need.
I am at your service.
Neighbor for neighbor, and I am your brother.
But now I have heard and seen.
Nice, Mashallah, you know furniture.
Okay, I'll go with you.
You don't have to, my sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father has applied for a loan, and if they approve it, we will change all the furniture.
Here I am repeating it again.
What Erdog does is just the tongue.
We are like family today.
And this Hajja, she doesn't know how to teach on her own.
But I just want her to be independent.
I must have been speaking it.
So you want me to lie to you and tell you that I'm talking to my friend?
Oh my mother, oh Ali.
I'm not for anything.
Since she loves me and I love her, I will understand her.
You're dreaming.
Let me arrange a marriage for you with your cousin.
Leave it to me.
As you wish.
Your man will betray you.
Banjov
Good night.
And you are one of them.
Bou Ali is good.
Hey brother, this car is totaled.
Every other day, you make an issue for me.
The girl, may God keep you safe, has university.
And this one is always complaining.
Your daughter is our daughter.
It's nothing. / You're welcome.
There's no need for you to go out of your way for me, my brother, O Rashid.
May God keep you safe.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle without any work.
Development Bank is empty, they didn't fall short, they bought you a house and a car.
This isn't our car.
Car neighbor's house Rashed Abdullah
Hollow relationships have evolved.
We discuss topics of mutual interest that are beneficial to both parties.
Oh, a terrible development, Hazie.
Come on, let's go.
Oh my, that's embarrassing.
The input
Noura said, "I considered my daughter, and every day the driver would take her to university."
Did you tell her that my father's car needs a week for repair?
No, by God, never.
She said, "No, the driver every morning delivers her."
To be honest with you, Umm Ali.
Good people.
La La La, oh father.
There is no power nor strength except with Allah.
Oh, what a mess, what a mess. What am I going to do now?
What am I going to do? I have responsibilities behind me.
My daughter, who will take her to the university?
Oh Abu Ali, as long as your reference is Professor Rashid Abdullah.
We can't say anything anymore, that's it.
Boussad Boussad
Bou Saad, I'm sorry.
Bou Ali knows his worth to us.
Thank you, may God reward you with goodness. You did not fall short, oh Bos3a.
They all love you, mashallah.
This is beautiful, this is beautiful.
Guys, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Apologies apologies Mr. Rashid, we made you late or something.
At your service, ready, ready.
You're so lucky, you have strong connections.
We are your friends and brothers. If we want something, take good care of us. Don't forget!
Just tell me where you want it, and I'll bring it to you.
I don't understand what you're saying. It's not clear and I can't make out the words or their meaning.
You're proposing Manal to me.
They agreed, mother, they agreed.
Manal told her mother about me.
What's wrong with you? I can't believe it.
Um Walid
And dresses, do you have a party?
I didn't understand.
May it be true, Walid, God willing, the apple of my eye.
She called me back, poor thing.
Takes accessories.
Accessories, jewelry, why not?
This is my mother.
Now you're going to ride a fancy car.
Mashallah Mashallah
Mashallah, I can't achieve.
Um Walid, you see, I didn't become with you.
Despite everything she has given you, she even gave you the car.
And with her is the driver.
Here's the English translation: "So, if I go with you and wear this color, they won't believe that this balding, weathered old man is the husband of this queen."
Oh my God.
And God willing, you will go in these clothes of yours.
Haha, no, no, no, no, no, oh dear, you poor thing.
Without my clothes, I'll leave you. You won't recognize me.
They say, who is this sheikh who suddenly came to us?
Coffee for the long-lived one.
Boo Ali, I didn't recognize you, I swear. I said, this one must be one of the big shots coming to us. You're not Boo Ali.
What's your opinion?
And the walk is different too.
May God keep you safe, these are the ones we will go to ask for the hand of Ali's bride from them.
Big people.
I managed to get myself from the mental hospital to the car.
I said for sure I will find it with you.
The last series that I acted in.
In a scene that was a wedding, I remember any wedding.
You were wearing that black abaya, shining.
And after your father, do you teach me how to wear the bisht?
Because your brother, may God keep you safe, has never worn a bisht.
Mashallah, you are radiant, radiant.
That's how it should be when I enter the majlis to greet the people.
This is not fair.
I'm telling you, my brother Rashid.
What else do you have after the buttons?
Goodness.
The one I always see with me, myself, and Kholoud.
The story is like this, meaning...
You are my love.
We are family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to go far away.
Noura is Walid's right (property).
Egoley, my dear, I see her at the university, and I can't find anyone better than her.
This is a blessed hour.
God willing, I will tell her father, and may God write what is best.
Why was he refused? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Go call your father.
Quickly tell him that Rashid wants you.
Where are you, oh...
I scream from the oppression.
Are you saying it's because his father is an actor?
Don't you have any shame?
I am an actor.
But I represent with honor.
I act on stage for two hours and my role ends.
And my acting ends.
You play roles.
I am acting.
I offer them a message that will benefit them.
As for yo
I'm wearing my acting clothes.
On stage.
As for yo
You acted like a fool in the majlis.
The provided
Who is the actor among us?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Walid.
Hold your head high.
We are not honored.
Did you miss the view now as I was coming?
And listen to her, screaming at him, "Don't turn around, don't turn around!" Poor thing, he breaks the heart.
And his master walks.
You say it's like a horse's paradise.
It's Thursday, man.
This is
His wife is not sane.
She's jealous of him.
That's why it's going like this.
So that he doesn't see women and women don't see him.
Did you see how his wife drove him crazy?
Sida, don't look back.
But tomorrow I won't show him in the office.
Khamis, please, please show them how he's dressed in the city style.
Khamis showed me his ladylike attire.
Isn't your wife right? You call her "my old lady."
Come on, it's already Thursday.
I'm going to see Salim Ashibi.
Poor guy, man.
How long will you continue to be like this?
If you could hear the things people say about you behind your back.
No, mashallah, even in front of me they say maybe even more.
Why am I doing this?
Do you get jealous over me?
Jealous of what?
Sometimes I sit in front of the TV.
This is it.
Yes, I swear to God.
No no it's okay.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
I dried up now.
As if right now, in front of you, I'm arguing with her, and I heard a man's voice.
Sometimes, I swear, I just want to strip off my clothes right there on the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
It's difficult for me to divorce her.
There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
I don't get close to myself, I don't get close, stay.
Here's the
My intention is good.
You are arguing with whom.
No one is ruining you except for these types of people you hang out with.
Especially this one, I'm talking about this one among all your friends. I can't stand him, I swear to God, this chubby, plump one.
By the one whose mustache looks like recently sprouted plants.
Someone with a lot of shame, who doesn't feel ashamed.
Do you want to torture me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
What do you have to say?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I haven't seen anyone here.
Salem, what's wrong? What happened?
Khamis, our friend, is here.
He was sitting and talking to himself while looking at the wall.
No, I'm saying the limp in his head, it's jumping, jumping up.
This Khamees is a poor soul.
It seems like he's talking about his mother being in front of him, and he's talking to her.
May God be sufficient against his wife.
They say you have Khamees (Thursday).
Now he is busy, he has an international call, it's very far, even the line cuts off.
What's wrong with this message?
I say, may God help you, Khamis.
What's wrong with you, not sleeping?
I don't have a clue, I swear I don't know, it's not coming to me.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow.
with the delegation of women who are in the ministry
Possible, I mean.
May God guide you, just listen to me, Khamees.
These names are coming from the Minister's office.
And then come.
Why are you so afraid of her?
If I were arguing with Salim, I wouldn't have been afraid.
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding and crouching behind the water tank?
That's it, that's it.
As you see, read, read, the last number in the total, you have.
The last number, huh?
The last number you dialed after deleting the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name, oh womanizer?
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her the riddles of Salem.
Sloom is my friend at work.
You didn't believe me, brother.
And what are you wearing?
I intend to start diving.
I swear, my brother, she didn't let me wear clothes. She told me to go out like this.
Call F man.
My wife's father called.
Hajj Marti.
Tell her, "Brother, give me the pen, I'll give you the number."
Administrators, watch over each other.
That's just the way you men are.
You are a sly one like him, but I will show you.
If you interfere a second time, nothing will stop me except the Minister's office.
This is Ace.
And you are threatening me, saying that you will complain about me in the Minister's office.
That's bold, all right.
This one is planning to cut off my livelihood, you know.
But I am the one who is wrong for listening to you and calling her.
Guff is back, Khamees.
If she complains about me to the Minister's office.
Come with me there and tell them the whole story. Get me out of the story, yeah.
I have nothing to do with it.
You're a coward.
My brothers and sisters.
May your mornings all be blessed.
I am honored by your attendance to listen.
Where are the rest, then?
He beat and fled.
It's Thursday, where is he?
May God grant you a long life.
He hung up the phone.
Okay, here's the translation: "No, don't close them, leave them in the office."
The whole meeting is just one hour.
This is not my phone.
It became and it happened, it became.
Since that day, he's been staying with you and hasn't gone back to his own home.
Where will he/she/it go?
He can't go.
From Zak today, he's sitting in the same state.
Jealous, jealous of me, she is jealous.
My love, this is not jealousy.
He sits here in the living room alone at night.
I'm going to talk with my mother.
My mother, my mother is dead.
That's why I brought you here, so you can find a solution for me.
Madam A, did she ask you to move from the department where women are?
Damn military rule, is it?
Here's the translation: "Look at Jufi's signature, it's huge. Read below."
My brother, please, I have been transferred to the Social Care Department.
Are you sure you're not transferred to the care department?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God keep you safe.
You are the sister, sorry brother Khamis.
Our office contacted the Minister's office and informed them.
Here you go, your new department.
And who are with you, your friends in the office.
Isa, Saleh, Jassim, and
Oh Khamis, yesterday the minister decided to transfer you.
And today, they caught you in your new department.
And I explained to you, I told you my problem with the family.
You are a transformed person by a decision of the minister.
That means I go to the minister.
Today he took his annual leave.
And he won't be back until a month and a half later.
That's a mess.
And you want my opinion too.
The minister, I'll tell you the same thing.
Continue until we find you a place, because this time I'm transferring you because many told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And the solution
Their saying: "If the woman contacts me, don't speak."
Maybe they will keep up with you, so beg them.
I made them put the abayas in the car for you. I put them in a cardboard box for you.
Just one.
I put you ten, on the basis that you are five in the office, meaning each one over two.
And it seems he's also afraid of his wife, he fears her.
Imagine, he named us all with men's names.
And I, they named me Abdul Ghader.
And it's called upon that.
He is handsome and sweet, meaning you should be worried about him like this.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Who did you say to call me?
Hey Abdul, the one sitting next to Hassan, who is sitting behind Khalil over there.
Here are the abayas, each woman chooses the one she wants.
Goofy, this one.
Farah Abkam Thi
What's wrong with you?
Please.
Where is the welfare office?
There are supposed to be five female employees.
What is your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife drives me nuts.
I am crazy.
You are now leaving the project in front of us.
We listened to them.
Okay, what did they tell you?
They said.
Munawwar, make us some jay when you have this.
I can't.
I just want to go into the kitchen and get myself into a mess.
Yalla, yalla, yalla, my soul, go make us some tea, yalla.
Come on, come on, come on, you idiot.
Come on, come on, listen to the men, listen to them.
Oh God, or did you forget that we are the sons of Aqrab (scorpion)?
Come on, come on, and I'm coming without thanks, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The bank said that the project is not controversial.
Call him, his phone is all busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you since a while ago.
And what do I have as a calamity other than this uncle and these brothers?
The maid left, supposedly for a month, but now it's been three months.
May God bless you, Oh Lord, goodbye.
And the amendments, my uncle, are all in our favor.
Give me the boy.
Yeah, but you see, if you do the garden...
At least he will go to a place, at least two or three villas.
They say that the garden is considered a breath of fresh air for the people who will live in this compound. This is the bank.
Men are discussing, they don't need women's opinions.
Let your opinion be known.
You put the tea, we found your back, go away.
A park no
Just a minute.
My sister, you know that I love football.
Your uncle and brothers don't know that you play football at school. If they found out, they would kill you.
What are you thinking about yourself?
She said it to you.
I say forget about the subject, it's better for you.
Don't look at yourself.
No no no no, I have a grudge against you.
What can I tell you? Life is full of things to do.
You are our blessing, I'm sorry.
Oh, Uncle Shaheen is here.
Mashallah.
This is Khamees.
Length and width.
The cuffs of the dishdasha.
I'm tired of looking for a wife for him and I haven't found one.
Lineage and ancestry.
I'm going to tell you something.
Khamis's wedding is at my place.
This is from the Human Resources Department.
Yes, may you live long.
Leave it aside.
She has a few comments on the proposal.
May you live long, my dear.
Do you have anything else?
May you live long.
Take care of them, and if I get some time, God willing, I will meet them.
What did you do about the female employees I sent to you?
What's wrong? / What's happening?
I'm going now and I'll call you later, okay?
What's happening?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
We've been suffering for a long time.
You know, they asked me, Fattoum, what sport does she play at school?
I told them table tennis.
They didn't slaughter it, that's good.
The hitting that's coming, this is just an appetizer.
You don't know who we are.
What is our origin?
Do you know what scorpions mean?
This time we messed up your face.
The Big Scorpion
Scorpion.
My uncle, let's give her a slap on her face.
That's enough of what she got.
You be a treasure for later.
You changed what you said, that you're going into architecture engineering like me.
You are my destiny.
Scorpions don't have girls working on the streets among men.
Engineering, architecture, and power.
Where do we take our faces among the scorpions, where?
Let me smash his head.
No no, oh Sultan, no.
Okay, old scorpion.
Tok, you broke Fatoum.
Let your brother Saqr take his chance.
It's a shame what they are doing.
Sorry, my love, at least you're capable.
My face is goofy.
Okay, why do they want you tomorrow morning?
Ashibon ba'ad.
Fly around, oh falcon, and descend.
Come on, in front of me, in front of me.
Where am I going?
Not a word.
Zain, where are we going?
We told J to shut up and not say a word.
And you write "education" instead of it.
And even nursing, if you want, we don't mind.
What else is new?
You had two options.
So you know that we are democratic.
What are you saying, that we pressured you?
Oh nursing, oh education.
Get out of here, you shameful person.
Bring us a copy of the request.
Get lost, get lost!
Oh, the big scorpion, oh father.
The old scorpion, by himself, proposed a marriage for you.
You're not being stingy, uncle, but when is the engagement party, God willing?
Ms. Amina.
What you're asking for seems very difficult to me.
I can't travel, Abu Khaled.
I have special circumstances.
This phrase is
It's very difficult.
Fikri, be fair, O Amunira.
Don't make a decision now, think about it, not tomorrow.
How come they let you work?
That's why we're quiet.
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you.
We don't have girls who travel.
Turki, I'm tired of this nonsense.
There is no life and no shame.
The best translation is: It's good of us to keep you at work until now.
Tomorrow you will go and apologize.
Jab, don't be hesitant.
Listen, and you be quiet.
Khamis is one of the sons of scorpions.
One of us.
Yes, he's an idiot and doesn't have a degree.
Just a scorpion.
My sister, what are you doing now?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
What can I do?
There is nothing I can do.
What did you expect her to do?
Next Thursday, God willing, the engagement party.
We will call you and tell you what time you should come to us, depending on the schedule of the sheikh who will officiate the marriage ceremony.
How sweet is that laugh!
Go get yourself some new clothes.
Go get some clothes made for yourself, father.
You're killing me with this laugh.
My brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Make us some tea, coffee, and cake.
Who is like you now, Aisha? Who is like you, the friend of the minister?
I'm afraid it might be a rumor, oh Abu Khaled.
Minister candidate holds a ministry in the new ministerial formation.
Amenira deserves it.
God willing, it's not a rumor.
Are you working tomorrow?
We all cooperate to serve the nation.
Thank you to each and every one of you for your contributions in your respective positions.
And I wish success for all of us.
Thank you, Madam Minister.
Thank you, the minister's wife, the minister's aide, the minister's daughter.
Thank you.
May God prolong her life, she is the best, the best.
Peace be upon you.
Yes, with soap, just like you told me.
This is the general supervisor of the women's national team's football team.
Ask him how your sister Fatima played.
In the name of God, God has willed it, God is the greatest.
Captain Fatima created two laws in the style of the great.
Captain Fatima is talented, my brothers. Goodbye, my son.
What do you think of my sister's play? What is her position?
Forward striker, that's it.
You are traveling to China.
Captain Jannah is a bit far in China.
May God grant you success.
Your sister is playing an important match.
This one was studying education, but today I went and transferred her papers.
She studied architecture with architects.
Hey captain, because there's no difference between a real man and a woman.
I swear, just pour the coffee, just pour it.
Come, where are you going?
I got tired of waiting.
Are you stupid, are you stupid?
Come on, come on, go say goodbye to your mother, tell her they kicked me out.
Come on, come on, your father and your mother.
That's just how it is.
The dallah you have got cold.
All year long, they don't care about you. You knew that, and as soon as they hear that you have a job,
Hello, how are you? How are the kids?
I missed her.
I told her, God willing, this time you will be with us in the series.
Of course, and she plays the leading role.
Go, Ali, look for Nouf. No one will play it except Shaoula.
My love, there's something called makeup that can make her look younger.
Maryam is 26, I don't know, 27 years old.
Let Shu'Aloh benefit, Dad.
He keeps giving us lectures that have neither beginning nor end.
I'm afraid we'll get a bone stuck in our throat.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know that the company that produced the series is your company and Hamid's.
God willing, I hope I haven't been late, my brothers.
Here's the translation: Rashid is behind me too.
The director is ready with his technicians.
Okay everyone, just because of time, let's start the meeting.
Whoever wants to speak, say their opinion, they are welcome.
Junk Hamid, do you want to say something?
Honestly, I don't think there's anything better than this series.
You came on the day I dried out on the day this maid committed suicide.
And you know the scene that affected me the most.
The maid's day to commit suicide.
The day her soul got stuck in the bank, the bank turned and turned and turned and turned, and the blood flowed and flowed and flowed down from her neck.
They found him and she started screaming at her son, I swear it was action.
And he sits down to shoot it, and shoot it, and shoot it until he reaches the courtyard of their house.
Peak action.
Okay, the police are searching and arresting the mother.
Honestly, the series is extremely wonderful.
All that's left is for you to act out the series, get up on the table, and act it out.
This is a rape of the artistic conscience.
And a rape of the values of society.
A series based on الشاذ events.
Unbelievable.
Case File 1972
What's with all the crying?
You're already known for not wanting anyone to leave.
Alright, alright, brother Hamed, let us be democratic.
We decide the subject by majority.
Brother Nasser, I don't hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy or majority.
You got involved, by virtue of your governmental position, in this affair.
Goodbye.
I tell you, I heard the doorbell.
And the day I went up, there was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
He asks me and says, "Are you Mama Hessa?" I said, "Yes."
Yeah, I opened the bag.
He found a ring in it, I think its value is around 70 or 80 thousand.
I'm afraid this Indian is bringing us these things by mistake.
No, Dad, it wasn't on purpose.
This is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the responsible person we have in the company.
And this, God bless you, is a gift from her to you.
What's wrong with you?
The ring is very luxurious.
I've never dreamed of having a ring like that.
May God keep you safe, my dearest Hessa, my love.
This is my father, this series, this is what I call the series of goodness.
Ali and Hamid are the business owners, but because they are our employees, it's not right for them to present the series in their own names. So they presented it in whose name?
And what else is there besides this ring?
I'll tell you, but the words won't come out. It will be between you and me.
What's wrong with me? I'm just telling someone.
My clever husband.
The one they call the magician.
What's with the five percent, it's a bit much.
No, my dear, they are good if they agree to give them four million.
Your husband is getting two hundred thousand nice riyals.
I suggest the role of the university girl, let's give it to Nada.
Enjoying a good time, you love someone and run away with them on a motorcycle.
Our series that we are working on after its name is "Rape of Conscience."
They contacted me about a role in a TV series.
Zain, I just want to know one thing.
Always like this, our Gulf series, meaning like we say, the trend this year is rape.
The important thing, tell me my love, what will be my role?
And you too, my love, your turn is 100% guaranteed.
Okay, enough about the embarrassment.
Come on, come on, come on, right now!
My love, my darling, I made you this wonderful breakfast, and you're leaving me to go?
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God help us.
He never asked me for this time.
He told him that this series they are doing is weak and trivial.
It's a waste to spend money on him.
Okay, and then, I mean, what happened?
God, I'm worried. What am I going to tell them? I'm afraid that Rashed, that idiot, has told them something inappropriate about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave this matter to me.
A sick person.
Social series
This is something I just saw a few days ago, being broadcast on television.
May you live long.
The series that is currently airing, its name is "Rape of a Rose Not Yet Picked."
But it seems like the budget they are requesting is too big.
It needs a bigger budget.
Then don't forget, may God protect you, that the institution producing the work is a local institution.
May God keep you safe, I asked about her hand.
Rest assured, your long life.
I read the technical page.
We hear these days about the start of filming the series "Rape of Conscience."
And that a huge budget has been allocated for it.
While it is said that the series is not up to par.
And another says that the series is a school for teaching deviance.
There is a big possibility that they will stop filming.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you. Hello hello Abdelhamid.
Hala hala wallah hayyak hayyak istaih
Good morning.
Good morning, welcome.
I am the journalist Eli Meir, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you please.
Okay, but he's just resting a bit because he has a meeting.
Mercury allows us to exploit the design and create a cosmic space.
And by the way, we will contact all the correspondents in the world so that they can contact us.
This is your job now, that's it.
For Mercury Art Production Company.
And discussing its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works that have passed in the history of the world.
Can you believe it? Who wrote this stuff?
If you have no shame, do as you please.
The eye is shy.
Is it possible that we have journalists like this?
The journalist is supposed to have principles.
You have it here.
What are they coming to record, stances?
I met yesterday, oh Shaoula, the minister's assistant. Do you know what he told me?
I tell you, our series is very emotional, very emotional, and its events are strange.
Tomorrow is the first episode and I will watch it with people.
Hey mom, what do you think?
Oh, come on, Mom, be patient. This is just the first episode.
A guy, I saw someone talking to himself, only in Gulf series.
And then I saw a mother saying, "I will slaughter my children if you don't have any."
Oh my son, art is taste, not الشاذ cases that you bring and تعميمها on society and people.
Mom, this might be in visual art, but in drama it's completely different.
Oh no, don't hit my head.
And it seems that the Turkish Ighldun
Don't judge it yet, Dad. At least watch the first five episodes.
The series is a failure.
And it's a shame to let our children see these things.
What's up with you, brother? It's not that bad.
There have been many series worse than this one and they were displayed.
Originally, this work, oh brother Salem.
This is your fault.
And what's in every house?
Go and gather the people who understand the dimensions and the subtleties of the lines.
Show it to them.
It's not for us.
What's happening?
The minister passed by, accompanied by guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We are the ones who approved the series.
What's up with that? Only those who please him are happy, minister.
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague is the one who posted the insult.
I only post messages that contain praise for the series.
No no, don't worry about it at all.
I will see what is written tomorrow, and I will post messages from myself. I will thank the series and praise it, and I will say that these readers sent these readings.
God willing.
You can only be happy.
For this year.
This one, we agree with him.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them, including the minister's messengers.
I'm walking with you, we agree with the journalists.
Headlines, headlines only.
I wish for the conscience to be raped again.
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series.
I wish they would repeat it again.
I was the first one they called from the Minister's office.
We have taken out the remaining balance of your series funds for you.
They're not wrong to call you "the charmer".
And you still haven't seen anything.
To be honest, we have now invested our money and made a profit. The profit was excellent.
And by the way, the series is a failure.
The author himself, I spoke to him, and he told me he regrets it.
I'm coming now. I suggest to you a second part of the series.
Minister, trust me, between you and me.
The story of the press and the illusory success we made passed by him.
And he told me, "I'm not comfortable with the series from the inside."
It means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part for us.
If the minister himself requests a second part.
I can't.
But I must reiterate my thanks.
To all employees.
In this series...
And I congratulate them on their victory.
What they deserve.
The truth is that the work winning these awards in these prestigious festivals.
It is the biggest proof.
How would I know? You're the one saying that.
You turned out to be no easy person.
The golden prize is guaranteed one hundred percent.
Ashkan says to you.
Readers, tell us: Do they deceive us? And the press, do they deceive us?
Why doesn't he tell them there's a second part?
As long as you have these TV festivals, the Arab TV and in the Gulf, you do an art washing.
Art Laundry
I hear about money laundering.
MBB art.
Illegal funds.
The same thing with series.
What are we going to do with "One Two"?
What are we going to do?
Didn't we sign a contract with them? They must adhere to it.
Write to them.
Our products are exported abroad, including Roti in its various types, and small, large, triangular, and assorted breads.
We are mute, we signed the contract with them.
Two million dollars.
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of the roti.
They asked you what product he is going to make.
They told me about the roti, but what is in the roti, how it is made, I don't know.
May God give you health, Roti in a jar.
You call it a zipper.
Instead of you taking this roti, which you call "samoon".
This is the inventor's thinking, to make it easier.
Roti Jeans
This is the secret.
You're eating roti with soosa.
Brother, they're doing really strange things.
This text appears to be in a dialect of Arabic, possibly Gulf Arabic. Here is a translation of the text into English: "This s*** (or "this sh*t"), its dough, its processing, is done in a way such that, the moment you put this s*** in your mouth, it melts."
And different flavors are equal: strawberry, Sesta, strawberry Sesta, Kajot Sesta, coffee.
Do you know how much I have invested in this project?
Three million dollars with patent rights.
Come, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
At your service, your Excellency.
We took her to the river today, my long-lived one.
What are you saying, Sameh?
Take them, your son Nasser took them yesterday to play magnetic football with the team that he formed.
I agree with him.
This team's manager, who caused us so much trouble, only cares about security guards and drivers.
And after, we are considered lacking because, oh my, we only have one guard. If he gets injured, we are in trouble.
And I'm supposed to have a fan club by now.
And you, when you took the employees who, according to your mother, were seventeen...
I told you something.
About the important people in the company.
Those who form the heart of the company.
Taking the baker for the hospital dough.
And all of it is miserable for the boy.
I told him, "It's shameful, it shouldn't happen. You're from a well-known family, it shouldn't happen that you go and run after a ball and make the world laugh at us."
He takes whoever he wants to play with, and he does whatever he wants.
But he doesn't take the important people who form the heart of the company.
What should I do, Mom? My team has a game, and I'm missing four players.
We don't want any excuses.
What happened, happened now.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I got in. I rode with him.
He told me to get dressed.
And they brought me and stopped me in the cell.
The match started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They tell me that if the ball comes, I should step on it, but I don't remember.
You mean, before you used to play as a goalkeeper.
Just for Nasser's sake.
There is no power nor strength except with Allah.
What has God afflicted us with through this ball and these nonsensical things?
From today, Nasser.
There is no such thing as football.
Your team, the one you made, cancel it.
All the bakers returned to the bakeries.
What do you think?
Dad, the subject.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I asked you, O Abu Nasser.
Let's hear what the boy has to say, please, I'm begging you.
Just for you, Abu Ahmed.
I see, tell me what's up.
Tomorrow we have the last match in the tournament that we are playing.
Don't break his heart, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you, please.
Okay guys.
Congratulations Congratulations
Good, good, good, congratulations.
Mr. Nasser, I need you for a minute.
May God bless you, my team today was on time.
Mr. Nasser must...
You promised to throw us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a ballroom for you at the hotel?
And at one time, I will make the journalists and newspapers come there.
No, Rashid, I will do it at our place in the majlis.
So that my father, when he sees the joy, the players, and the victory, might let the team continue.
They brought the cup! They brought the cup! They brought the cup! They brought the cup! They brought the cup!
May God hear you, but...
No, I saw pictures of him with the players and he did a press conference with them recently.
Waco, Sami, the editor of the sports page, is going to do an interview with him.
What picture?
I don't want him to go far away from me.
Come on, let's take a picture and see if it turns out right.
Yeah, you tell me you're not happy.
Here's a translation of the input text: **Your attachment to the victory of your sons, the bakers, I mean, the players, in this great rescue.**
With fighting spirit.
And the effort.
And loyalty to the bakeries.
بو ناصر يعني لامواخذه احنا شاهدنا فريق المخابز طول الدوره بيلعب بطريقه اربعه اربعه اتنين
And loyalty to the bakeries and his trained line.
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser.
May God keep you safe.
Here's the goalkeeper.
The translation of the input text is: They will come to do an interview with you, the ones who broadcasted the league and cup games.
No, that tail doesn't belong to the council.
Dell is sending their representative to meet with you.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
God willing, I testify that you will see him in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
Mashallah, your phone doesn't stop ringing and I'm taking your picture in the newspapers. Blessings upon you, this football.
You know what, he wasn't talking to me.
He came back down for us on the price of the machines. He told me, "Tamer, oh Abu Nasser, the ball is in your court."
Okay, now I've become famous, and the newspapers don't put your pictures unless they write underneath: "The first sports sponsor at International Bakeries."
I'm far from football.
What is this talk?
I have been like this since I was young, in middle school.
The person next to me was playing football.
Are you saying far from the ball?
As long as the person next to me is playing football, I am close to the ball.
It means I'm close to being athletic, meaning I'm athletic.
Based on this, we are no longer International Bakeries, we have become International Stadiums.
Yesterday I heard him say that he wants to make it a sports club.
Of course, today we meet the pioneers of sports in International Bakeries, Uncle Abu Nasser.
To develop football.
Of course, we talked to you before the match. We wanted to know your predictions, and before you reached the podium.
The game is difficult today.
And the team that controls the midfield will have the upper hand today.
God willing, we are currently in the process of contacting agents of professional players to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud, listen to me, take care, take care of business, and take care of it.
Listen to me, father. The deal that went sour, it was for the players, the shipment that came to us.
We didn't benefit anything.
Here's the translation: **"I'm the one who gave you the prices."**
Here are the prices we sell to the world.
How does the Gulf not compare to the rest of the world?
Of course not.
This is not your business.
You just have to let me know when a Gulf buyer comes along.
Keep your fax machine open.
Two defenders, one midfielder, and one holding midfielder.
Look, my dear, I'm telling you that these four players...
Three of them are the head.
Two hundred thousand.
Dollar, take them all, Juki, once.
How much do you get, six hundred thousand? I'll give them to you in a briefcase, five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Okay, now this is for the Africans, right? Now we're talking about the Brazilians.
This player of the season, this one alone is worth a million and two hundred thousand dollars.
They put this price, but after that, I got a fax showing it to you. Where is it? Here it is on top. Wait, let me see it. See, I got a fax. May God keep you safe from a club in the UAE.
You are the master of the decision, and the decision is yours.
You're welcome.
Oh Mashallah, look at him, look at him, the man with the duck legs.
How are you?
Knee knee
The knee is okay, the knee.
We won't be deceived anymore. There's got to be a cruciate ligament or something.
Oh, Abu Nasser.
What is the adductor muscle?
Mqsab, do the same to them, feast, come on, you didn't fall short.
No, honestly, Abu Nasser, you were successful, meaning good players, meaning the Brazilian and the Africans, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you.
I'm saying, the storage room, these boxes, come on, the storage room.
Mashallah, you have a second business.
No no no, just players, just players.
Hollow, they're unloading cardboard boxes.
Bara'em, yes bara'em. I bring them from where? From the jungles of Africa.
Yeah, why not?
Karem is a hero who has one cartoon.
This is a human being like us.
They say a bud, what have you heard?
They tell you these are buds.
Now that we are...
Why don't you give us this... this bud... as a promotion with them?
My father, Abu Nasser, you are now taking care of him, raising him, making him useful to you.
Then he will go to the national team, then Harar, he is in the stadium.
How how how how
Slowly, slowly on him, slowly, slowly on him, you see, this is considered tender, tender.
Put it in the annex, they will take care of it. Goodbye.
Anything you need, all the players are with me.
If the owner of this coach understood.
We are winning two to zero, we are dominating the match.
Dad, this is a coach in Spain.
I don't like it.
The successful coach.
The one who regulates the traffic during the match.
North, for example, this is a line, its opposite is the Al-Wakrah line.
Frankly, this is your coach. We won't let him do as he pleases.
Dad, dad, the coach hasn't been with the team for two months.
We need to find a solution with him.
If he understood football, he would activate the flanks, not just stay attacking from the depth all match long.
Yeah, and he's relying on a offside trap.
Oh my mother, and whoever delivers you, don't hurt my head.
The supposed to be withdrawn Kakuonomalalawi my father.
I will not provide a translation, as the input appears to be nonsensical or generated text, and does not contain any meaningful content to translate.
No no no no no no I don't even want him to play.
This phrase appears to be in
Which line?
Implement the plan.
Wakhal Hoololo
Something that doesn't necessarily have to be, doesn't necessarily have to be between the manager and the team coach.
And the star of today's match, and the star of the team, scores a super hat-trick. Wow, you are amazing, oh Gecolamanando.
How come we don't understand football?
Listen, O Sultan.
Let him go home.
No no, don't deliver it in the bakery's car, let him take a taxi.
That's it, it's none of your business.
Come on, stay on the line with me.
That means it's good that my father did this.
The coach, if he leaves, will make us stay like this.
What is he/she doing next?
The team is being destroyed.
May peace be upon our team.
Oh my mother, oh my mother.
He's not sober, meaning he told you to come, you're divorced, tell the truth, what happened between you?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, "This man does not appeal to me."
I feel that he is not responsible.
Let's forget about the excessive talk and the discussion about the past.
Go to your father-in-law and find out the story. Why did your daughter get divorced?
What can I tell you, brother Rashid?
But what was the reason he divorced her then?
No, no, it's not permissible, oh Abu Abdullah. We must know why the girl got divorced. We have the right to know.
Please, it's none of your business.
How can I not interfere when the man is sitting in the majlis, he came to find out why his daughter got divorced.
A wife who does not appreciate her husband or respect his feelings.
And who is this Barcelona?
You're not to blame, you don't know that "league" is Spanish.
Barcelona, this is not just one.
This is Guardiola's team.
Okay, here's the translation of the text you provided: "So, I go now to the guy who's sitting in the majlis waiting for me."
If you don't go, I'll go. Okay, just stay here. Get out of it, you. What kind of people can't raise their daughters properly?
Get the door, meaning don't just shake your head at me like that.
Oh, is it not enough that she insulted the Barcelona team?
Messi, the magician of football, who never fails to score a hat-trick in every match he plays.
Maradona, who is Maradona, said that Messi will turn out better than him.
Here's the translation: "And your daughter, who has no shame on her face, is insulting me. You see now."
Your daughter is neither a Barcelona fan nor someone who fits in with us.
What do you mean by that?
Listen to me, may God guide you.
So that you can have the intention that my children...
He will go apologize to her and appease her.
You're lying.
And then, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
Why did we lose our money if we are not going to make our son happy with it?
Yeah, but that's it.
The condition is that I propose a girl to you, and she must be a Barcelona fan.
Mother, I am not upset.
Don't you understand, mother? Forget about her, she's gone to hell.
Here comes my son, here comes my dear.
You know, my dear, they are the real losers.
You are a thousand girls, I wish for you.
Here you go, Mom.
You broke my heart, that's a shame.
Poor thing, it's been two days since it was painted.
After a marriage that lasted only one month, poor thing.
What's wrong with you? Do you want to get me in trouble with him?
Mom, I don't want to get into trouble with him.
And who told you this nonsense that doesn't make sense?
Don't mind her.
You don't know whose son this one will be.
What is this?
That's her livelihood.
Are you telling me about the building I really wanted to buy and turn into a hotel with furnished apartments?
What's in Mansoura?
His father's right means that tomorrow, when his son takes our daughter, and I ask him for the apartment building.
And if you can't.
Talk to her brother.
Listen to me carefully.
A rich kid whose father is a millionaire.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire?
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
You know that because of their excessive affluence, they own a palace in Spain just so they can spend their summer vacation there every year.
Okay, well, and this Barcelona story, how does that mean?
It is possible that the girl's family spread this rumor about him to prove that their daughter is innocent.
Even if we assumed that the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and has loyalty to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect this.
And I didn't insult the team.
That's if we assume the story is true.
God bless his father, they call him "Abu Burjein" (father of two towers) because he has two towers on the corniche.
He made them in a strange way like this, like a rope, they are all wrapped around each other.
The people you see from afar, they think they are one tower.
What did you say, good omen, good omen, come?
Ah, may God greet the one who came to us.
God bless you, okay, extend your hand, eat something, God bless you.
Thank you, darling.
Just give me good news, I see with my eyes, Abdullah, my son, is waiting for your reply.
No, Umm Abdullah, don't worry, my dear.
If I were to search the entire Gulf Cooperation Council, I would not find anyone better than you.
Come on, tell them to finally provide us with their estimates for building the building.
I'm done, your honor. Do you need anything else, sir?
They will contact you, the family.
See their wedding requirements, prepare the check, and I will sign it.
In the name of God, what God wills, in the name of God, what God wills. With your permission, sir, sir, with your permission.
Abdullah responded to the divorce.
Congratulations, God willing, the kids, and from them money, God willing.
May God bless you, my aunt.
You wear it for warmth against the cold.
Oh, but I don't know where my mom booked for us.
Mom, I'm telling you, where did you book for us?
Mom says she booked us for Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia, come on.
Goodbye.
What's wrong with you? Someone came from their honeymoon crying.
What's wrong, my dear? Tell me.
Tell me what's happening, my dear son.
She considers herself very much, oh my.
Why is she acting superior?
Let her be arrogant and leave.
Oh mother, it's good that you sent her to her family's house.
You broke my heart.
Hi mom.
Okay, what's wrong with her being like this?
What happened to her?
May God keep you safe. Don't forget to bring us back olive oil from Spain.
What, Spain? Then where are we going?
Okay then.
Mom says she booked us a trip to the Maldives.
Oh, oh, it's okay, my dear mother. After the Maldives, it's beautiful.
And by the way, she will come and entertain you with blessings, God willing, with blessings.
Now, did I say that you are back, happy from the trip?
What's wrong with my liver, Mom? Why is he taking the kids?
Come and take the suitcase.
What's happening between them?
What's wrong with you, my dearest one?
Shut up, you, and whoever is making you well, you're going to teach me about my son's face after...
What's wrong, my dear mother? What's bothering you?
When I see the shells, I get depressed.
May he who upsets you live, my mother.
Let her go, just divorce her, divorce her, don't worry about her, any money, your father, a lot, and the girls, a lot.
Shut up, you, and may God give you health, my son, and I know him well. The slightest thing, oh, and why, then, should he live bothered?
Go, my son, call her and divorce her.
May God bless her.
Say "Woe, woe" three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, I still have two more chances.
Divorced, divorced.
I swear, he's so angry, I swear.
Just go, my son. Go, I sacrifice myself for you. Go and rest, and put the worry out of your mind. The girls are ready to be taken, just like they say. Go, my son.
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
He divorced me, Mom, that's it, he divorced me, he told me you are divorced, divorced.
Why would he divorce you, the shameless one who doesn't respect himself? Truly, he has no manners.
What will happen if a woman goes to a disco alone?
And once when necessary, shake what your mother has, it's nothing.
It's nothing, what does it mean, the world has turned upside down.
Here's the English translation: "I'll show him, if I don't go to his house right now and teach him a lesson, then he won't know who you are, girl."
Oh Abu Abdullah, my daughter is getting divorced.
My daughter is getting divorced.
She thinks she's better than everyone else.
Do you sell and buy them from Toys "R" Us stores?
Just like you burned, your daughter is burning now, and you're angry.
And the most important thing is that they didn't do anything, poor things.
What's wrong with you, your mother brought you an apple, peeled it for you, and you divorced her?
Is it normal for you to shoot them as you please?
And she is under the responsibility of a man.
This is normal for you, so to hell with it, let it go.
Drink from the same cup that you made God's creatures drink from.
And the thing that you don't accept for yourselves.
You do not accept it for people.
Do you know this land of the compound? This was his.
And in a strategic location.
Oh, leave it to God.
Not only that, but at a trivial price as well.
My current is stopped.
I need to get approval from Bu Saqer.
Yes, I went to his office but didn't find him.
And I went to him the week before last, and they told me he was traveling.
I can't understand anything without payment, without tomorrow, my situation is standing still, the problem is that there must be approval from Bu Saqr, it must be
Go to his majlis (gathering place).
No no no no this is official work.
"He sent you, may God keep you safe, to the office, not the house."
This phrase
This is an informal Arabic
Listen, everyone has their own key.
Tell me, oh Abu Fahd.
You don't know him.
How would I know him? I only see him on TV. And you didn't tell me that you were of a similar age to him when you went on the Umrah.
But I mean, we don't have that close of a relationship.
May God cut off your stories.
May God guide you, and you didn't even believe I started the car and came. At least ask why this invitation.
There's still an occasion for this, may God guide you.
The month has thirty days, and he is fifty times better at making dinner.
I suggest, may God grant you a long life, that they put you, they put you in the Guinness Book of Records.
The person in the world who makes the most dinner.
Who is this brother you are with?
Welcome, it's an honored hour, I swear.
We are honored, may you live long.
Hey, Abu Falah!
Are you saying that Bu Saqr has dinner every day?
This is what we see.
Bas, Bu Falah, dinner tonight is a special occasion.
Today, may God keep you safe, your son is a falcon.
Mashallah, he deserves it. May you live long and in blessings.
You're welcome, good man. By the way, you're welcome, father.
Peace be upon you.
What's new?
By the way, tomorrow Saqr, my son, will go to the agency and choose the car he wants.
A year and a half I've been waiting for approval.
My livelihood has stopped.
But the day I reached him...
And Boukhita.
May God guide you, that's all, oh Abu Saad.
This is not how things are done.
I killed him, that's it.
The exhibition visitor walks around and chooses the car that he likes.
We buy him three.
I'll take you to him.
I'm going to him alone.
You didn't tell me that you are of the same age as him, and that you met him last year during the Umrah.
Today, his little falcon was born.
Here's his game in the evenings.
This is your chance.
Go see him and congratulate him.
May you deserve well-being, O long-lived one.
Oh, Shaheen, O Bu Saqr.
May God keep you safe. You are all safe, my friends.
Thank God for the safe return of our son Shaheen, may he live a long life.
May God keep you safe and sound.
No one except the brother.
May God grant you a long life.
You didn't recognize me.
I swear to God, even if it's a lie, I'd give my life for you.
I was with you on the Umrah, long life, last year.
Even remember buying a red prayer beads.
May God keep you safe.
I was at the hospital.
I am visiting one of our children.
And I am honored to meet you.
Here is the English translation: H صقر is still hesitant, should I enter the field of trade or have I decided?
I'm tired of him, brother.
Why, father, Saqr? Trade is good.
You never put your own desk and see.
Abu Saqr.
May you live long. Don't turn me down and say "done."
What's new?
A gift, Saqr, I have.
Full role
And if trade loves you and comes to you, saying to it, "I won't come to you."
Here is the translation of the provided text: Who, like you today, has everything available to them? You are the one who got their license, praise be to God, and the world opened up to you: a free car and the best office on the Corniche.
Yesterday, Bu Abdulaziz told your father that if Saqr wants to get into business, he will take him in as a partner with fifty percent.
Mom, how can I possibly manage to balance both business and university?
Mother, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you, God bless you, agencies, offices, and cars are being thrown at you for free.
Here's a translation of the text: Opportunity, my son, who in this time would start his business without capital.
Your main asset is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, my son, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Rose, come on, prepare lunch quickly.
Masha'Allah, wow wow wow wow wow, it even reached for rent and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, tomorrow I'm afraid he'll take the samosa agency.
The empty one, your son, his appetite opened up for business.
This is what you were begging for. You know what he told me today?
Egoley, my dear, I want to expand even more in my investment.
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And keep it away from the eyes of the envious.
Bo Sultan told me yesterday that your son just entered the business.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and shares in two banks.
Oh, I gave him the elbow, the stiff elbow that no certificate or breeze can turn back.
It appears, God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, that's the one in the northern area from our office. What's wrong with him?
I just really feel like having it.
May God bless you, congratulations, Abbas.
In the name of Allah.
May God bless you.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
What, Dad? What? A whole year of hardship and fatigue to set up the supermarket.
What's the story? It seems like he comes every day to check on things.
He saw Taresh for me, this secretary of his, his name is Samir.
Here's the English translation: "I'm telling you, this is Scqr, son of Bu Scqr. He wants to go into business with you instead of taking the shop from you."
After Eid, how much does your partner have?
There is no power or strength except with Allah.
But then I see you started talking to him, no way.
He asked me who the brother was.
I killed him with my bazbaz.
Why would you tell him you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking next to this shop, wasn't there a small sign that said "what what" - what name was written on it?
It is written: Al Fareej Bakery
No, I want a different name.
And upon you be peace.
How's work going for you?
Good, may you live long, God willing, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will finish the labor housing plan for Future Company.
No, Mr. Sars became Mrs. Elissa. I know you, Mr. Sars, the owner of the company.
Hi, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you are very polite.
Even cooking, this is knowledge and study.
Today, someone will come to you and tell you that they work in the business field. They have some capital and want to invest it.
But this is what we have between us; he has neither knowledge, understanding, nor study of economics, nor even of commerce.
One like this.
You think he will succeed, but I don't think he will waste his time and will lose.
I heard that, Abu Nasser.
I heard those two nightingales talking.
What kind of talk is this?
This is your place, my son Saqr, mashallah.
They saw him, mashallah.
They saw him today.
Long life, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We are talking about Al-Qaeda.
Your son is an eagle, mashallah, and my eye is cool upon him. He is considered an exception.
May he be safe, they tell you to talk about Al-Qaeda.
My son, Saqr, scared us. He built himself up, by himself.
Here's the translation: **"Kahu gave him a car once as a gift."**
He sold it and invested the money, and a piece of advice from him himself.
And mashallah, look at what you've found.
Oh, look, we're talking about ordinary people.
And one of them became like that, and this is exactly what they did with him. Abu Nasser took him and put his hand on the way.
Masha'Allah, Saqr has commercial talents.
And tremendous economic tendencies.
We have to ask who his father is.
I swear to God, I'm really amazed.
Mashallah.
Gulf Funds Magazine in the Economic Poll
Please come in.
And peace be upon you, hello hello Salem.
Hope all is well.
I swear, I don't know what to tell you, Salem.
Yes, tell him.
The story is true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they told him, "It's over."
I couldn't stand the house.
As you can see.
They tell you that as soon as he heard the news
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
And He has, so He remains over it.
Oh, as the saying goes, I taught him archery, and when his arm became strong, he shot me.
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salim.
I'm shocked.
Can you believe there's actually something like this in the world?
A man gives to the poor with his right hand, without his left hand knowing.
This association, of course, is the one whose donations reach all Muslims throughout Asia and Africa.
But I of course want you to also explain to us, O long-lived one, about your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at the Saqr Charitable Society is to achieve solidarity within this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers afflicted by the earthquakes in Pakistan.
This is also, finally, and not least, meaning that we are now appointing seven poor families.
A monthly salary of one hundred and thirty-two riyals only.
No no, we're not late for you.
And right after that, we'll come to you.
My life.
This is Khaled and his wife inviting us tonight at the hotel.
Yes, I swear, anywhere, anywhere, as long as you and I are there, I will be happy there.
My life, may God keep you for me, oh Lord.
My dear, my
This is my livelihood, it's a sin.
This bakery.
And save some money for yourself.
Five riyals of bajla, three riyals of bread, Har.
Two falafel.
Five beans, good beans, good.
Make me six bagels.
Come on, you divers!
The captain arrived and brought breakfast.
He wants men.
Please, your highness/longevity.
What happened?
No no, the request I'm asking you, I have to hear the word "done" from you, I have to hear it ringing in my ears.
Hello Nora.
Al Anoud is upset with you.
Why am I able to make you angry?
Hopefully it will be alright.
Why are you upset?
Noura Amnayeh's dress is simple and elegant.
He came back. Don't say that, Anoud will get upset.
Why are the Lebanese people so sweet-tongued?
You too, don't overdo it and keep taking and giving with him a lot.
Me too, I'm very possessive of her.
And the most beautiful dress for the most beautiful flower.
They are spoiling her, and he even calls her "Nawara" (meaning "flower" or "blossom").
How much is left on it?
My payment is twenty thousand, and my due is twenty thousand riyals.
May you be compensated, congratulations, God willing.
May God be with you.
Hello, may you live long, Um Saleh.
Hey Fadi, it looks like you're busy. I don't want to keep you.
My eyes are present for you.
Hello hello
Did you get the message yesterday?
You arrived, you idiot.
And you liked the joke.
Okay, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them. Show me your designs, and I'll choose from them.
Honestly, your taste is the most beautiful.
They make me work out of envy.
The day I found out that my project was going well and was bringing in good money.
Someone told you that there is a guy doing a project like mine.
Design and Tailoring Shop
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser, who has nothing to do with trade.
Your banks are located
His cousin's circumcised.
These days, it's like that.
Good, good, my cousin.
Do you believe it? I was sleeping, they woke me up and said your cousin wants you.
Hopefully it's good, anything you want.
God willing, it will be alright.
If only.
You don't intend to do any project, for example, I mean, for example.
Just be, oh you want a partner or something?
I heard, I mean, they say, I mean, that you intend. I said, I'll pass by you, maybe.
Welcome and hello.
And if you want more, it's available.
Thank God, work is excellent.
What do I want to do, oh Abu Saleh?
But we're late. They rented it out last week.
Yes, indeed.
Hopefully, it will be alright. God willing. Goodbye.
He remains.
Are you sure?
And with it comes details, and you don't know the biggest calamity.
What else?
He rented a shop next to your shop.
You envious one, you spiteful one.
Before I found out that the market is open to everyone.
I have to meet.
Your heart must be open to your cousin.
I'm not coming. I'm asking you.
You deceive, attract, and laugh at me, and what do you do to me?
I want to do my work quietly.
You are taking the place of an adhesive in my place, it ruined me.
I swear, but they didn't say come here and sit in my mouth next to my wisdom tooth, it drove me crazy.
This is envy, this is malice, I swear to God, I swear, I will hit you, this malice destroyed me because of him.
Oh, you are family, guys.
Don't worry, Mr. Saleh.
Threaten me, I swear I will beat you up, be careful. Oh you with the big chin.
I extend my hand just as you extended your hand to me, and you made me choke, you made my livelihood choke.
Hey guys.
Hey everyone, pray for the Prophet.
I didn't do anything, I swear, I swear.
He advised me to get a designer from the Philippines.
Nobody should deceive you.
Why, I mean, why, what's the meaning, Lebanese, it means.
They chatted with him, joked around, and laughed, taking complete comfort.
I see that Busaleh brought a Lebanese person.
He kept telling me and trying to convince me.
He enchanted me, he enchanted me with his words.
And he convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
And two days later, God is your agent, I'm going to Souq Al-Haraj and I find the cup there, its twin, for 900 riyals.
And he took the money.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
Is it possible to meet the professor? Yesterday you told me it was difficult. Today it's also difficult.
Yes, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed these past couple of days.
What's wrong?
No, I don't know what's wrong with it.
Abu Saleh is very psychologically distressed after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer like him.
From WATA, the past two weeks, the store's sales have been affected.
What is this flaw here in Qatar? No Qatari opens a store unless another Qatari comes and implements the same project and opens the same store next to it. Can I enter it?
No no no, the designer Fadi Hala is with him and they are thinking of a solution.
How is this happening now?
We're sitting here as if we've eaten poison.
If we continue like this, I think we won't even be able to afford the rent of the shop.
A place far from them, meaning...
This means to clear the stage for them.
Okay, thank you, and what is the discount?
What's the big deal? Hopefully, you won't give away a bridal gown with every wedding dress, along with free evening gowns.
What's up, my people?
What's up, what happened? I'm going to the store next to yours today. They just put up an ad with every wedding dress, two free evening dresses. And on top of that, a twenty-five percent discount.
Let's go, let's go.
No, and now wait for you two weeks, they will come down with the same dress, make me one wedding dress and get two dresses for free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I think that too, because tomorrow if we leave them, they will ruin our house for us.
Never mind them.
What else does he have?
This means this is a challenge and I thank him.
It's not a challenge then.
Well done, that's good what you're doing to him, the nasty one. He doesn't want anyone else to make a living.
Oh, come on, I'll tell you in two or three days if I don't close his place down completely.
Well done.
Stay, stay, sugar, sugar. I'm coming, coming to you now, coming. Okay, bye.
What's going on?
Saad says the store is unbearable, you can't sit in it, there's a bad smell. He says he doesn't know where it's coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, no.
Its smell doesn't disappear from the store before at least six days.
One hundred percent.
Yay, at night!
Someone cut the electricity wires to the shop.
This means this is fair.
Now, will you sign a pledge, or shall we file a case and open a file?
What are you going to do to him?
By erasing it from existence.
Uncle Bonasser, something strange is happening. No one is entering the store.
Uncle Abu Nasser, sugar, sugar, there's a customer coming to me, I'll call you back, it's strange.
Here, he is on his bed, fallen, yes.
I'm saying it's a mental state. I, my brother, was afraid to tell him. The bank called and wants the installments.
His debts piled up because of his cousin, this miserable one.
Zain, what happened this time?
And if they accidentally enter the store and see the designer Saad, scream in his face and run away from him.
Here's the translation: Oh, I'm sleepy. And it's upon me. What can I do? Sleep is taking over. My eyes are getting heavy. And I'm staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saad is at the store.
I bewitched him, I don't know what I did to him.
When the women see him, they get startled and become afraid.
I don't know what to do about it.
He lost me, he lost me.
Give me a lot, man.
I'm afraid they will imprison me.
And I don't have any proof against him to go and complain about him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Let him deserve it.
Please tell me what kind of magic you did for him. You made the designer turn into a monster, and women are scared when they see him.
A rumor was spread about him.
Okay, here's the translation of the text you provided: "Guys, it's not going to happen. You guys, tell him the photography group needs him urgently."
Hey everyone, please I'm begging you, for God's sake, please tell him they need him, urgently, extremely urgently.
By God, they will raise my blood pressure, they will slaughter, paralyze me, it should not happen like this, oh Professor Abdullah.
Maali Ahmed, my love, you are back. Don't make me get angry like this. You have a kind heart, it's not good for you like this, my dear.
I swear I called him so many times, they hurt me, it ached, but it was no use. This extra actor is driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You're not doing anything, everything is on my head.
Goof, he returned, Baba, I will put the free in you.
His beauty, twenty-five scenes, sixteen, come on Hamad, we want to finish.
And then, what, I stop filming because the extras aren't ready?
What is this production?
Well, what do I care, Mr. Abdullah? Why is he yelling at me like this?
My love, do you want no one to bother you?
What's happening, Abdullah?
Extra, late, and in trouble.
Oh Ahmed, I don't want anyone to be my love.
Give me someone with prestige, prestige that convinces people that he can actually be a millionaire, a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please come in, take pictures, and your request will be ready within half an hour.
Not just anyone, Olaa, not just anyone. I'm still, uh, clarifying for him, telling him.
That's it, I'll manage on my own, with two scenes instead of one.
Fantoa, you bear the responsibility, and you, the production manager, bear the responsibility.
And when what will they do?
They will do everything inside. The director is irritated and the situation is to God, but they will act.
This one wants someone with special specifications to secure this.
Are you serious?
I didn't hear what the director said.
I have one, may God help you with him, God willing he will be useful.
SS Saud Agcnar
Saud is a can, I'm the one who tells him, Saoud is a fire.
Yes, this is the day when he was young, they used to call him "Aswad Kanar". And when he grew up, they called him "Gawati".
Why cans?
Here's the English translation: I'll tell you why he's poor. He's been wandering the streets, collecting and selling discarded cans by the kilo.
My brother, sing and be proud, not disappointed.
It seems that he must fit in here. Look, the one I told you about, Mamdouh, is like this, and also short. He doesn't have any height or width.
It definitely works, of course.
Okay, I'll tell you, they fixed the makeup a hundred percent, it works, he's light-hearted, he is.
Okay, what are you waiting for? Just call him.
I don't have the number.
But I will take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's house?
What is he saying?
Shut up, shut up, you!
Saud Qawati
We don't have someone in our neighborhood named Saud Qawati.
Yes, I'm sure he's in the neighborhood, but I don't remember which house.
This is the house of a man named Saud. He lives there with his mother.
Yeah, right.
But this is not Saud, the can.
This is Suud's laptop.
Sure, it's just evolved with time. The laptop is like a can.
He is tall, sturdy, and somewhat wheat-colored.
You'll find him canceling the lowly ones and starting to suppress old laptops, oh my, oh my, oh my, uncle.
Going to the vegetable market to buy it for me, and where is the second one?
I swear, Dad, I don't know.
This is what she always wears.
I have another one, mom. Where is the second ghutra?
Right of Return
This is what I'm looking for, where is it?
FXX and BOVES
Dad, iron it a little before mom sees it all broken.
But these two days it's been more intense for me.
Mom, may God guide you. Since yesterday, I've been insisting on taking you to the emergency room. I keep telling you to let me take you.
Oh Mom, they told me they will give me.
Thank God, here he is, father. You came to work instead of your idle sitting.
Okay, Mom, goodbye then.
She went to argue with him, getting worked up, acting foolishly, going upstairs.
You sit down a little, move slowly, and you have the camera move next to you.
Yes, Jaafar, yes.
Whose laptop is this?
Oh Aboud, the Riyal is a big actor, Abdullah the shiny one.
This is what you have. I, on the other hand, am the son of Fat. عبود, how are you?
How are you, slave?
Just calm down, man. Respect yourself a little in front of people here.
Any boy from our neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, settle down.
I love to act, God willing they will give me a role, I will impress you.
I swear, my brother, it's not like you.
I'm really tired, I swear to God. I even believe that yesterday I couldn't sleep, man.
Asthma, may God heal.
May God heal her.
Falling in spring.
Hey professor, hey professor!
He has asthma medication, I think it's for his mother.
A director, not a doctor.
You're leaning on me. Listen to what he's saying. By God, you don't have a clue.
What's his mother's name?
Spit on you, what do you think?
I heard what she's saying about you.
It's telling you it's light, let it be a bit heavier, heavier.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to repair my car's tire.
And give him three million to bring me dinner.
Tony, I have a question. Why do I speak like this?
Because I am heavy, according to some people's requests.
Guff, Mr. Ghafel, Feryajna Production, actors at the highest level.
Currently, he's excellent, meaning he's brought to us, suitable for the role.
sweet and i will help you too, i am a viewer, i do not have, i do not have, right?
Hi, are you buying your house?
I swear, he's fallen into spring.
Here's the translation: "Take the gentleman and bring him to the makeup room. Do his makeup. As for Salman, God willing, I will make him bring you the clothes and bring them to you."
Walk, walk, walk, it's very nice.
Yes, yes.
Listen brother, keep the car with us until we finish filming. I will call you to come and take it.
Don't worry, but is there anyone who can give me a ride?
Here are a few possible translations, depending on the intended nuance:
Come on, then, call your friend, this extra actor, call him, come on.
Hey guys, call Saud. The laptop is in the makeup room.
Let him go, man, he's going to clean my teeth.
It was written in front of me.
Let's say.
I'm done, actually.
I didn't expect that from you.
What are we silent about?
We are silent about our rights.
Yeah, wait.
And I know who I'm arguing with, Bu Abdulaziz.
Brother, why did he divorce her, brother?
Just divorce her, that's it.
And we don't take a thief's daughter.
No, it's not needed. What do you think?
He will clean up later, but the important thing is that you just prepare yourself because you will enter the dressing room to change your clothes, and we are ready for the shoot.
My fillings are expensive, the dentist's.
Hey guys, this scene was very difficult to shoot.
Why though?
I don't want tea, man. I'm bored. My stomach is bloated. What is this tea that we've been waiting for for an hour? Until when will we wait? Oh.
Dad, after you, I didn't see anything. This is normal.
May God give you health/strength.
Quick, mashallah.
May God keep you safe, long life to you, in God's safety.
Say hello to the group for me.
Their saying, "Abo Abdul Aziz says hello to you."
God willing, may you live a long life, God willing.
Sweet, huh.
Ashurak, they are greeting you, they love your nose, after.
This is the first time someone has loved me for my nose.
How do they love them, kissing their noses?
Problems
His nose got hit like an ice cream stick. Your lips cracked, they're beautiful, beautiful.
I swear, you didn't make me laugh either.
No problem at all.
It means the best actor.
Hope everything is alright, what's wrong with your voice?
Dad, dad, I'm tired, waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Oh, welcome to the sheikh, oh, welcome.
Hey man, look around here or there, look for yourself.
Listen to me, O...
Yes, come on.
Hollow, excessive courtesies.
What's happening, father?
And upon you be peace, what's wrong, may you live long.
Let go, let go, let go.
And don't worry, God willing, it will be fine, Dr. Hassan, come, come.
Hey Dr. Hany, what's going on?
May God give you a long life, let him rest in the office.
Don't worry about it.
Everyone, God willing, will recover safely.
Please come in, please come in, Your Highness, please come in.
Shut up or I'll give you a punch in the face.
Here is my name, Bouabdellaziz.
Call me, say "Uncle."
How are you, uncle?
By God, look at this face.
Yes, may God prolong your life.
Please come in, sir. Have a seat.
May God bless you.
With this face.
Go with him, Mr. Rashoud.
I swear, if he doesn't do anything for you, let me know and I'll deal with him.
Hey man, can I get a doctor quickly?
My mother is sick, doctor, and
Wait for your turn, your turn.
Listen to me, O...
Possible friend.
Oh Dad, quickly, I'm tired.
Oh, despite all your hospital visits, you take your mother every week? I haven't seen any of them. And by the way, they are good-natured and easily pleased with the least thing.
Not like the local girls.
No, leave the local girls alone.
Okay then, find yourself someone from the hospital.
It's on my mind.
But dude, you're not giving me any attention.
Okay, here's the translation of the text into English: "Alright, if you approach her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intention is good."
There is nothing, there is nothing.
Respect yourself.
Here is the translation of the input text into English: "And if not, go, go, and if not, go, go, speak, call security because I want to speak, what."
No no, I don't want anything.
The necessary liquid needs to leak.
I am Asan Khatri.
No, no, thank you.
You can take it and go.
The one who talks to you, Fal Al-Marzooz.
Would you marry him? I mean, would you marry him?
No no, let me, I want the bisht, and I want the clothes, and I want the car too, I'll rent it from you.
Because I, uh, uh, to give you your wage.
La La
Come on.
What is this, a lizard basking on the asphalt?
Oh welcome, oh greetings, may God welcome those who came to us, oh welcome.
The translation of the input text is: **Which refuge, yesterday, met my eye?**
I wish you had come.
I tell you, they were impressed with what I did for them. It was a very classy and distinctive party.
One regular and the other diet.
You don't have an excuse now.
What is this?
Mom, I promised the guys I'd be at work tomorrow.
God willing, you will take this to them.
What's wrong?
Noura, come here.
What is this?
This will lead to his friends, to the scandals.
You carry it away, you make all the people talk about us.
Give me the money, and tomorrow I will go and buy you something classy.
Yeah, but I'm not dating them now.
And I have to take him tomorrow.
Okay, now they're open, get up and change so we can go and get ourselves something white for our faces in front of the people.
What's wrong with you, come on.
Its price is suitable and its quality is very good.
Above average means not the highest quality.
Even if there is chocolate for the discerning eye, but sorry, I thought maybe you wanted the right price.
After this, he is already expensive, why do you still take us to the most expensive one?
It's impossible for Chicky to add this artistic touch.
Heidi is the name of the Royal Chocolate.
The same chocolate that the Spanish Royal Court always orders.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty certificate as well.
Please, please, be happy.
Come on, brother, give us some of that chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion, my clever friend?
Not Saleh Abdel Qader, the one in accounts.
Congratulations, he deserves it. Come on, give me one too. Come on.
And get us some coffee quickly!
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, my dear, I went to their wedding. It was a failure, it made me sick. You won't believe what my sister...
I heard what your aunt said.
That's why I want to throw you a wedding like no other.
You haven't got much time left, only a month and a half.
I am arranging everything.
But that's it, he's leaving me.
You're not living in society. Don't you see the people who are getting married, putting their wealth and their possessions?
You saw for yourself.
When I bought you something decent, see how they praised you and praised your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's wonderful and beautiful?
True, but then how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the coffee would bring four sheep for the wedding.
Here's the English translation: "And whoever is keeping you safe, you don't need to involve your mother, she knows how to do everything. All you have to do is give her the money, that's it."
It means that they agree to anything we choose.
And seriously, you have no taste.
What do you think about that idiot?
But discrimination costs more money.
Zain, why, why, the one who left was beautiful.
What do you think about this one?
For the first time in the history of Qatar, someone is thinking of making a wedding stage decorated in the shape of a computer mouse.
Excuse me for a bit.
Look, you can talk about anything, but not about the wedding dress and preparations. This is the place where the women will sit who have nothing but talk. Just be quiet.
The riyal is waiting for us.
We want this to be the mouse's wedding canopy.
Corner of the Strange
The latest model in two thousand and eleven.
We already got the mouse.
Spare yourself, all of this is for your own good.
The important thing is, choose whether it's Noah's Ark. If you increase it by twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Let's go and we are ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think of yourself marrying in the Comoros Islands? This is the country's wire.
And we're just starting.
If you don't want a wedding stage, then where will the bride sit, in a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and deceive us. These people are con artists, after all.
And what are you now, exactly?
Upset and angry.
You don't want me to get married, that's it.
I'm talking to the bride's mother and telling her that Saleh has difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married, he can't afford the wedding expenses. It's normal, do you want me to talk to her? I'm serious, I will talk to her.
We received a flower arrangement from Holland today.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding
Surely for the first time in Doha.
And the Middle East after.
Put it on the bill.
How much more will it increase?
Umayah seventy-two, yes, that's it.
But Samir, I don't want to see this formation at any wedding.
You know, after my experience with people...
Okay, consider them reserved.
You know, your salary is higher than mine.
A door opens for you that I don't know how to close.
May God help you, Saleh.
But come on, you, may God guide you, if you tried to gather things up a little.
As for me, thank God, I have decided to go and find a wife from any Arab country.
They're telling you there's a wedding party that won't cost you more than a thousand or two thousand dollars, and that's it.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You just decide how many cards and tell me.
Since the cards serve the purpose, that's it. The important thing is that people know they are invited, where, and at what time, and that's it.
That's all that matters to you, not what people will say.
People know the level of the wedding from the cards.
Yeah, tomorrow when they see these cards, I know what people will say.
They leaned over their wedding, since these are their cards. They haven't seen the cards of So-and-so and So-and-so.
We didn't say that. We're going to order it from the internet.
Its cover is made of panda bear plush fabric, and it has two zippers made of silvery metal.
You're not wrong, but I don't care about you.
I will not become gum in the mouths of women. The cards, we order them, meaning we order them.
I swear, my heart breaks for you, my brother.
Poor guy, his family must be putting pressure on him.
Oh man, he didn't leave anyone he didn't borrow from.
What are you saying? He even sold his car.
He aged twenty years overnight. In the morning, I saw him walking and talking to himself.
I don't blame him, my brother. He's poor, I swear. I don't know when we will develop.
Close the door, please.
Forgiveness, my brother.
So you didn't try to convince them that you're having a small wedding?
What I mean is, it's just my level.
Why am I living alone?
The problem is that our society is sick with appearances, boasting, and arrogance.
You are forced to be a patient with the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Once I caught a glimpse of the mother of the bride's right.
I only wanted my clothes.
Leave it to God.
Tell me.
How did you get married?
And I don't want to marry a crazy person, that's me.
And then, my brother, even if I decided to get married...
I'm thinking of taking a foreigner or even an Arab.
Yes, I swear, your country tells me.
We had already decided to get a DJ for the music.
But Madam Umm Nasser, she got a lot for her son's wedding, that singer.
This singer is famous, but I can't remember his name.
What's wrong, why are you frowning?
Jannah, you don't like what I'm doing?
Enough, he sold his car and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
I just went in to see him in the room and I found him talking to himself.
I see your words have changed now.
Because my brother Saleh is very tired, that's it.
I'm not responsible for you or him.
I am no less than people.
Don't make us a laughing stock.
Please, mother, just let my brother spend all he has, and he hasn't left anyone he hasn't borrowed from.
Please be quiet, you.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother told her, "I'll cancel the wedding. I don't want to get married anymore."
Now where is she?
Inside, they are providing first aid to her.
They say now it's better, but they will arrange a room for her in the hospital.
Did you see the scandal?
You relax your soul, my sister.
Dr. Qalaj said don't talk and gave you an injection so you don't get sick.
Where can I rest when he's making us a laughingstock for everyone, good or bad?
Here's the translation: Bro, I tell him to bring us Abdullah Arwishid, he says he doesn't have any money.
This phrase is
He was afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her, and kiss her on her head.
And tell her I will do what you want.
Beep for Abdullah Awad Al-Ruwaished.
bouyoussef is good, i don't think he will hold back with me.
Shame on you, you couldn't find anyone other than Bu Yousef?
What's wrong with her, okay?
You really screwed up, Saleh.
But the minister left him because he is an old man, and on top of all that, he is disciplined and honest.
Here's my opinion, Dad: If you go and tell him what you told me, there's a high probability his heart will stop.
I got it.
Because of the shitty crisis that you are going through, you want to ask BuYusuf for money, of course, from the ministry's money.
And God knows when you will return them to him.
Hey, if they don't come to him, the auditing group, and ask him about the money.
He can go to hell, of course.
No one knows, then he knows how to handle it.
I swear, how are you? The man is in his office, and you are carrying the responsibility if something happens to him.
Late in my life, I am embezzling.
My uncle, isn't this what they call embezzlement?
In the first drawer.
I'm sorry, I cannot provide a translation for this input. The input appears to be a recording or transcription of speech, possibly in a dialect or language that is not widely represented in translation resources. The quality of the input is also poor, with frequent interruptions, background noise, and mumbling, which further complicates the task of accurately transcribing and translating the speech.
God willing, my uncle, my uncle Bu Yousef, I, I, if it weren't for my difficult circumstances.
I'll return it all.
Call me BuYusuf.
You are the last of my life.
You ruined me, Khamis!
Saleh Saleh
Listen, Hassan, I swear, if it was anyone else, they would have been beaten up or something would have happened to them. Oh, oh, oh, Khaled.
Saleh Saleh
All the ways I've tried have been useless, Uncle Bu Yousef, I'm drowning, that's it.
I can't back out now, it's the wedding.
And these, you know all of them are bald.
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
No no, the spirit is gone, the spirit is gone, the second time.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
My uncle BuYusef, the drawer is full of pills, which one of them?
The Goth guy with the picture of a scaredy cat.
We booked two rooms for ourselves, one for makeup and hair.
And from tomorrow morning we will be there.
Yabna Abdullah Arwaished and his band.
You will see, my love.
No, I'm not going to tell you.
Bomb of the season.
We are the first people to use it in the world.
Oh my mother, oh my mother.
Okay, goodbye.
There is no god but Allah.
Mom, don't forget tomorrow if you enter the hall, read the Mu'awwidhatain (Surah Al-Falaq and Surah An-Nas).
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you that it's wonderful.
The best groom, God bless you, my eye is cool on you.
Oh no, oh no, the police are knocking on the door.
I'm wrong for listening to you, oh God.
It's a shame, today is my wedding.
Ah, the hassle of proofreading, yow!
Come on, hurry up, I'm going to prison.
BoYusef BoYusef BoYusef
It's early yet. / It's still early.
But it's a shame, man, if that happens.
The company submitted a contract for three million, two million of which is just the value of the materials.
He wrote a memo to the minister.
We said there is corruption, but it doesn't reach the levels of corruption to this degree.
You're as if you're not living in this world.
What did the minister say to Othman?
And our manager, why didn't he protest? They say he had...
I don't know, I swear I don't know.
Where is the ethics?
Right became wrong and wrong became right.
Oh Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? What's happening in the world, guys?
He just fired him.
What else?
The wife of the minister's brother.
And this girl is having an affair with the minister.
Oh, my God! (or Oh, my days!)
What's wrong with you, you didn't recognize her from
This is the new employee that the minister appointed in place of poor Othman.
Walk, walk, walk.
What did you want me to do, Saleh? Oppose the minister?
Are you crazy?
Listen to me, Dad.
We have children, we want to live.
I want to live.
What happened?
There's a poor soul standing by the elevator.
The last thing is sincerity and honesty, my brother Saleh.
I wish we could do something for you, my brother.
Thank God, thank God in all circumstances.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
From these strange things that we see in this world, we have come before.
I see things that the mind cannot believe.
My command.
I want you to go to the supermarket and get us the stuff for the salad, and while you're leaving work.
I'm trying, God willing, goodbye.
Who dropped my sister off at home?
And I was sitting in front too, laughing and chatting, who is this?
This is my colleague who is with me at the university. What's wrong if he gives me a ride? It's normal.
Wow wow wow, I can't believe it. What's wrong with you? You're like someone from the past.
What are you saying?
What are you listening to us say?
Your thinking is outdated.
Right and wrong, there is still something new and something old.
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved. We are living in the age of technology.
The era of global changes that engulf the world, and no one can keep up with them.
True, we lived and saw.
Don't blame me, O Amneera. It's against one's will when someone gets annoyed and angry.
What is it that he sees in his daily life?
Tell her I'm sorry.
The world is no longer working correctly.
Zain, don't bother yourself and come have lunch.
Let me go to sleep and rest.
Dad, don't be upset with you.
Dad, there is no problem.
No, don't be upset. Get up, wash your face, and eat lunch.
Come on, my love.
Of course, I am very keen to meet you on my first day of work.
We are honored, may you live long.
Sure, sure.
Of course I know that you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of work.
But at the same time, it's very important.
We are regaining together the values and principles that were poured
For the public good.
The translation depends
We all must.
Looting is a must, may you live long.
Will you be thieves?
Thank you, thank you to all of you.
And what I wanted to say after that.
And I warn you from the first day of my work.
There is only one employee among you.
Trustworthy, loyal, dedicated, and all those other useless qualities.
Just a suspicion.
There is a trustworthy employee.
In order for us to take the necessary legal measures in our ministry.
I don't have good news, may you live long.
Thank God we are all thieves.
Glad to hear that, sir. My colleagues are working on it from all angles. I'm saying...
Where is Khaled?
Yes, may God prolong your life.
Khaled, they praised you to me a lot, a lot, mashallah on you.
God willing, may you live a long life.
I swear, you chose well, your highness.
May God guide you.
Why do you let the devil cut you off?
Say thank God it came to safety.
Mother, why is my father in prison?
Be quiet, my dear.
No no, repentance.
Mother, why is my father in prison?
You've given us a headache.
It means he became a trustee.
It's a shame you say your father is a secretary.
This is clothes.
All your body is covered.
Shijufu the world.
And God willing, you will look for a job for me. Who will hire you like this?
A respectable woman covers her body and its charms.
And pull it down to the chest, all the way down here, I'm wearing it, suffocating herself.
I'm tired of her, near you.
Not only that, but Dad also bought her a bodycon dress and pants that reveal half of her stomach above the navel.
But there's no use. Don't listen to the talk. You don't want to walk the right path.
Here I am telling you.
You only blame yourself.
We are asking for your daughter Sarah's hand in marriage for our son Rashid.
A man these days, what can he do for his daughter except be a righteous man?
And Rashid, my son, I have good news for you.
That's a good guy.
The hero descended from his hall.
Twenty-four hours a day, drunk.
Drunk, tired, and all day I'm not smelling.
And the rowdiness, don't even ask about it.
And what good upbringing, Abu Rashid.
And I'll give you more good news, you're a hypocrite.
And the horn, how is it?
You're good, my son, but how about the drugs?
Here's the translation of the provided text: "Minimally, I'll give you five riyals if you find a black spot in his eye. So, a competition on him."
Oh Abu Sarah, we didn't come here to propose to her.
You know, mischief and trivialities.
A woman of noble descent.
Congratulations my son, congratulations. This is the way of life, congratulations.
I am drunk.
And I can't walk.
Come on, let's go, Dad.
Yalla bye bye.
Come on, hurry up and call your father so he can come and take you.
Call him, why?
Yeah, so he can come and take you.
Where is he?
Is there a hollow where the one sitting is making a loud wailing sound with a traditional headscarf, and with him is a beautiful blonde girl?
Oh, believe your father is going straight to give it to her.
Hello my daughter my beloved Mona.
Majed was not named Abdulaziz.
What justice.
My daughter, you've driven me crazy.
And you know that since the establishment of the state of Palestine, with its capital Jenin, in the year two thousand and ninety, after signing a comprehensive peace agreement with the state of Israel.
And Israel is still practicing terrorism, pressure, and blockade against it.
The latest is what the Israelis and their Arab friends are raising in claims against the Palestinians.
About them sneaking plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second clause, paragraph A, which stipulates that the Palestinian people must trim their nails every day.
We now take you to the fateful meeting.
My dear cheap sir.
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state.
Hey man, what are you saying? You're a man, man! You're ruining our reputation. Stop it, you two!
Please.
Excuse me, Mr. Tiger, excuse me, Mr. President.
Allow me to speak.
I fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this Israeli representative saying?
We don't have anything solid, stone or plastic, as a commitment from us.
Even our homes, man.
What do you Gulf people call it?
In all of Palestine, it is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood, man.
We don't want speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President
This point is important. Please vote on this matter because growing nails is a violation of the agreement.
Those in agreement, raise your hands.
But I had a strange dream.
In order to control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school that I will be attending tomorrow.
Because I imposed my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are chasing him, tearing his clothes, and he is silent.
How many times has he come to me without a ghutra?
Their manager told me.
Rashid is good, we don't want to fire him.
They draw it, the kids, with chalk.
He removed his ghutra during the Eid al-Fitr prayer in front of the entire world.
And they said this is a teacher with a shaky personality who will ruin it for all of us.
I tell them the story of the ketchup.
Maryam Aad
And what else is the story with this ketchup? This is new, no one told me.
He threw a bottle at him, and it shattered completely on the chair.
He got up and sat down.
And he didn't know about the story/situation.
Except for a dry day, the kids laugh at him in the schoolyard.
Stop it already.
Your manager, who I'm going to work for tomorrow, called me.
But it's okay, we'll still give him a chance.
Because I waited, I wanted to tell you.
The time of kindness and weakness is over.
Oh Abdullah, your cousin is your cousin.
You will see a different Rashid.
And I don't need to remind you of the important educational saying.
You are a graduate of education, and I am a graduate of education.
And we all know the saying.
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
And I will make a mistake.
Woe to him!
The first thing you said when you spoke was "shut up". What are you going to say to him?
I'm sorry,
Which one of you is the one who mocked and said "Be quiet"? It's good that...
You're the one who told me to shut up, well done.
Not me.
The guy next to you.
Go, the truth is with the manager.
And he said, "Mr. Rashid expelled me."
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me?
What do you think about my being annoyed?
The first day should be like this all year long.
Woe to him!
He who hears his voice.
And I explain or talk?
Do you know what that means?
I'm nervous, do you know what nervous is?
It means nervous.
Did you hear me? What did I say, or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
The spirit of the Director's right.
Come on, take your things and get out.
Take your things.
Okay, good.
Surely, by now, they are searching for him.
No, professor, we didn't see him.
True, ice cream with milk, if there's strawberry inside, and it's very sweet, true.
My dear Abdulrahman.
Here is the translation of the given text: "Every human is prone to making mistakes, and humans..."
It's just a joke, dad.
It means, but the most important thing is the subject, meaning it should not reach my father.
I don't want my dad to have the cocoa that's in my bag.
Present, ugly, your jump is ugly, your landing, where is your bag?
In the classroom.
From my eyes.
You're saying that he's happy with you.
You don't know the difference between a person of noble birth and an ordinary one.
How does a tick look? Green red
Come, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
And you're still in the bathroom.
Go to his door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, hurry up quickly.
I'm before all of them, one juice and one chips.
I took their pills, all of them, I annoyed them, my friend Abdulrahman, this is really good for health.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation Plus tape from him.
So what do we learn from this story?
Indeed, man.
He must possess noble character traits.
This is the money for the PlayStation, and he told me he will return the whole PlayStation to me at once.
God willing, Tamer, is there anything else my friend Abdelrahman my friend
Now no.
We learn from the story.
Of course, you know that I am taking this week off because I received approval for higher studies.
So I said I must submit the party file before I travel.
How do I take you in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me he doesn't know where he wants to go, but he didn't specify the time.
Madam, his father returned from a trip and didn't tell him anything. Thank God, I was worried, but I'm relieved.
Fardan, I didn't take him today in the afternoon, and he got upset and didn't tell his father. No, no, no, no, no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman.
May God help you.
What should we do, Samer?
That's sweet, that's sweet like that.
Today, boys, we will take a new lesson in science.
And upon you be peace.
Thank you, thank you.
My water.
I didn't ask for it from my eyes.
Sir, sir, how can you ask the sir for a hundred?
There is a teacher who walks to get water for a student. You are his janitor. No no, this matter will not pass well. I will write it in the report.
Are you mocking me too? Are you making fun of me?
Don't raise your voice and don't yell at me, understand?
How much is this? How much does it cost?
How many cars are there?
Four cars, five.
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What do I do with this?
As you can see, they are building a parking lot in front of our houses and at our expense.
Don't tell me about the days of Bonaaser.
Bonaser, that's it.
He studies abroad.
Zain broke the table.
About being angry, man.
What's the meaning of "ishmana ya'ni"?
Do you have a feather on your head?
Change your attitude towards me.
Me or you.
We didn't say anything, Dad.
What is this?
Listen, let things go smoothly, it's much better for you.
We won't back down, Dad.
What, no need, and I want to make it easier for you.
What are you saying?
Instead of, you know, the thing.
Looks like you want the.
You want this, it's up to you, that's it.
Hurry, hurry!
Ha ha, that's good.
It's not up to him, it shouldn't happen.
His grandfather's neighborhood.
We came to Uncle Bu Naeif's place to have a heartfelt discussion, not to shout at each other.
Who is this Rashid, acting in the neighborhood as he pleases?
You made me speak.
Alright everyone, be quiet and listen to Uncle Bonaif to hear what he says.
Now, this good-for-nothing who isn't worth a penny is playing with your emotions.
Let me handle it.
If I hadn't given him a slap, he would have gotten stuck to the umbrella that he had made.
The game plays with its people.
This is good.
Goodbye.
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store, right?
She's hollow, wearing those rings and chains.
May God give us more.
But just walk, you'll still be worth two in the heat.
Rashid, the naive one who had nothing, became like this.
They appointed him as the Deputy General Director of the World Educational Center.
Here's the English translation: "He tells you, he teaches you. You're a teacher and he's a teacher. But look where he's become and where you've become."
No problem at all.
Don't worry about it, Abdullah.
I'll teach you what the secret is.
The teacher has arrived. The teacher has arrived.
Professor, I didn't do anything.
Teacher, you don't know who this boy is?
Yeah, my love, I know this is the son of...
I'm telling you, we don't get a good opportunity like this often, you know?
I'm looking for a job. You made me laugh, I swear you made me laugh.
Don't worry, the job is in the bag.
Thank you, you didn't fall short, may you be safe, may you be safe, yes.
Say hello to him for me.
I'm sending you greetings from your mother, after God. May He keep you safe and deliver, God willing. Greetings to you.
Oh God, goodbye my love, in God's safety.
After my brother gets involved and becomes a minister, just believe me, father.
Okay, Mom, we will work, we will work hard.
But my father, if your work is not good, they won't say anything.
That's it, he gave it to you.
It's just something normal, nothing special.
It's normal, automatic, this doesn't need explanation.
My dear boy, please, fulfill my dream for me.
Before your dream, my dream.
Arrange for me a tower among the towers of the Corniche.
What are you waiting for?
Thank you thank you thank you
You got this, Abu Saleh.
I say your friend looks annoyed.
I swear, it doesn't seem like it, man.
You're capable and then some, Abu Saleh.
Can you believe Fez took the mobile and gave it to Bu Salih?
Look, these are antics, and surely Abu Sultan is a million percent holding a grudge against him.
Originally, his relationship was not good with Abu Saleh.
No, not to Sultan. He wouldn't do that unless he's up to something.
Is it really to that extent?
He returned to lock the car door for him.
His last job will be to install or uninstall the car doors of the minister.
Oh father, don't hurt my heart, don't hurt my heart.
For your information, the talk we hear in the cafes is happening in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing.
My heart is stopped, my heart is stopped.
I'm afraid the story, Mom, will fall into the mouths of women, and then Latof, the one with the dishes, Mom, she's embarrassing me in front of the women.
Say something, Busalman, speak, I'm shocked, I'm going to collapse.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
Nobody's business.
Namera, I am working on it slowly and steadily.
Since I opened the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plan.
Let them take it away.
Which plan?
But he needs to trust me in the beginning.
They told me his eyes are a minister because he was appointed two months before you.
Because I am certain of carrying it and its weight.
Magic can be undone.
What is this?
What is this one after?
And every activity that photographers prohibit, take photos until his image burns in the newspaper.
And it smells until it floats on the surface.
Of course, he's back.
You be patient, let me work on it and I will show it to you.
On the contrary, long life.
Of course, Your Excellency the Minister.
Then come and tell me.
I thanked him for the lamb, by the way, it's good meat.
The riyal is at the door, get up for it.
Don't be a fool, people want to praise you, but you want to belittle yourself.
Minister, please, go ahead, go ahead.
La La La I cannot imagine me no the minister's happiness just a picture a picture the minister's happiness
Give him a second, hit him.
I swear to God, my brother, I really liked your plan.
Your father, do you want to take him?
image image image
Which minister must...
Okay, I'll tell you, wait a moment.
Go to the second to last page.
Jufi, his picture is so big next to the groom.
Say, "There is no deity except Allah."
Yes, every day has its picture or two.
According to what you said, he is a social media activist. Come on, come on, goodbye.
They all love you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
There's a spoon in every pot.
These people are spiteful and envious of you. Don't throw stones, for only the fruitful tree is stoned.
Take me to the market.
What equipment haven't you prepared yet?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very well known.
Shh, Sisma, Abdul Hadees, Abdullah, shh.
This is my husband.
I don't understand this sentence.
350
This is a difficult
Until today, I'm at home. I hope nothing bad has happened.
I swear, let me be today. I have a headache, my head is throbbing, my body is broken, and my colon is acting up.
I'm tired, I swear I'm tired. It's been a month and now I'm looking.
Let me rest today.
Hello, is this Um Sultan?
Yeah, I say.
Oh, come on, just let me know when it arrives.
I see you've sweetened it.
You saw what fame did to Ibn Banafsaj.
I know, thank God you're convinced.
The truth is revealed.
Your minister is apparently a procrastinator; it seems the matter pleased him.
I'll send it to my brother, Saad.
No, I swear, I didn't follow any activity today and I didn't read the newspapers, I don't know.
Be optimistic, come on, goodbye.
God is the one who wants the removal of the ant, so He gave it wings.
Peace be upon you, my brother. Don't you have anything tonight at the hotel for a conference?
Wedding
Oh, so everything means there's no activity, like a party, birthday, or wedding.
I don't know, but maybe you can check out the hotel behind us.
Oh, there's a hotel behind you, huh?
Is it okay if I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go, take your comfort, go ask yourself, go.
May God grant success to everyone, God willing.
This minister allows us to sleep and rest.
He means he couldn't find a party or wedding or any occasion for him to attend.
Fifteen thousand hotels and he didn't find anything. His luck is as rotten as his face.
You be quiet, just him.
I didn't find him a birthday
The right, it can be caught in the second half.
Every number has a hundred forms.
He doesn't sleep, he doesn't sleep, my brother.
Oh man, he's full of it, saying this is the first thing he's proud of, his picture, and after that he'll make the bread.
Are you saying your kids had a competition about a picture of the Minister of your leg?
One person asks another, saying to him: "How many pictures did they put for the minister in the newspaper today?"
And whoever wins, they give him a prize.
Here's the English translation: "That's not how it is. You come to the cafe and hear the comments every day about the picture in the newspaper. They tell you he's an old man who never stops."
God's demise is near.
That's it, as they say, the butterfly until God wills its disappearance. It approached the light.
People are giving you gifts and greeting him.
He has become one of the most famous celebrities in the country.
Oh really? And who is this?
You ruined my prestige.
May God keep you safe and keep her safe.
Are you saying that all of us got married except Amal, poor thing, she's the only one among us who didn't get married.
This fate.
It is not written for me to get married.
And I've already forgotten the issue of marriage.
May God be sufficient against those who were the cause.
Here are those soft guys sitting over there.
What's wrong with them?
The coward who plays with his hair.
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, and I don't mean to slaughter him.
Yeah, you saw him grow up, right?
It's a sin to leave him attached to the maid.
Go now and make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom, but it's not just that she has one maid, it's that she has two.
We told Um Aiyah many times, "You have no say, Kholoud. This is my son, not your son. You are not his mother."
Don't you have anything else to say except for Khaloud and the maids? I mean the maids and Khaloud.
Mom, it's not good like this. Kholoud is with the maid twenty-four hours a day and doesn't want anyone else.
Come on, get out of here and let me rest. I want to sleep. How am I supposed to?
Your brother, Khaloud, is becoming a girl.
Wait a bit, if you don't tell my father about you.
Hey, by the way, what's wrong with Khaloud?
Saud says that Kholoud puts on makeup and acts like he's a girl. Shh, what's the story, what's the story?
Here, here, here it is upon you, O Saud.
He puts makeup on his face. Khaloud, you are a little kid. You saw a makeup box and played with it.
I saw an anteater that big, and you couldn't even see it properly.
Okay, sweet, and gentle.
I'm fighting with him, Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Hey, remember that time you asked me what I would become when I grow up, and you didn't reply to me? Now answer me, what will I become when I grow up?
And you, my beloved Khaloudi, Saad will become an officer. What will you become?
This year we are going to London, same as last year.
Yes, yes, the trembling word in Bahrain.
His saying, "Let him bring Sawsan, Fahoda, and Khaloda."
And say hello to Samura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah the Almighty.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you a land on the sea or the land that is next to us?
I killed him, I don't want to choose.
My love, I want to live with you anywhere.
Thank you, my dear.
And teach me to fish.
Oh Amal, I wish I could just close my eyes and open them to hear that Amal has finished university.
Oh, what a heavenly fragrance, not for men.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
What's wrong with me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
You forgot you're a man.
And God willing, after that I will talk to people outside.
I can't believe it, Khaled.
Please get out of my room.
What a shame, Khuloud!
You fell from my eye.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son and I know him well.
And so, oh Khuloud, apple of my eye, if only all children possessed his purity and sensitivity.
And you, every time you see a sensitive and calm man, you say he is effeminate.
Shame on you, shame! How can you say such things about your brother?
That's enough, you've made a big deal out of something small.
What's wrong with him? Put some perfume on him, his scent is good now. What's the difference between men's and women's perfumes?
I forbid you to say this story in front of your father.
I have.
I will show you, but just quietly, so that Mohammed doesn't feel anything.
Oh, where did these girls gather from?
It's a shame you're doing this to her. She's a beautiful girl.
Don't look at it, don't look at it.
I'm really afraid that if I feel there's something related to him...
Give yourselves a break.
I know that you are looking at the Bluetooth that has spread these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, but let him come.
What's up, Saad?
May God keep you.
I say, "We're waiting for you. We still haven't played cards yet."
Why not?
Do you want to drink something?
I see him sleeping here at your place in the apartment for two days.
On the subject of Bluetooth.
Which brother, the oud, is he swearing by?
Afraid of him.
I'm not trying to kill you, okay, don't try.
Go back to sleep, dear mother, for my sake.
I've already booked.
I'm done, I'm running away. Where do I take my face from people? I have no face.
What do I tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids, oh, them, oh.
This is how it ends, Mom.
Remember when Kholoud was little?
This is certainly the result.
It's a shame, come on, just get up and go outside.
The truth always hurts.
The jar broke.
I'm impossible to live in Doha.
What's w
I have been keeping my phone off for a while.
And blame me, Amal.
That's you, a girl, spending your whole day at home.
I'm tired, and I'm a guy who spends all day meeting people outside.
It's difficult, Amal.
I can't live my whole life with my head bowed to the ground.
My father has been feeling for a while that something is happening at home and there is a change.
And until when will my father be absent from the events happening in the house?
My father, sometimes I blame him and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him, Amal, when I remember his hard work and dedication to his job, all in order for us to live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
Why did he leave the responsibilities of the house and the children to the mother?
We don't want to dig into the past right now.
Did my father know or not?
But I intend to.
Turn on Bluetooth for him.
But I'm not going to give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
It hurts a lot.
Whatever it is, Amal.
He found out through us.
Better than what is known through others.
What a shame, our home has reached this point.
Because a dirty bomb named Kholoud exploded in him.
And customs and traditions.
They teach them with all rudeness.
They plugged their ears to it.
And they don't hear anything from it.
Only one voice.
He is the voice of filth and perversion.
Widowson, all the best to you.
What made you think of that?
Suddenly, I decided to travel for studying.
We can only say, may God grant you success, my son.
May God grant you success.
He returned the gift, they want it from those who came back from travel, not from those who are traveling.
You are right.
This is the rule.
But for every rule...
Amal, get up, come with me quickly.
Oh mother, it's dry.
I didn't hear a sound.
Bos3ad
Bos3ad
Bos3ad, what's wrong with you?
Dad, what's wrong, Dad?
Dad.
Don't be sad.
You are a great person.
Any young man would wish you as his wife.
I never divorced you because of any flaw in you, ever.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
Accept an icon, my family's guardian.
A fag like your brother.
Hey Salouh!
Hollow, every day I'm here.
The first one, you don't show up at all.
Hiding under the ground.
That first one under the ground.
I swear, that's powerful talk. Are you up to this challenge?
You are pissing away one thousand two hundred and ninety riyals, I swear to God, that's a lot of money.
Say what God has willed.
Come on, let's go, come on.
You've been like this for seven months, enough nagging you're driving me crazy, come on take me home
Failure and scandal.
I told you about this driver.
Seven months and nothing has happened to him.
My ear hurts, I'm next to you.
Export him and get rid of him.
Send him away and bring someone else.
My understanding is that your son doesn't know what's going on with this word. He doesn't know the losses of money and time.
Teach him driving, send him away, and get rid of him.
You are the first day to come to my house. I am here before six months.
Okay, here's the translation of the input text: **Original Text:** زين بعد انا ايقول كلام واهد جديد هق انت **Translation:** Well, then I'll say something new, right? You...
Here is the translation of the provided text: This is oil in here, and give me one hundred forty-three riyals, in the, in the kilo, half a riyal, it is, in five riyals, everything comes expensive, dad.
Okay, you go and be a hero. Hey, listen to what I'm saying.
You first time come I come give not your money
Seven hundred gives.
You are very new, only six months. This isn't like the eight hundred (dollars/euros/etc.).
I want money.
This driver, you, are making old, old talk. You are new.
This is seven hundred eighty-eight.
Rouh.
This person is saying that someone will come and give them one hundred riyals.
Three hundred, there is no benefit.
Your words are very good.
No no, Chachi Padin, problem in and of some time, I in become lost.
Chashme Baddoor - No Fear
It lists who guarantees the money.
Why are you a coward?
This person is a laborer, first sponsored by the money owner, that is him.
I cannot translate this text into English. The input appears to be a list of numbers or codes in a language I do not recognize. As a professional translator, I am unable to provide a translation of untranslatable input such as this.
How fast are you?
Soof is not you كوف
There is no cow.
May God be sufficient against him.
I kept taking pictures until I felt like crying.
There is no one.
Even the phone I bought him has a package.
What have I done?
What's up?
They didn't fall short; they took his passport and kept it with them.
Get going, old man. You're excused.
Tomatoes everywhere.
Here is the problem, here is the problem.
After all, that's what they run away for.
They deceive us and harm us.
I told you to send him away.
But it's okay, do you think I'll let him?
I'll find him wherever he is.
The word "يتسفر" means "to travel" or "to go abroad."
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him away than have him stay in the country and collect money.
My liver is worn out. I just wish I could catch him.
Companion, shower inside now, no one is buying now.
At the beginning of the match, it was as if you were very afraid. I noticed this about you.
But they are afraid of what, afraid that our team will not score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified, afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not terrified of the opposing team. I'm terrified of our own team. I'm afraid that if they don't score, I'll tell you that it's more than three.
This is the level of our team. I know it. I'm talking about the level of our team.
That's a big compliment from you.
This opposing team has nothing.
The foxes are sweet, they scored now, you have progressed with the first goal.
Where are you going?
Roh Beit
In a car.
Come, I will take you with me, I will drop you off with me.
Oh my thanks, oh comrade.
Why are you trying? Our team, you can't beat them.
May you live long, the matches have just started, the league is still new.
You didn't hear what he was saying.
They tell you there are a lot of problems.
Yalla, Mahmoud, come here!
It is not possible to accurately
Here you go, man, take a seat.
Here you go, sir.
What has he done to himself?
Ah, the Indian boy.
Yeah man, he's a football genius.
There is no saying that this is the team's talk, this is my foxes.
Do it for Boko, Boko.
Come on, Sajed, come on, Sajed, quickly, quickly, the match is about to start, quickly, bring one water with you, the foxes are playing today, quickly.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club team, nicknamed Thaloob.
But they are saying that you won against them because they were lacking (players).
This is in the words, this is in the words, there is nothing good.
What's there, what's missing, this is the team, it's a very very strong team, and there are a dozen people.
And give minus two minus there is no benefit same same.
This is a devil fox.
This is the best fan we have.
Okay, on the occasion of this victory, oh fox, a final word I would like to address to the foxes.
Everything he says, I just stand there.
When does this individual become a bachelor, according to Tha'alib?
This is inside a high sky.
This is the fair fan.
Look, my brother.
He's probably excited like this.
Here you go, handsome.
Where's the Indian boy who used to swing the ball?
I haven't seen you in a while.
Uncle, this is a big deal, it's ongoing, it doesn't stay here.
I saw him a few days ago, I didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop called Starbucks in Flamingo.
I remember this guy used to sit with us in the cafe. He didn't have much, just a cup of tea.
Here's the translation: "Look, the guy gave the boy twenty riyals as a tip."
What did his father do to him?
Hey man, he's meeting with the big officials of the club, they're setting him up, you know, not being cheap with him.
I say Tha'loob.
My mother slept.
My mother says, "Do it in my room, do it in my arrival."
You have no idea. You support a crappy and tired club like this one.
This is the team of the foxes, the heart of my money.
You, when will my heart stop loving you?
Jud Dakhel Wajed Thalib Fi
You, may you live a long life, have not heard the poem that he wrote about the ruler.
The day we had our match against them.
Please please, you little fox, say say, this is a poem, say say.
My mother, O Allah, in the world, the secret of my wealth.
This is my money. I am in a lot of pain.
I don't sleep at all at night.
You know that we are the fan club of the Foxes.
It means you can't tell me the name of the winner so that I can have an exclusive scoop.
We have a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name in it.
Say that his beauty
And famous for Tha'loob, this fan who was honored today by the management of the Foxes club in a generous gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
By God.
Thae'loub, a thousand thousand congratulations on this beautiful honor, and it is certainly a wonderful gift.
Here's the translation: **"Snow, what do you call this in a pen or in a shoe?"**
I swear, he's a good man.
This is in reference to it.
I tell you that he is.
We have to report this to the police.
Sit down and shut up.
Fans, all, all, all this is in money, a fan.
No no, father, it's not him. This is someone who resembles him.
I tell you that he is.
You're late.
I don't know when the matches are, man.
Okay, now how are we going to catch it?
We have no choice but to wait for the Foxes team to play their next match.
There, there, I found it.
Let's catch up with Zain.
Dude, you're late.
There there there there.
Give him the right, the right, give him what's behind him.
The story is that we are not sure if this is him now or not him.
I'm telling you, it's either him, father, it's him.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "I'm just giving my opinion and wisdom that we go to these people and ask them. We say, 'The driver that you have, where did he come from? How did he come? When did he come?'"
Dad, you have to make this trip into two trips.
Let's go report it. I'm sure it's him.
I apologize, but the provided text appears
Registered in my name, sleep in my name, sleep.
This is in the second land next to his.
Go say your father, he will give you a son, Abd Al-Rahman Al-Subji, what safety, what safety, what safety.
No no, may God keep you safe. It seems we are mistaken, my dear. We came for someone, a friend of a friend, and we thought it was you.
Allah, glory be to Him, creates one person who looks like Him, and one hundred people who look like the first person.
Thank you, may you be safe, may you be safe, long life, thank you.
No, may God keep you safe, forgiveness, I forgive you, thank you, I thank you.
Here, you go, please accept my apologies for losing your license. It's not your fault. Please accept my apologies. What is the acceptable behavior? May God honor you. Here, you go. What is the acceptable behavior?
And you're telling me you're still sure, huh?
What's your father going to do to us now? God, protect us.
What have you done, Walid?
And I, while walking, pulled the luggage bag and it fell.
Come on, lighten up, the pain is gone now.
Get up and go to your room, get up.
God help us.
God help us.
Come on, now explain this to your father right now.
Before my dad finds out.
Shattered into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's go buy one just like it quickly.
Before my dad comes.
May God bless you, my mother.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he becomes like a madman.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He didn't do anything.
He accidentally dropped the vase in his bag, it fell and broke.
Mother, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he/she/it went.
lalalala this his father is not sane
Shame on you for doing this to the boy, oh my.
Amazighin qalboh amkhraa'inah Taboun ateynnoon halyahel hathi
I tell you, mother.
You think, I mean, where did the boy go?
Okay, if he does, I'll make a phone call for you.
God help us.
Auntie, I know where Waleed went.
Come, I will guide you to where he went.
Come on, come on.
I'm here.
Please, grandma, I don't want to go home.
Get me inside you.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear I don't know.
This is how your father, may God guide him, scared you.
Come, my dear.
Don't be afraid, madam, as long as I am present at home. Okay, father.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, oh Abu Walid.
I beg you, grant his request, O Abu Walid.
Because of you, I'll forgive him this time.
I don't see him at home.
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Okay, your father, Walid, is not afraid. Your father is not doing anything to you.
Of course, father.
Yes, Dad, yes.
I leave it here, but I'm afraid that one of the kids might move it and break it.
He recommended to me, he told me, "I want someone like the one you brought me, the one that Waleed broke."
Exactly, he wanted to go, but he only found this, the last one in the store. He's lucky. Oh, woe is him. Where are the children?
In the room, they are studying.
Oh God, protect her.
But these values, and I rise.
Oh, wonderful!
Okay, come on, get up and study.
Dad, just this game, and then we'll get up.
Dad, I beg you, don't tell my uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother, Dad, last time, I swear, Dad.
I'm calling him.
And you in particular, you insult me, your friend at the cafe, that's me.
Bro, if you know my brother, you know me.
That's it, I'm not connecting this phone to my pocket anymore since they're studying, that's it.
Mom, why don't you take him to the doctor?
May God guide you, mother.
Amazigh, his heart and what scares him is from how much he hits him.
That poor boy.
Become you.
Hey, where's Amoola? I don't see her with you today.
I wish I was with her.
My sister, this one never gets enough of playing.
Oh my dear mother, I didn't tell you the story of Amina and her son Nayef.
Her son is about the same age as Walid, may God protect him.
And the same height.
Yesterday you told me you didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband is Yousef.
I heard about the story yesterday.
And I was shouting at her.
He says, "How come you didn't tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
The boy had to pee.
He takes his son and ties him up in the middle of the courtyard.
Then he tells him to do it again and pee in his bed.
You are preaching to the ruins.
What did you say, O mother of Munira?
I tell her, "Eat, eat!"
May it bring you health and wellness.
Oh, my luck, that's it.
Oh my mother, oh my mother.
Good thing your father didn't feel it from you.
Or else I'll slaughter you from the beating.
Hurry up, go to the bathroom and wash up before your father wakes up and creates a big problem for you.
I'm not responsible for you.
It's a shame, poor things.
They are sitting, crying, shaking.
I'm afraid something will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to discipline them.
I am nervous.
What they dropped is important, they are successful.
Why are you taking them to their uncle's?
Nassour, you got me forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they bring fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
And frankly, I support his point of view.
Leave emotions behind.
My brother must discipline them.
That's it, bye bye.
Last time, last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
Let him waste our time. I assure them that this is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
I warned you, I warned you, I warned you, but you don't listen.
You don't listen.
Very modest.
Give him one, let us... let me discipline him, yes.
Yeah, okay, uncle.
So the next time, you review properly, okay, you go back.
Come on, that's it.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
And I'll take you down one by one, turn you into falafel.
Be careful that you don't go with your family to public places.
We call them ambiguities.
Mr. Walid is shouting.
What's wrong with you, crying?
This is an excellent grade.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Hey son, everyone has left, the buses are gone, you're still waiting for someone to take you.
At the school door, meaning he's waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the kids got off, and he wasn't with them.
Have you heard about that boy who committed suicide today?
Hello, may God keep you safe. They gave us the certificate.
And his father threatened him, saying if he doesn't get a full mark...
Walid, Walid, come back Walid, come back.
I greet you live and welcome you to a new episode of the program Without Borders.
Oil constitutes more than thirty-five percent of the total various energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
And the Arab Gulf states and Iran alone possess six hundred and sixty-eight billion barrels.
This is followed by Iran with a percentage of twelve percent, then Iraq with a percentage of ten percent, then Kuwait and the Emirates with a percentage of nine percent.
Each of them, then comes Venezuela with seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran make up two-thirds of the world's reserves.
to unprecedented prices and exceeding one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in its history
And in this episode, we are trying to understand many of the complexities of oil.
And the problems faced by exporting countries of it.
Despite the tremendous increase in its prices.
And also the problems that citizens and residents living in these countries experience.
Due to inflation and an unprecedented increase.
which will appear successively on the screen or they write to us via our website on the internet network www dot aljazeera dot net
Because today, the market is the primary factor.
And not the producing countries.
The day that determines the price is the power of the market.
And it's not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand have a part, of course.
But the other factors
The other factors are the political tensions.
In the world.
And real estate markets
And the markets, the, the, the pulse and others.
And they headed to the prices of F in speculation.
In petrochemicals, for example, oil.
And tomorrow a thousand dollars will arrive, and God knows best.
Oil in 2004 jumped from $44 per barrel.
And today we see that even the prices of petroleum
It fluctuates between one day and another.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it rose in the second quarter.
Especially entering spring, two entries, most of the world's refineries are in the maintenance period.
This is a difficult sentence to translate directly
Seasonal demand for oil decreases.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all of this does not indicate that speculation has power and control over the market now.
We thought a lot, meaning when we go back to the traditional market in the past.
The market was affected by supply and demand.
The supply and demand, the seasonal.
Today we see that there is economic growth.
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command, resigned. His command covers Afghanistan and Iraq.
His resignation sparked enormous reactions due to its connection with the so-called impending American war.
Political or geopolitical effects.
It affects the oil market in a way that is either negative or positive, very quickly.
The influence may definitely come to him, it will have its influences on him.
And even with his skills, speculators also react to political speculation.
What you might confirm is what you say, some of them might tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will the market be like? The market is optimistic in a way.
Question in the shadow of His Excellency His Eminence the Deputy, now in the shadow of the White House.
This has returned the region to an atmosphere of tension.
This is the qamoẓ.
But perhaps Falon saw this scenario.
A very quick reflection is appearing on the oil market.
Today, we are confirming with numbers that there is no shortage whatsoever.
Let me give you an example: during the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, its oil inventory increased to more than the average of the past five years.
It means today, no, I mean, I say.
And not even for the next war, because today I am telling you that even the world has a stock of
Even the global consumption today, look for any country in the world, there is a long queue of cars or lines in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What is the danger that this matter represents to
What number do you expect could be, I don't know, it might be.
Two hundred might be three hundred dollars, it might be less, but
It may reach a point if these tensions escalate into real tensions.
Because, as you said, the Gulf constitutes sixty percent.
In a country meaning far even from the oil-producing countries.
Look, the impact comes inversely on the oil market.
It can reach up to three hundred dollars.
And they placed and moved from stocks and others to the oil market today look above the two trillion or the two trillion dollars
Today we are going to see the print.
He works above the hundred barrels per day, meaning that...
Here is the translation of the provided text: "These existing tensions in the region and the anticipation of"
April, as previously stated, is to be the month for launching this war.
And God, God knows, I didn't mean my generation.
In the region because the the now
This is an election year.
And the current American administration, its days are numbered, only a few months remain.
George H.W. Bush launched a war against Somalia and sent thirty thousand troops in his last days in the White House.
We see and do not anticipate events.
But I do not expect that this scenario will be.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
You will not cost anything. You are the ones who will pay, you, the Iranians, and the consumer countries.
America today.
Now it has become dependent on African oil and has many alternatives.
Look, there's no point. Let's talk clearly.
You said in your introduction that sixty percent
of oil reserves
But now they are importing twenty-two.
From their oil, from the west, from the west of Africa.
From West Africa, and no matter what they import from any region in the world...
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and proven precautions and reserves.
On what is called deep water or on the act or on the production of the sea from great depths.
Therefore, the Gulf will continue to be a difficult number.
And Caspian Sea oil.
And I consider them like dreams because they are not the reality and the truth.
They are destroying it and ruining it.
The important thing is that there.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Therefore, these countries are a difficult number.
It includes and the energy needs of countries.
It definitely means that there is something called secure supply security.
And despite the internal US objection, even at the level of General Fallon.
But concerns remain.
From the time President Bush...
He, you notice that the political risks did not come from the Gulf states.
It means it came, no no no no, it's not the issue of generosity because we, there is no one who comes, meaning deals with generosity, we.
There is no dealing with great generosity.
But not in an article right now.
We are not a part of the charitable work.
Please
But Karam is generous with Westerners, not with anyone else.
Specifically with America.
Where is the market?
Where is the economic benefit for us that we will go to?
We will not.
Like oil and gas.
You put it out for generosity and...
I have proof.
I have proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
It's not the high prices.
The decline of the dollar, which you insist on.
You are primarily, as Gulf states and OPEC members.
The export should be in dollars and you refuse.
Changing the currency, even though the currency has collapsed, then
Although the return is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say seventy.
But the experts' words are not my own words.
Okay, the dollar has decreased by thirty-five percent, and oil has increased to a higher level than this decline.
This means that if we take the measurement year as two thousand and four
Let's see if the oil prices, I mean, range between thirty-five to thirty-six dollars.
This means, of course, it means.
The price of oil has increased.
But the increase is slight, like the deputy's.
It means if we take them.
So we consider it, I mean now.
Even these prices.
It means if we compare it to two thousand and four.
She even exceeded the percentage of the dollar's decline.
The exciting.
It reacts to the drop in the dollar.
The lower the dollar, the higher the oil prices.
And this is also something the market has started to give him a sense of.
The interests now are to reduce them.
Okay, here's the English translation of the provided Arabic text: "No, now the situation has changed. Perhaps it was at the beginning of the decline two years ago, this talk was being said, but now the situation has changed and there is..."
The dollar began to lose its value against major currencies such as the euro, the yen, the yuan, and the British pound.
The question here is why do you insist on pegging your currency to the dollar?
His work is weakening and has no cover.
This is it, this is it, a historic era.
Oil and its derivatives are priced in US dollars, and even European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It states that in the mid-seventies, America.
The U.S. abolished the gold standard for its currency.
This is not true.
What's the correct primary medicine?
The OPEC organization includes
Four Gulf states.
Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.
Today, OPEC's share of the global market.
Forty percent.
Today, if we take that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
While it deals with the dollar in pricing its oil.
If you priced it in another currency, everyone would...
You cannot as
All oil-exporting countries must agree.
From the adults.
Those who have sixty-six percent of the world's reserves are the big ones.
Taiat but I take it was for export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran.
And Cameroon, Angola, and Guinea, these are the countries that are organized under the OPEC organization.
Daily market share does not exceed forty percent.
Produced and exported from countries outside OPEC.
And this one cannot compete with the owner of the forty percent.
You cannot do it yourself unless...
Some countries have tried, but
Attempt not my right true.
You are the ones who refuse because of the ties with America.
From Al Dora to another job.
All oil-exporting countries.
How much oil does one barrel import?
They are the loss when he is exporting.
His work has risen very much.
He sells his oil for dollars.
So now, his money or the receiver, that's what's receiving it. It takes his money in dollars, and then it converts it or transfers it to his local currency.
His business is not tied to the dollar.
True, but he is.
But your problem is also that you sell in dollars, and your currency is not linked to the dollar. You don't have a problem.
My important question now is:
What is anxiety and the impact it causes? Your currency is linked to the dollar in light of the dollar's decline.
I have been involved for many long years.
Especially in the seventies, when the dollar was a very strong currency, a currency with very great power.
This disconnection is not easily done.
The paint is easy.
No, no here.
Divorce has costs.
It has the interests of these countries and is not against them.
From profit and loss.
Doogens announced in his publication yesterday that there are four countries, that there is Qatar.
But there is also a report by the Kuwait Finance House that says there are four Gulf countries because, of course, Oman has exited the unified Gulf currency.
I read the statement in Dungeons and I don't think it's a real statement.
He is the director of the Qatari Central Bank. He issued a denial.
He said yes and said that he will study, but also that all Gulf states must...
You must study profit and loss in a way, as I said, in a deliberate manner, without emotions.
Let's leave the matter for study until they come.
I will bring you economists who will tell you in another study about the economic situation.
This study reflects
Lobal House is a very simple and very tidy thing, and they issued a report on March 8, meaning...
Apple, four days only.
Global House, the solution is simple and requires a political decision.
The political decision boils down to two things.
There are no two of them, the first need.
About its intention, along with Kuwait, about its intention in 2010 to issue the currency or to study issuing the unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to disengage from the dollar.
First, regarding the unified currency.
In my personal opinion.
We see the unified Gulf currency.
The currency, the currency, when this currency will be strong.
You will be. You will be.
Maybe one of the strongest currencies in the world, as you say.
And what lies behind it in terms of precautions, and behind that in terms of huge revenues.
Therefore, we focused on this, as His Excellency the Prime Minister emphasized when he said
This is the Gulf because no single country can.
A stronger economic guarantee.
And an economic bloc today, even the Euro today we see it.
But you must not forget that the central bank has a very big role.
In the evaluation.
And and and calculating profit and loss.
From all this news.
Tense situation.
Two thousand and eight, as observers say, Global House said that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries to seventy percent, like the UAE.
In order to stop the inflation process that
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And this is my question now: When will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?"
And I will hear your answer after a short break.
About the topic of today's episode: oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
She has a reserve of two hundred sixty-four billion.
2.10 barrels
And you lose nine point two per day.
1. Kuwait million 1.5 and a half billion and a half two and seven tenths million
Qatar has 15 and 12 billion, and a deficit of 850,000 Omani. It has 5 and 6 tenths of a billion, and a deficit of 707,000.
Bahrain's population is one hundred twenty-five million, and thirty-five thousand.
And there were thirty-eight billion total revenues in the year.
From two thousand and three to two thousand and seven.
In Europe, a hundred billion.
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries.
The total GDP of the GCC countries in 2006 was 717.
The total output in 2007 is 799.7 billion, expected.
In two thousand and eight, nine hundred and twelve, and one and ten billion.
As for the inflation that is devouring the salaries of employees and workers who live in this region.
It will increase in 2008 to 3.8 out of 10.
Kuwait fourteen percent is expected in two thousand and eight, nine point eight out of ten. UAE.
You will become ten, while Saudi Arabia was six and a half, it will reach six.
8.10
Salaries are being devoured.
What are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the poor employees here?
If we want to address the problem
B. With real processing.
Salaries are always salary increases.
It is not the solution.
I am not against increasing salaries.
True, I am not true.
We are always.
There is, of course, faith.
The increase in the increase, and the lack of control over inflation, will cause inflation to eat up all these increases.
To address inflation, a supreme committee composed of all experts and specialists is being formed.
And now this committee is putting...
Because the increase in salaries in the world.
And the golden economic rule, of course, says
It will be endless.
And no matter
Salaries have increased, and whatever increases
This will increase inflation.
The processing must be done and must.
Meaning, in a scientific study here, Bayt.com, the specialized institution in employment, conducted a study in partnership with YouGov, the British market research company.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in Gulf countries across twenty important sectors.
Especially experts and those in positions, there is no job satisfaction.
Inflation has become a devourer.
Especially those with experience.
They are thinking about moving from these countries where inflation is eating away at them.
You are about to lose.
Here is the easy idea, I mean, and you put the easy idea and try to apply it.
The relationship of inflation is the increase in salaries.
The parallel in the subject exists.
Available and
We are keen, and the state and government are keen to the utmost.
Here are a few possible translations,
Always, temporary treatments do not solve the problem, but rather increase it.
You mean you add to it.
We hope that there will be more time for this committee to put.
All the applications.
Here is the translation: **Here is a falcon and you are its falconer.**
The translation of the input text is: The translation of the input text is:
True, but the state also tried and raised the the the fourty percent increases.
Here's a translation of the input text: "No, here's a very important point in the topic of increases."
You are in a subject of increases, you only increase Qataris, and as if non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You favor Qataris and do not favor expats.
And it is the high percentage in it.
Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not Germany.
She speaks about this topic and suffers.
Higher salaries than the government sector by a lot.
And conversely, we saw...
In the government sector.
And conversely, the public sector has become
The best elements and competencies have become.
I also read a report, and you know, in the oil sector...
For labor.
We, when we represent like our experts.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar.
And now we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the percentage increase? How much in salaries?
And hope is with God Almighty, but we say
The government has a plan.
I say that controlling inflation is more important.
From temporary treatment.
And we will see, and I am sure.
That there will be.
Positive results.
It will be in the range of fifteen percent.
The sweet one says, "I told you, five billion two hundred and twenty million from oil, and five billion three hundred and forty million from gas."
No comment. We are the client, not a rash client.
A process, and of course we...
The talk, the talk about economic growth, must also be reflected on the people.
And of course, any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa.
The massive belts that are in the country are also a part.
And if it were not for these huge belts, huge projects.
In the country, it also had a part of the inflation.
Inflation was also partly due to this.
This also led to an abundance of liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the correlation between the dollar and oil.
I mortgaged the oil in exchange for protection from...
In the United States of America, therefore, stability in governance is something that means...
Thank you.
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, O Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
The truth is, it's an episode that means it's successful, and a good title.
What I would like to address is that the region is now in the shadow of America's current policy.
America's policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural actions it is undertaking against Islam, there is a global economic war.
In Yiwu, China now.
And the American deficit also with Japan reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And also Japan had invested in the year two thousand.
With America, the equivalent of nine.
While it invests now with the European Union more than twenty-seven billion dollars.
In its approach to American politics, and in making the dollar an inevitable currency for the entire world.
My brother, I'm saying that buying now
And the region will become the Gulf.
It means, like, a place.
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Waseif from Egypt.
Hello, Mr. Deputy Speaker, with you.
The efforts of the MP remind me of the Arab rulers in the Middle East region.
When there is
When there are congestions or a demand to adjust prices.
Adjusting salaries, adjusting salaries in return for prices, as your excellency preferred.
He takes, meaning in Qatar, we consider you to be a model.
And he is determined not to preach about the increase. This is an Arabic style.
We want this Qatar, for us it is considered Abu Drika.
He has the right. He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? Of course, it is his right. He is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
The deputy must take into account.
One, two, that he should be in harmony with public opinion.
With the poor, just as your excellency has graciously stated, because these are the people who deserve to receive care.
The Arab rulers who don't care about the poor people.
Hello, peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
He wants to greet you two and greet Al-Aqeel.
I want a raise in salary too.
The salaries are excellent and good, that's good, okay.
May God keep you safe. Regarding the subject, regarding what we need to do, its meaning...
With the poor, and always, God willing, there will be no poor people in Qatar, and we are sure.
And the ruling makes it clear that Qatar, as he stated, that the money goes to the ruling family and to the ruler.
This is the important question now.
Here, let's respond to the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What is happening to this wealth?
Now there are new complete cities that are almost like the pearl of Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar has started to extend.
The issue is not the case, the issue is in the case.
Proportional urban plan.
In short, because there are only two minutes left, we will tell what Qatar will resort to.
Qatar is now there, Qatar after oil and gas.
There is, of course, a clear policy for the state.
Because she is not.
Depleted wealth
Because it is a dwindling wealth.
Therefore, today the trend in the state of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education.
Today we will see the educational city.
Today, this Educational City houses the best universities in the world.
Establishing medical cities, media cities, and financial cities.
Because today, oil and gas are not...
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels and
Not just Al Jazeera, meaning you'll make a hundred islands and can't handle the small one.
Because, I mean, my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
During the mutation in the seventies, now everyone remembers the seventies mutation.
Today, today, when we see the growth in Qatar,
This also calls for a special episode from us about Qatar after oil.
Our vision regarding oil, its future, and the wealth it brings to the region, particularly in Qatar. In conclusion, I extend to you the greetings of the program team.
This is Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without limits. Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
I greet you live on air this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
Welcome to a new episode of the program Without Borders.
At a time when Qatar hosts the largest American military base outside the United States, which is Al Udeid Air Base.
With enemies of the United States in the region.
Like Iran and Syria.
Its doors are open to leaders.
Not only that, but Hamas leaders enjoy distinguished relations with the Qatari leadership.
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
The one who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of the year two thousand and six.
And it is still unlimited support to rebuild what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
While Qatar has reconciled, and while Qatar has reconciled,
With her older sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, before about two years.
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanon file, where you succeeded where others failed.
Who gathered the Lebanese leaders in Doha, where they signed an agreement that led them safely?
To the last elections.
The files are also stubborn.
Which was interested in being the driver of these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab countries.
And in today's episode...
We are trying to understand the foundations and rules from which Qatar's foreign policy is launched.
And for whose benefit?
Tiny Qatar, geographically and demographically, plays these significant roles.
And what are the qualifications that enable it
This is in a live dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Foreign Minister.
And for our viewers who wish to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers, which will appear successively on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar
The thunder of Al Jazeera channel's cannons, a desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, from an attempted Saudi coup against the Emir of Qatar, in collaboration with members of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its issue that was published on the twentieth of last June
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the things that
I don't think it's accurate.
The accurate thing is that I, in more than one interview here on this program, I was always saying
Wan Hi, we consider it the backbone.
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then that...
and the difference in points of view
You created the borders issue correctly, and this was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations are distinguished relations.
If we observe these relationships,
[Between the two families and between the two countries]
It was marked by, it was marked by some misunderstanding.
Not by us and not by them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And now, the relations are in a position that I can confirm is very excellent.
For the benefit of the Cooperation Council.
But how was the situation of Al Jazeera channel with Saudi Arabia settled? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to the year two thousand and two.
There is an important point.
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, you will always find me saying...
Not only the eldest sister, but I was saying that our dependence in the Cooperation Council is on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And our relations with it, we give it importance.
There was media crossfire and this was clear to both sides.
This phrase is incomplete
Failed when the Muslim Brotherhood agreed.
And the private Qatari Saudi house.
They found, rather, that the most important ones entered into a dispute.
They have no stake in it, no camel.
And I don't think it was a strategy by anyone who got involved in this dispute.
But Sheikh, allow me, allow me here in this framework so that things or points are above letters
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera channel, in the last two years, has been...
At a time when the conditions that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still ongoing.
By the situations inside Saudi Arabia.
Whether it's people arrested, opposition members, or others, it's still ongoing.
Al Jazeera has stopped covering these matters.
Until it turned into covering Al Jazeera in Hajj.
To praise the system and and and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts
I don't see why you can't ask the Al Jazeera administration about this subject. Don't ask me because I am
The two countries
The region's stability.
This strategy has continued and strengthened, first due to the region's stability.
The region, you mean the Gulf region.
Gulf region
There are many important issues happening in the Gulf region.
Also, a call from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
It had an impact on all the attendees and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about settling Arab disputes, transcending them, and burying them.
Not just in viewpoints, meaning...
No, it's in the policies, and the policies are points of view.
The Arab world considers that this
A kind of war.
While in the developed world.
You are talking about the same interest.
Now you have remained for several years.
The situation now, the situation now.
Look, first of all.
There is a complete difference between this subject and that subject.
The idea that a small country is striking at the big ones and making them feel weak before it.
Every dispute or every misunderstanding.
He had his reasons.
And its reasons ended.
It ended with the wise leadership of the two leaders.
Are there guarantees for a future relationship?
There are guarantees for the between the two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and the interests that unite the two countries.
And the statements of the two leaders are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
While we hope for much from this Qatari-Saudi relationship, that it develops.
For the better, and there should be great opportunities.
Here is the translation: "This relationship is like what we have as model B with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries."
Regarding Qatar, it is an important country.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar even though it has been observed at the same time that you reconciled with Saudi Arabia
And three organizations are Hezbollah
He is Al Jazeera channel.
Or on the system in Egypt, the largest Arab country.
First, let me start with the following beginning.
The Egyptian people.
We respect the Egyptian nation.
And her interest.
Many Arab remains and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people.
And this is a case.
Does anyone think that this is an issue that we want to use as an approach to understanding or lack of understanding with the brothers in Egypt?
Under this, under the fact that you are saying, "We respect Egypt and the Egyptian people," then
And we believe that he is a good person.
Our disagreement with Egypt is on two points.
Or a point.
We put in that we prepared the coup in Gaza and I do not think
And we don't enter.
In cases involving other countries.
Do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
It means "Done" in any of your interventions in the coup carried out by Hamas against the Authority in Gaza.
Of course, it's not that there is, originally, we didn't know about this except like what others knew from the media.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas, and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt different or caused a disagreement between you and Egypt on this point?
This one is coming for me.
Hezbollah conspiracy.
Hezbollah conspiracy and also
But I'm talking about my country.
We were very surprised by this subject.
If he shakes for the benefit of Qatar.
The pyramids, what did she say?
The Ahram newspaper said to deliver.
To undermine Egypt and its standing.
Can I answer?
Let's go back to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this subject.
The beginning is not from the Gaza conference.
And I justify, I acquit of her the Egyptian people, I acquit of her the President Hosni Mubarak.
If we go back a lot to the MENA conference
After the Madrid Conference, do you remember the Al-Lusa meeting that was held in Doha?
And this was an agreement when the conference was supposed to be held with us.
They said that we don't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know that you have coordination with Israel.
From Qatar and that's it.
What is it that we want to understand?
We sat and went, we talked and the talk is always good.
It has two parts.
What are the two
In disagreement.
The political tendency
We, if we come to the Gaza conference, what happened?
Your Highness, I have spoken with all the presidents, among them his brother, His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
And we received news from a foreign country.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a point of view on this subject that is complicated.
And they kill people while we watch.
If you don't want to listen in Doha, we will hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it is shameful that on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference, I am discussing an issue.
By Israel, and the Western world stands watching the subject.
When we came, we said okay. Now, this is happening, and we have no power or strength. We Arabs cannot stop it. No major country has stopped this fighting.
Egypt announces its request for a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, and an hour later, the fighting stops.
So we too.
We should not take the Arab street with this naivety. Our disagreement with the Muslim Brotherhood is in one point only.
And this is in international customs.
And their hospitals are not enough for the doctors who stood at the borders.
You stopped at the border.
There was security, and no one was allowed to enter.
The Muslim Brotherhood felt very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national properties.
When we talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a humanitarian issue.
And we respect Egypt's sovereignty.
And our position became known, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We hope for a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that you can convey our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
For all other parties.
It means that even the rescue operation was delayed.
What the Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza from a conference.
Whether it's a donors' conference and such, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference; we were invited for coordination between the GCC countries.
And we listened in the Cooperation Council.
These funds will not be disbursed to any party.
But it will be spent.
To the affected parties in Gaza.
directly and this was
Because entry is forbidden and from every side.
I make Egypt happy, and all the people of Qatar make Egypt happy because Egypt...
Victory for Egypt in political matters is important to us.
But you are rushing.
Give me, just give me, two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted proudly about what had been saved and said.
And whoever bets against Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
I swear, I think this official has wronged his country.
No, they did not fail and they could only talk about themselves if we came to the truth.
Those who helped them in this, and this is what I told our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the King has wisdom in this matter.
The world is in disarray in the Arab world.
We agree.
The King decides that this is the interest.
We accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
But if someone says we prevented them, even that is an insult to those who prevented them.
It's like they are students in a school.
I think that means.
The intensity is at its peak.
It is believed that he should be exerting his power.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this subject.
If they believe that a small country does not have the right, and this right is withdrawn from it.
You guys are interfering in Darfur's business.
An Arab decision at the Arab League.
African and a decision from the United Nations.
I think the main problem is
The conspiracy of Hezbollah, Qatar has joined it.
Conspiracy, I don't know what Qatar...
It means if it goes, maybe after the swine flu, if it starts in a place, it could be because of Qatar that perhaps is spreading the epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar is able to resolve any Arab matter, we consider that an honor for us.
Because any Arab disagreement...
Any Arab dispute, we believe that it weakens our position on our main issues, which are Palestine and the rest of the issues that we face.
The Arab world has become a very big receiver.
Even our analyses have become the same as their analyses.
Western analyses
While Shana, we know him, we know what happened in Pakistan.
I swear, I really want someone to welcome me, roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone going to blame Qatar?
Has Qatar offended any Arab country?
You tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
Here's a translation of the text into English: "What's possible is that I pass by, say 'As-salamu alaykum' (peace be upon you), and you say 'You came to greet me just to annoy me.'"
This is a second issue, meaning you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This is an issue that concerns you, not me.
But if you have an internal problem.
We always say it.
And especially after the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah's speech.
In Kuwait, and I know this man, that he is honest.
And a man, what he says is what he hides.
In his heart, no no no, this is not it, this is the talk I always say.
I always say this.
I always say it, even in the midst of our disagreements with Saudi Arabia, I used to say this.
And go back to the document, all of which you have on the island, but
The issue is different, no no no.
From one side, we said no, we will stop at this position.
And we tried as much as possible.
I don't want to get into this subject.
Let them see their own matters, let them see their own mistakes and where they are.
Let's see, we made our own mistakes, that doesn't mean everything we have is correct.
This is His Excellency Sheikh.
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
And they will want to get out of it.
Qatar denies any relationship with any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally, and severing its relations with Turkey or with other countries.
We have a superhuman ability, I swear to God.
And they are, mashallah, seventy million, and if we are able to rise up eighty.
They also have a problem that they must address.
You played a role in the Qindi Shalit case, despite knowing that this file was an important one for the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "In a case that we see, we said, 'Brothers, this is with the Egyptians,' they said."
We want to see this subject with a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see the other party's view on this subject.
When we saw this subject, we told them, "Oh brother, if it's the same conditions from the brothers you are talking to the brothers in Egypt."
And this we announced, meaning, meaning, there is one responsible who says we, in its meaning, tricked the whole Arab university.
I swear, this means, it means poor guy.
That means, how did he pull the wool over our eyes?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains.
And we supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your end.
I think, I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island, as you accused me.
And the island must enter the media competition, just as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets where, during adolescence, they all curse each other.
But after a while, they reach the stage of maturity.
It can, it can, and it can be no.
First, we are with Saudi Arabia, and our situation is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar that...
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a specificity in the Saudi-Egyptian...
And also, privacy for Egypt with any Arab country, Egypt is the biggest and largest country.
That's right, that's right, but with Saudi Arabia, there is history and a relationship that is different.
It is a personal dispute between the officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian President, Your Excellency.
I hope it is confined to a disagreement in policies, in viewpoints.
I told you it's a problem when the attack on Gaza happened.
The second problem is that their important people have allergies that we have not yet discovered from anything that Qatar does or so.
Why don't you immediately seek to arrange a meeting with the Egyptian President between the Prince.
Saudi Arabia intervened in this subject.
And as is typical for a swarm of newspapers, they said first a secret meeting, then we found it the next day.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia.
May it be a definitive and irreversible separation.
And I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's say this so that no one later interprets it as "no, you are comparing yourselves."
But dignity is dignity, whether for the young or the old.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate satisfaction, the satisfaction...
Playing between children.
I don't think this is Egypt. Egypt is greater than this. I think he just had a slip of the tongue.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Here is the English translation: "Please, I don't want to talk about the intervention of the sky and others, because God knows who will live and die."
And here I am, calling.
Someone convinced him that there would be a method.
And our pride is in Egypt.
It seems there is no way but a specific path.
Either you support me or you oppose me.
A wound in which any Arab citizen suffers.
In the Arab world, we suffer for it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
States derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power. China has sources of power. France has sources of power. A small country like Qatar...
I swear to God.
The most apparent and clear thing is that there is nothing in it.
This is all nonsense, you're just
But we are a small country, in my eyes and on my head.
And I repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one says that we have allergies.
Nobody's gonna confiscate it from any of us.
You are now, in relation to Israel, merely tickling.
Okay, before I go to Israel...
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem? They weren't the first either.
And every day they file a complaint against America. If I tell you the major countries that you are talking about.
And they deal with us out of the door of interests and we deal with them out of the door of interests.
All complaints and everything.
In order to sabotage the relationship.
I think it diminishes any major country that does that.
And it also diminishes our Arab pride when we go running to complain about each other.
Everything comes and everything we know.
Our vision is to be based on Arab interest.
And we are with them in anything.
Are there any upcoming steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are intimate relations between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If someone who moved any matters
Despite the rapprochement between the two countries and their leaderships, he will find himself a loser in the end.
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe after ten years. I swear to God I don't know. I mean, from our side, always, anyone invites us to a conference, we attend.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
What we are able to do.
Because Egypt is our sister country, the bigger one, in any subject. But we have our point of view and we discuss it.
Here's the translation: This is all that's required. Whenever the time is right, we, of course, are pleased with this subject.
It was canceled because of this policy.
And we, as I mentioned, respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, canceling a contract and adding a contract - you are asking about how much to cancel, ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But regarding the policy of a country, we are like what I told you, the Egyptian people are close to us in Qatar, from our hearts a lot.
Now, on the past fourth of June, you tickled the emotions of Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office on the fourth of June, as published by Arts.
Why are you saying we tickled them? We, if we wanted to, could tickle them. We haven't for twelve years; we've kept it closed.
When Shannen was, when everyone was Shann, he carried it before they reconciled with Israel and before secret meetings took place between some Arab countries and Israel.
And after and after and after and after they reconciled, most of the Arabs...
Whether under the table or above the table, with Israel or speaking with it in any capacity whatsoever.
If we wanted to tickle emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's supporter Nasir held a banquet at the residence of the Israeli ambassador Peled.
Yes, he was a guest among many other guests present at a banquet. I didn't know what occasion the ambassador held it for.
Because we are at the United Nations, we sit next to each other with Israel, meaning no one can deny this subject.
Or we found a glimmer of hope in relieving the distress of our brothers in Palestine.
Now the administration has changed. The matter is that Egypt was a small issue for me, but unfortunately...
I didn't raise you, you're the one who raised them.
My question is about the United States and the new administration, and the impact of that on your relationship, you Qataris, with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There is a disagreement in points of view.
Serious about resolving many issues in the region.
And we, if they are serious, we help them to the furthest extent.
You expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar was in Paris yesterday, talking about what is happening in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with the United States is bad.
Look, first we need to put it in the context of internal affairs, because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections.
Before the elections, Saad Hariri, in this program, said that the Doha Agreement expires with the holding of elections.
Did this also shock you, or do you see that the agreement is still valid, or will you have to make a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for the phase that would lead them to conduct peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the agreement. A year and a bit has passed since the Doha elections.
We were following it day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
That we intervened recently in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a relationship with arranging things in Lebanon.
Always we are close to Lebanon, you know Qataris love Lebanon and go to Lebanon from from meaning
It means I am the first country that I can visit after a Western country, Lebanon.
Question: Quick answer needed about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi case, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
Or at least your intervention puts them on an equal footing with the state. Now there is an even greater danger, which is the danger of the south.
And we suffered from what we suffered from. This is the same going back to why you didn't stop here and why you stopped here in Qatar.
And indeed, we had a lot of pressure on this subject, but this was our vision, and this is the position of His Highness the Prince on this subject.
The subject of the Houthis.
And its stability positively affects us, and its instability negatively affects us.
We intervened with Bo Bo Bo as an impartial mediator between the two parties.
Or we signed an agreement.
But I understand that if this is to be exploited for other reasons.
And I will be with them there, and we always stood with them in everything, in every subject.
And and and and it has no basis in truth.
I see that we don't need to.
We sell it.
And I say this while I'm not sorry. I know that there is a large Arab audience that will be against me.
Also, thank you our dear viewers, hoping for your kind follow-up, hoping that we have clarified to you some of Qatar's foreign policy.
In conclusion, I convey to you the greetings of the program team. This is Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without limits.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Our respected viewers, may the peace of God be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, Prime Minister, Council of Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why would I say a special and exceptional interview? Because
Qatar, and this man in particular, was the main sponsor.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus in the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese will from both sides was important.
to reach results
It is very important that external interference
Many opinions or many suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese Arabic, international, if you like to say.
But he meant that he went through stages.
There is nothing to something to nothing, meaning these stages existed.
Does it mean the complications in Lebanon?
It has been a while, actually.
It means that now, you have listened and directly entered the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Did you discover that the Lebanese knot is a major knot?
A Lebanese, Arab, regional, international issue that requires significant decoding.
Is it very small and simple knots, but they were amplified by intervention, by the action of external intervention?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
The Lebanese must not allow...
It affects the security and peace in Lebanon.
Problem number one.
The external repercussions on Lebanon.
You suddenly decided, I mean after twenty-four hours, to take everyone in one plane.
From the plane directly to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They weren't even expecting it, meaning they couldn't rest for even one minute, except for what you are kindly offering them.
The secret, the secret, the secret is that we don't let them rest and think too much.
And they make many connections, the secret was.
Let's suggest the idea of moving them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you will gather them in many various difficulties.
And in many circumstances.
So we brought them out to these circumstances, to the circumstances that you are coming to solve.
If we want to succeed, we must move them away from this atmosphere.
And quickly.
God, help us in preserving the clear statement, the Venetian statement or the Beirut statement.
Then we were fortunate that his family agreed to go to Doha.
The two parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people believe, for example, that Qatar is biased towards one party against another.
And from Beirut, but...
This means His Highness the Prince's policy is that if we are mediators
In this process.
Okay, here is the translation
Did you seriously consult?
With at least the two main parties concerned, as is the case here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the Muslim Brotherhood in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I spoke with Prince Saud.
US supports the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud in that we
Everyone wanted a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If he goes, if I go to the mind.
His justifications are weak.
He had to be removed because there is tension between F Palestine.
There is the issue of Iranian nuclear.
It means the Arab League must have a mechanism for resolving issues.
It means the African Union is better than us at resolving issues.
And he is trying to gather the edges.
And he holds conferences to solve, so why can't the Arabs, whose university is ancient for years, not be able to?
That they unite the Arabs, or unite the parties if there is any, or intervene to support the oppressed.
He must study.
If we want there to be a renaissance for the Arab League, not the world Arab League, the Ja.
With him, the car is a tool for execution.
One of the officials here was Speaker Nabih Berri.
Cin Cin requires
Now, it means it has become clear that the Lebanese have agreed.
Honestly, look, I mean, we...
The first of them is Qatar.
It never led to a result on any given day.
For the benefit of the Arab world.
It is a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it in several.
At the United Nations, when we went to the Doha agreement.
The agenda should be to resolve the subject, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that
And their most important role in the Arab world as a whole, in particular.
In a precarious situation.
Let's stop it with our agreement.
Come, help us, oh others.
Because this is a serious subject and this is a serious subject, but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our arena?
In our yard.
It is very important that we prioritize the interests of our people and the common folk.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do in Somalia?
What are we going to do in Somalia? It's not a member of the Arab League.
Why shouldn't we try to establish a Sudanese Arab League, even if Sudan is not a member of the Arab League, and even if Iraq is not a member of the Arab League?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope that this is not a suggestion, but an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that first, if we are asked to do something, we do what we can.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And his brother, President Bashar.
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
This can be a passing phase.
We find or then, God willing.
With that, I insist on asking, if you please, can you play a role in this aspect?
Even if not publicly, now you have, meaning you gained some trust.
We always strive for any rapprochement between Arab countries.
And this is the policy of His Highness from the beginning, but this is the subject...
Could what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is local Lebanese. The region's affairs are still...
Not very attached to this situation.
I wish the opposite. I wish this was
The state of the beginning of a new state in the Arab world, this is a wish.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, Sheikh State, are you afraid that the escalation that existed some time ago?
At least from here until the end of President George Bush's term.
There is no doubt that the obsessions are still with me, whether in the subject of Palestine, meaning now the subject of Gaza.
It means we, I want to ask.
I don't want anything else.
He orders me to care about this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can't get them any medicine.
And food
electricity for the patient who is in the hospital
The one who dies if the electricity goes out.
It means I wish.
As for the Arab League, we agree on an amount for this matter, whether it's medicine and food, we call it medicine and food.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
The Red Cross will deliver it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to get into the details of this subject. I'm just saying that we, as Arabs, must deliver medicine and even weapons, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made an effort and pledged regarding the Holy Kaaba.
Because this is contrary, and only the other party will benefit from it.
Not to deal with this party because we will provide you with a solution. This is incorrect.
And me.
So far, there are no signs of a solution in front of me.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you anticipate it?
This is definitely possible, of course, we...
At least talk about the state of Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree on every aspect of their policy, or they may not agree on every aspect of Qatar's policy.
They mean, for example, that they tell us, "We do not desire your relationships with Israel or your contact with them."
Perhaps there are those who consider you to be, by necessity, a party through the American bases located there.
We know how to deal with this subject.
There are those who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It seems he met, consulted, or spoke with the Saudi family.
In Istanbul, negotiations are ongoing between Syria and Israel.
And I can say by chance.
The second topic, the Kingdom was keen to find a solution, and I was communicating with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours.
The negotiating tactic has changed.
By you or by the parties?
We, as the people responsible for this.
And from you, from all sides, and we locked ourselves in the room.
And in the end, we found ourselves, and then His Highness the Prince intervened, which was important.
And from it, the invention spread.
The era without mentioning it now has ended.
And it was a clear message when he said, "We know our size, our position, and our role, etc., as if..."
He wanted to play the role of Manon without provoking any other party.
Whether Arab, regional, or international.
But still
It has become a responsibility.
Whether you like it or not.
Some jealousy, some we want to avoid jealousy because we as a country
That these countries
You can work or...
I think this is going to be the comfortable combination.
Perhaps one last question, or before the last one: What is your relationship with Washington like now? Is it a cold, extended, distinguished relationship?
This means our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say.
It does not lack the fact that there are different points of view on issues.
But this is our right, and if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good is it, I mean, how do you translate it on the ground that it is good, your relationship with
It means if you talk about the economy, it's excellent. If you talk about education, it's excellent.
If you're talking about health, if you're talking about politics, then I can tell you that it's fine.
In your frank and clear opinion during the next phase.
In my opinion, we should leave the subject of confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop the arena, then playing in the Arab arena.
We are reconciling the Palestinians.
We agree on an opinion so that we can be a respected force.
I don't think that we have
That we be something effective.
Thank you, our dear viewers, for your kind attention and for watching. We hope to meet you again soon, God willing. With my best regards to you all.
Welcome, our viewers, to this interview with the Prime Minister and Qatari Foreign Minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to anticipate the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
To discuss what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue we can.
We would like to shed light on some of your questions.
The entry of Israelis into Gaza in a land
And our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Its dealings with friendly nations.
And sisterly countries.
And how to try to find a clear, strong Arab position that the Arab states
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
We know that more than one Arab country has violated...
Arbitrarily.
And no one was held accountable, while
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists.
In the world, we are the only ones we always target.
We always discipline with a method.
I think what
To the degree that we will not be able to.
that we meet at the level of leaders
We stop the campaign of discipline, we are the ones who...
What we didn't want was to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal approvals.
By a two-thirds majority.
But the goal of listening is not
We hope that our assessment is correct and that our perception is wrong, because the goal...
Solving the problem now is not the goal of the work summit.
But is it going to be resolved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now, the ministerial does not cancel Qatar's request.
And what was also confirmed by His Highness.
In his speech that he delivered, he said that we are not Egyptians. If the embarrassment is that it is in Qatar, we are not Egyptians that it must be in Qatar. Wherever the summit is, that is where it will be.
An Arab position that makes others respect us.
Yes, as for the ministerial one.
So we want to tell them that the UN Security Council resolution has been issued.
And Israel.
She was not concerned with the decision and continued and is still killing and bombing in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we are doing.
What are we going to do?
Will this be after Israel is finished?
The remainder of the Security Council resolution will be implemented.
Or will there be a stance, since Israel did not stop?
We don't force our brothers.
Based on a decision that considers that FAT.
It's been a few days.
We will talk about the ministerial listening
You ultimately support this proposal.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea and the idea of several Arab countries as well, who requested the summit: Syria, Yemen.
There's already an Arabic crack present.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "To all those who brighten us, to the Moderate Camp."
And the camp of intemperance.
And lack of moderation, what do they mean by it?
The West has divided us.
The Arab moderates, whom they call moderates, and the Arabs who are not moderate.
What we find is that there is a moderate nation and an immoderate nation.
And then we want to know what is moderation and lack of moderation. Is moderation walking according to Israel's plans?
And and ending the case in a humiliating way.
Or that we simply need to keep the case alive.
This means this is an important question.
The topic means whether countries
You are advancing Israel's plans and want to resolve issues in ways
I'm not saying that it's going according to Israel's schemes, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say.
Unless we call a camp moderate.
What is moderation in the view of the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain class of Palestinians?
Of course, elections took place.
I am not a supporter or a non-supporter of Hamas, but I am talking about reality.
The reality that exists is that there is
Idea
Some of those who are called the radical movement.
But we must ask ourselves: What are these radical movements demanding?
Is she just asking for her right, or is she demanding her right?
Do we sort them?
And we also create other blocks.
We are because of them.
Internal Arab intellectual
And this seems to be happening.
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Excellency Sheikh, in short.
Who prevented the holding of the Arab Summit?
I cannot say "prevented," as there are interpretations and everything, and the subject is, I mean, known.
The subject of the ban.
But the like I mentioned to you, we could have
We'll take a vote and get two-thirds.
But what was the goal, because it's not a challenge issue as much as it's an urgent need issue that we believe in.
The others thought it was not an urgent matter.
Okay, we went to the Security Council.
Or in a Security Council resolution.
But the decision is for the Security Council. Israel said that it will continue and then will look into the matter.
I just want to focus on it again.
What if we are not being serious in applying the decision to the weaker party?
What will be different from the first listening?
The subject of arguments means that disagreements and differences in views usually occur.
As important as it is
Are we ready to have a clear Arab stance?
From humanitarian aid.
It is clear that our brothers are receiving significant support.
And also addressing the Palestinian-Israeli party, we say to them.
This assumes we should discuss it, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab initiative?
Then came the forty-eight and we are committed, we committed to the truce of forty-eight, and the Israelis did not commit.
It is natural that in meetings, arguments may occur. However, the truth is that those arguments...
It expresses attitudes that express the contents within specific souls, meaning...
One of the altercations that he was aware of is
There are those who described Hamas movement as a riffraff.
And not even a minority.
This is a situation that happened, and we responded to it. I am from a brother, one of the ministers.
And I think that this means what the West says.
Although these are a radical movement, and these are a faction, and someone says these are so.
And we don't want to be men of others.
And that's why, always meaning, and I don't mean any specific person by that.
Any foreigner they find...
Or a Western country or Western countries you find
Among the Arabs.
Yes, okay, Your Excellency, now.
الدعوة إلى اجتماع وزاري ثانٍ
And God Almighty, his schedule should have only one thing.
Where are you, O Arabs, from what is happening? What is the position of the three hundred million nation?
A million Israelis soft
Which was followed by decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty.
The decision that was issued.
Israel has not applied it. Israel will apply it after completing the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
This decision is commendable.
That we request Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel.
And if you are asked as well, do they tell them, "We understand"?
It's not the Arabs' fault that if they are...
If the matter is so, Israel does not question.
And it is above international law.
This is reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the convening of an Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
In the summit, the Security Council will seek for us.
He needs to make a difficult decision.
to a decision
A responsible person losing their position.
We are the ones who scared the West.
And we are among those who strive, hoping that after they decide, for example...
I don't want to get out of the subject.
Those who carried out this attack on the complete reconstruction of Iraq at their expense, because they are the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government, nor ask the people who died.
There are no spells.
Exactly the same thing in Sudan. When they first started talking about prosecuting Al-Bashir.
His Excellency Sheikh
His Excellency Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory in the Security Council.
Here's a translation of the provided text: "Look, there were difficulties they had in the Security Council because the first talk was about a presidential statement."
The consequences.
Israel did not abide by it.
You will commit after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
Because they did not comply with the decision.
Excuse me, people are supposed to stick to it.
Because Israel accepts after the mission is completed.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All that we have done.
We unfortunately implemented some brothers with their own interpretation.
The siege of Gaza, participate in it.
I am a friend of the West and I do not mind if we have a relationship with the West and I am not
Against the West, not against America.
But these people understand the language of interests.
If you have friends, then you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
And in the end, our point of view, one percent of it is taken, and we say we won.
What is victory?
About what it includes.
I cannot say anything about any reservations now, because the decision is not
And the council is master of itself.
You participated in the formulations.
Yes, we participated in the formulations to some extent.
But you did not, you did not call for a meeting of the Arab ministers with the U.S. Secretary of State.
But I am sure that the brothers who went will be enough for us.
You referred to Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this field, His Excellency Sheikh...
For two years and until this moment.
Look, I don't want to talk about accusations.
What I can claim is that we have looked at everything.
Are they people?
An Israeli rejection, an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here the dispute began and the siege began.
And Israel, last month, during the truce, killed twenty-eight Palestinians.
And they prefer to starve until we exhaust them, because we don't want them to be in power.
Those are the parties, Your Excellency Sheikh.
It clearly states that the Palestinian-Palestinian conflict
It means if there was
Who created the Palestinian conflict? There might have been a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.
Here is the translation of the input text: "we say to the other party no you are 100% right"
I'm not saying that Hamas is 100% right.
I don't claim that and I'm not saying that.
But May, the mediator, is usually a mediator who is at an equal distance from everyone.
And I don't just mean the mediator, I mean us as Arabs to be at one distance from everyone.
And we don't want it to be present, and therefore we must end it by any means.
Once upon a time, there was a training of right and left forces.
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And once that we are going to create a positive model in the West Bank.
Let the people of Gaza see how others are living.
Living a very, very, very comfortable life.
In return for reversing that in Gaza.
You called for a second ministerial meeting, the Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time...
The discussion about it is still ongoing between Hamas, with Turkish mediation, and
This hearing, which you called for, seems like an attempt to circumvent.
If we took another initiative, it would be a circumvention.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this subject.
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
And it is required of it to play a role, and we support any Egyptian effort that leads to reaching an understanding.
But it is important.
We do not come.
Tomorrow, at the edge, it seems to have won over a party.
And there is no path to harmony.
A balanced Egyptian initiative.
Between the requirements of the international community, the requirements of the Arab world, and the requirements of humanity.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a pioneering Arab country that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required, in your opinion, regarding Egypt.
The current proposals, the existing initiative now, do they not meet those requirements, Your Excellency Sheikh?
I have an idea about the initiative.
We only hear bits and pieces of information about it from various sources.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the government or the Palestinian presidency, it should be present, and we all acknowledge the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people.
We must take into account the point of view of those affected on either side.
Until we can ensure that this mediation succeeds.
By the way, he took the point of view.
Hamas's position was clear, that this decision was not taken with our opinion in mind, meaning how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in formulating without contacting or taking the opinion of the main concerned party in the subject.
We only want to, meaning we of course deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with it, the authority. Let's say, as a single party.
But now there is a conflict. On one side, people are in one place, while on the other side, they are in another place.
This doesn't mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we should drop our dealings with the group that exists in the West Bank or the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we started to coordinate together.
What was announced, what was announced about it.
First, the decision is that he did not say to him; rather, he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered that it constitutes a mechanism to him.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative succeeds in performing.
The fighting is stopped.
Here's the translation: "What, I don't doubt them, our brothers in Egypt."
Because Israel did not accept any Security Council resolution.
And you consider that this decision has become as if it did not exist, since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things on the ground will have changed.
Yes, Your Excellency Sheikh, in talking about Egyptian efforts, Egyptian efforts.
Turkey shares efforts with it also at the same time and it was
About Arab helplessness.
Regarding Arab disputes that cannot reach a solution, therefore he came to occupy a place.
It means that it was supposed for Arab parties to occupy it.
I welcome Turkey's position.
And a stance that must be appreciated Arabically and Islamically.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
Therefore, this is the natural role.
And that people should follow me.
There is no Arabic consensus to address the situation.
Someone says, "Let them finish the mission."
It is necessary for there to be a clear and unequivocal Arab position regarding this aggression, its continuation, and the procrastination.
An icon in an Arab position facing it.
It means Israel is capable of intervening in villages. I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war. We are among the people who always call for peace.
And we are a country, meaning you want to live in safety.
But I'm not asking for an Arab war, I'm asking for a stance.
Clear Arabic.
In the context of talking about initiatives and proposals, of course you are following what is happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by the Hamas movement.
Do you think
As an observer, the reality on the ground is now that.
And the politician who was born out of the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions.
He has to be the one who is right.
Here are the points we agree on. This point, we do not agree with you on it, point.
The second thing.
They are not present now, but they are negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing.
Okay, in situations, what is required of Arabs?
This is the Arab reality.
What we witnessed after the start of those operations.
There is no doubt that the position on the Arab street is much, much more advanced than...
About us, as governments.
Of course, I'm sorry that some describe this situation as a popular trend.
Once they told me this subject
We represent the views of our people.
The presidents now.
It means if they want to.
At least they see what.
Of course, there is a high ceiling and there is a modest ceiling.
B: Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar Pan.
The office of the Israeli representative in Doha will be closed.
Qatar, which is taking this position.
It considers that the Arab side must be radical and take radical positions.
Anything the Arabs agree on, we agree on collectively.
Never. We, if there is an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
We align ourselves with our Arab brothers.
But there must be a decision and clear Arab credibility.
And they deal with others, not just the countries that have relations.
Even countries that don't have relations
Very important.
We will not be agents for others.
He says why shouldn't Qatar be a model in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want.
An Arab model, Qatar adheres to part of its Arab commitment.
like
And no one will go and sell anyone to the end.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
And I don't want to say our secret, unfortunately, I don't want to say "brokers."
And that's why it's very important.
A formal invitation anywhere because we must rise above this.
Some of them recalled the ambassador, some of them lodged protests, some of them expelled the ambassador, like Shفيز, for example.
And this is part of the disagreement.
But some of them recalled the ambassador, and whoever recalled ambassadors from permanent member states, five ambassadors, and all this is just movies on our people.
It means we talked about the modest ceiling of the popular demand.
With the highest ceiling, there are those who demand the opening of fronts. There are those who demand that Syria open its front with Israel.
Look, I told you, we call for peace, and we do not call for fighting with Israel.
And we do not call for fighting with Israel.
For fighting with Israel.
And how will we agree?
This is also not a problem.
What made us talk to each other, overcome our differences, and
I was struck by what His Excellency Sheikh said, that
Provided that countries do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
It means now.
The street will not have mercy on us.
His Excellency Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the war in Lebanon?
Do you consider that there is a difference?
No, I think there is a difference between goals.
It means Lebanon had land that was liberated.
The remaining parts, of course, under the U.N., are supposed to be a deposit with the United Nations.
Or something similar.
Lebanon means that we have dealt with the Lebanese issue in a major way.
Israel, of course, needs weak surrounding countries.
Until you become the master, and it is the one with the upper hand.
And of course, there are countries that are supported by foreign powers.
And that's why she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want...
They are changing this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon, you talk to how many sects?
And how many parties?
While Lebanon is... in Palestine, it's talking about one side.
But I would like to emphasize to you again that the problem of the Palestinians is that they listened to the Arabs too much and to foreigners.
Two parties, and from here the gap became, and each one believes that he will control the other party.
In your opinion, as an observer and follower...
According to the plan, it ends with a broken bone.
As Arabs, do we accept this, because this example might be repeated for those who resist.
Or he says his opinion.
Whether for the Israelis or others in the future.
And we gave an example.
The highest in obedience and in helping to break the bone.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text: "I'm not sure what that means. We have a saying, 'Me and my cousin against the stranger, and me and my brother against my cousin.'"
We are supposed to have any dispute with Hamas now, and I am not saying that Hamas or others are infallible from mistakes or authority.
They all have flaws.
Now I must, as soon as I pass this subject.
On forcing a party to their knees.
Because here, the failure will not be the failure of the category.
His Excellency Sheikh, Qatar, usually means since a while ago, it has been taking the initiative to provide suggestions.
And initiatives to resolve it happened in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur. We will talk about this topic, even if briefly, after a short while.
That we
We don't want to burden our brothers because there is sensitivity sometimes.
It's great that a country is taking all these initiatives. We have no objection, the important thing is that the issue is resolved.
Here is the English translation: "We are not, right now, our goal is not to put Qatar on the top headline."
This means that it was not one of the goals of His Highness the Prince.
This was his goal. How do we stop this bleeding?
And we stop this bullying.
What happened means it's beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
The sincere [efforts] to reach a dignified solution.
Speaking about the initiatives, it is useful to know where the initiative has reached regarding Darfur, disbanding the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum.
And the icon should be special in that it solves the Darfur problem because you see the beginning of the Darfur problem.
Arabs helped.
But what I'm arguing is a case that we have reached at the international level.
Based on the context of taking revenge against the regime, now we want to resolve the issue, but we don't know how to solve it.
And we always strive, as you mentioned at the beginning, in implementing decisions, meaning we are the best people to implement decisions.
Removing the issue from competition, is there also competition in the Darfur issue?
I don't want to get into this subject.
Before we conclude this discussion, Your Excellency Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will ban the summit.
It will be held. We wish it was held in a different atmosphere from the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
It would be shameful.
Okay, if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When Palestinian blood was being shed in Gaza, and here they are meeting for financial and economic reasons.
We help in fueling.
But it doesn't seem like anyone is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances, meaning I of course don't wish for anything to happen to us all except safety.
And to be safe.
But it means there is no one to take someone with his small pocket.
Thank you very much, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
Our dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how truthful are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
And what about our Arab region and the extent of its interest in this issue?
Here are some questions and others that we pose to our guest for today's episode.
Former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability
She holds a Bachelor's degree in Literature, Social Service, Sociology, and Social Science from Qatar University.
As well as a Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt.
And I have held many positions in the field of people with disabilities.
Including a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
The year one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight.
And Vice Chairman of the National Committee for People with Disabilities since nineteen ninety-nine.
Until two thousand and three.
She also contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for People with Disabilities.
About people with disabilities in Qatar.
Our guest oversaw the launch of many programs, projects, and media campaigns.
and activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed by giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Mrs. Hessa, to this episode with us.
The approved term is "people with disabilities."
In the beginnings, we used the term "disabled person," perhaps in the 1980s and earlier.
More educational when...
You are among those who receive that education.
In nineteen ninety-three, an important document appeared in the United Nations.
On the mention of this term, before we delve into the details.
About the rest of the regions, although there are regions that are not considered or classified as developing, and classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, the fact is that this trend is stronger there than in any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise.
The trend towards the legal approach exists in the Arab world. You will find it in many countries.
It is possible that the resources exist and the political will exists.
Okay, here let me tell you some statistics, perhaps you are of course aware of them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
It is largely true.
I saw first in Darfur and in Gaza and in the areas that are exposed to such events which are wars and conflicts.
There you shouldn't differentiate between a disabled person or a non-disabled person, as the numbers are large.
The illiteracy rate among children, for example, is fifty-three percent or fifty-two percent among females.
And in other countries.
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching schools, even if they do not have a disability.
The city doesn't even have basic infrastructure. Even if that school did exist, this child...
That he can get to her.
For the children and for other residents, it is
Such means these projects and agendas are wonderful, but we don't hear that they are actually very much.
Not unless we are talking about the International Day of Disabled Persons, which the world celebrated just days ago. What is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world.
Better than those people who don't have a disability in the first place.
There are organizations that arrived and established many projects.
Applies a very important strategy for health.
Through this strategy.
There is an overlap between the humanitarian aspect and working with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
There is a degree of awareness now in the Arab world that is better.
At this point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our dialogue.
Thank you.
I have two questions that I would like to ask, as they are part of a previously adopted United Nations decision.
The second point, what is it?
The laws of the United Nations that call for, for example, fighting the regimes that cause hindrance to society, to the child. For example, my son, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the system, as there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Crow, tell us from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Al-Saeed from Kuwait. Go ahead, Nayef.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
Good evening.
Good evening, go ahead.
Please allow me to introduce myself. I am a person with an intellectual disability.
It means, listen, Arabs say, a free person understands by a gesture.
And what is in the Quran, you say Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim, Glory be to the One who gave us speech and gave speech to everything.
It means I have been sitting for more than thirty years, maybe I don't speak, I mean a word or two a day.
Glory be to Allah, Allah made me speak.
He means he was speaking in classical Arabic, so he found.
It means an attack on me, exploiting the Quran, and that I am a hypocrite, and I mean people and so on.
They are defaming me and targeting me, and they are in the lowest depths of the fire.
I only got defamation.
And they do not distort the truth.
He who lives in a glass house should not throw stones.
And disabilities, of course, psychological.
It falls within the scope of this definition. The question, the question of brother Suleiman regarding
What are the reactions of the United Nations programs to the causes of disability, such as political goals or other factors?
Approaching various organizations and agencies.
To discuss her, convince her, and find out, sorry, to what degree?
Disability issues and topics are on their working agendas, meaning
UNESCO is an organization, the International Labor Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations originally place disabilities.
It is one of the programs that tries not to neglect children who have disabilities.
Suitable opportunities and schools
From the various different aspects, environmental and other aspects.
UNICEF as well.
But there are shortcomings that we must admit there are shortcomings. The situation in the United Nations is also.
What are the main points of weakness and shortcomings that you talked about? What are they?
For the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy.
Directly, I was present in my country, in the state of Qatar.
But it had bureaucracy and red tape that hindered
My work is particularly practical. Sometimes I've seen it during, for example, limitations or shortcomings.
People with disabilities struggle or try and struggle to gain recognition.
Until I reached a point that I was somehow satisfied with, you didn't put it in a separate subject as the global disability movement wanted.
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them.
This is one of its most important shortcomings.
The survey that was applied by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
As part of the staff or among the workers in those programs.
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies. We only received three responses.
Do not place.
The issue of disability is a permanent, stable, and continuous one for many long years, even though this issue is a human rights issue in the first instance.
In the recent period, yes, thank God, for two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least become raised through activities such as seminars and others.
Hello, peace be upon you.
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries? Who is responsible for activating these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and allocating salaries, for example, allocating a salary to the disabled.
Is there money allocated from the United Nations?
And do these funds turn into governments or into offices belonging to the United Nations, and do these aid really reach the disabled people?
And a note at the end: if there are no binding decisions for the Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmad Al-Halabi, you spoke to us from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, please go ahead Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
Ban adopted this proposal.
Which is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
You turned into this box.
Or a product factory.
Therefore, allocating only one percent of the net annual profit.
I return to our guest to respond to the callers' questions.
And he says that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
It costs a lot, and he is not able to cover this operation. So, to which authority should he turn?
He is from Algeria.
I think it is important to have a response to the needs of Mr. Naji.
Like any other rights, meaning the rights of disabled people.
All these are rights that this citizen must obtain.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal convention.
And satisfying the rights and needs of people within their national scope.
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations.
Obligatory for all countries, and there should be monitoring to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials in the first degree, there must be awareness.
So we must at least, if we work on these charters in this way.
Even if there is no significant commitment.
There was a response to the reports for the monitoring that you were doing, and was there interest?
But don't forget that the standard rules are a document that is morally binding, actually, not legally.
There should be commitment and ratification of it.
And understanding that these issues will be resolved or discussed or raised within the context of a society suffering from many problems and issues.
Naji Zakarni is the director of the Qatari Deaf Center and an expert in sign language at Al Jazeera channel.
At the beginning of the matter, Mr. Ali extends his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera channel.
The one who kindly just broadcast this special episode.
Now Ali is talking and saying, "I am very proud."
She was a servant for all people with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
And we support her and stand by her side always and forever.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them are unaware of this agreement because there were no training courses available.
Regarding them, especially if they are in schools, hospitals, or in government and private institutions.
It is necessary for this agreement to be published.
As if it were a law, it deals with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And this, I confirm and insist upon it, that states
This agreement is adopted and signed.
Also, like the state of Qatar and some other countries, they signed this document, whose goal is to serve people with special needs and serve us too.
Thank you very much, colleague Naji. Zakarna, you spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you both very much.
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, perhaps we can start with the suggestion made by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
About creating a support fund.
It is a donation fund that accepts any contributions from countries.
This fund is supposed to spend on activities that even the Special Rapporteur undertakes when he exercises his functions.
And even the Arab countries did not provide donations except for one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those obligations is an existing problem within the United Nations.
The box that
regarding the non-compliance by the member states, unfortunately, and the lack of attention.
And many people unfortunately say it with all boldness, meaning that we do not care now about the conditions.
It is a matter of fact, a matter of obligations.
Human rights
The human with the general wide shape of the "Al".
The marginalized, especially.
But that is why those covenants exist.
If these countries meet their obligations, but it's a good idea that the brother launched.
Add to that, it is necessary that it not only be there, a straight fund, meaning, in its independent form, but the organizations that already exist in the region.
from what it has of budgets
Apply for projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities.
The issue is always intertwined, meaning political factors intervene in it.
His state or government ensured significant support for him.
The number unfortunately decreased.
For nominal amounts.
The father is disabled in it.
Of course, his citizenship was withdrawn from him.
The girl withdrew, he has a daughter who is
From sometimes
Problems in teaching.
We travel or go outside, and we get a state of confusion.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
And we can.
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge.
I wish that the Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget.
Thank you very much Bahjat Karawan Bahjat from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, go ahead.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikha Bint Khalifa.
I just wanted to convey a message of thanks and appreciation to her.
In the past years.
With best wishes from the people of the A family, those with special needs.
In support of their continuous support from Sheikha Hessa.
A standard-bearer from Sharif, Tunisia, welcome.
Because there is another level, which is genetic.
I believe that there is care at the genetic level that reduces the percentage of people with disabilities.
In our Arab customs, it is always the case that the cousin of the cousin of his uncle
This means at this level, which is the level of disability. Thank you.
The comment came in response to what was said regarding the viewer's communications.
The truth is there, as you said, at the national level.
Be aware that there are guidance and support programs.
It is located within health services.
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
In the psychological clinic, I believe, and also in education, the programs of the Supreme Council for Education.
I honestly don't know if the Special Education Department still exists.
But what is certain is that it is among the health services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And his rehabilitation provides for these cases.
Is prevention better than cure, and he pointed out the genetic factor, marriage between relatives, are there campaigns?
For example, for awareness.
In this field.
This is definitely a very important and dangerous point.
And one of the things that I and others touched upon in many speeches and many participations.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, not only directed at
Implemented by the World Health Organization.
The same goes for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, and Qatar is among them.
And definitely Tunisia.
There are now binding decisions for early screening.
which was applied in many countries
This is all on the preventive side.
Do such campaigns receive a response?
The positivity, especially since it clashes with customs and traditions.
Of course, this is what makes it difficult, as it clashes with the societal culture.
There must be a decision, a strategy, a will that confronts this and obliges.
The issue of early screening, for example, this is a very important issue before marriage.
I ask you, are there statistics that talk about the disabled?
Especially regarding the disabled in the Arab region.
Extrapolate to the Arab region, meaning that...
F and especially
With the recent events in the region.
In areas and in conflict hotspots in wars, with regard to wars, conflicts, and others.
Every killed person corresponds to three disabled people.
The events in Lebanon, in Darfur, in many areas.
Not at all, it's not enough. First, the issue is me.
in harmony with human rights principles
There must be a means, a setting for disabled people, for their programs, and for the plans.
Ensuring that the existing agendas in ministries, institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations are included.
And in situations like war situations or unrest
Just for your words, the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and the strangest thing is that what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said, that the population statistics
To what extent are the disabled not included in the general statistics conducted on the population?
Not always announced.
For example, in the state of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I believe it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In cooperation with the Planning Council and with the.
It was prepared by the Council, in fact, and with our participation as the office of the Special Rapporteur.
If you could add more, add disability classifications.
The needs that are presumably supposed to exist within me.
Here are some possible translations, depending on the intended nuance: **Option 1 (Focus on
Is there a disabled person or not?
Exactly, but at least...
The statistics are somewhat progressing in this regard.
Peace be upon you.
My lady, I thank you for this program and I thank Sheikha Hessa.
But I thank God and praise Him that I, that I am Qatari and receive this attention from my country, meaning...
My daughter is now a student in independent schools, receiving a good education, praise be to God.
And I want to thank Mrs. Hessa.
and its driving role and its role that makes us not to be afraid and not to worry about our children
And praise be to God, and thanks, and a very great thanks to her, and to those who support this group.
Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dossari, you spoke to us from Qatar. We remain in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
My dear sister, the reality and what is desired, and what we are waiting for, is that you solve, you solve the problem of our children, the stateless.
Where is the role of the Sheikha in our Qatari children?
I hope she answers it, answers this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
And I testify to what the state of Qatar was providing in terms of service specifically for hearing impairment.
We had an early detection program for hearing impairment.
There is the Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even civil society associations, the NGOs, or other societies.
Because the reality and the hope, if I compare over five years.
What was provided to the disabled five years ago and now.
Thank you very much, Karim Nassim, you spoke to us from Jordan, and I return to our guest, L.
Of course, the the.
The entire society, its individuals, and particularly the families that have
Children with disabilities have ambitions and high expectations from any
Whether it is at the planning level or at the executive level.
But regarding one of the points that was mentioned, and it is a very important point.
Children who may not have documents or other things, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international agreement, like many international documents.
and a commitment to translate them into plans and strategies
That those services are provided automatically.
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, sex, gender, or nationality.
Okay, Sheikha Hessa, meaning she worked as a former special rapporteur. She was at the United Nations, concerned with disability. After six years of work.
You were wishing that, right?
Perhaps you did not have enough time, perhaps the financial assistance was not sufficient.
It means there are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through the organizations currently existing, and through the governmental institutions in many countries.
In the Arab region specifically, I focus.
There should be more research and larger studies.
We started from a global survey that resulted in more than one report from us.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously and significantly worked on.
Coordination between Arab countries.
And among the same people, people with disabilities and their organizations, because they are the ones who
But they have an obligation that must be
that they fight for him
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our dear viewers, at the conclusion of this episode, we extend our gratitude to all who participated with their opinions and comments.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Be with us through your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with, until we meet again.
Good morning.
I am so happy to have you with us.
At the beginning, before we start and ask the various questions and chat this morning...
May you be safe, Shaimaa. Maybe I'm the one who greeted.
The Middle East as a whole deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has indeed put us on the world football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Ali, please come in.
First thing, I greet the brother viewers.
And I tell him congratulations on the hosting and to the entire Qatari people.
And God willing, just as Sheikh Mohammed said, meaning...
Before a dream, and now God willing, it will be a reality, and work will begin from today or from the period of the announcement.
Did you expect that Qatar would host the World Cup in twenty twenty-two?
Despite the presence of strong files, meaning like America, Japan, Australia, I was not worried in this field, in this specific topic.
Okay, look, I will be very honest with you. Seventy percent of me is in Qatar. I didn't choose it.
Our file is very big.
Viewing actual global-scale blueprints that are in competition.
We were the ones, meaning we were up to the challenge.
Why be afraid?
But thank God, Qatar's file was indeed strong and deserved it.
Is it true that the file for two thousand and twenty-two and the World Cup and hosting it in Qatar?
So what about, I mean, in, in, the mathematicians themselves.
It means for them in this field, surely the joy will be very very big, God willing.
It means I like it this way. We were talking before going on air, but I liked that we could hear it on air like this.
At the moment of the announcement.
Where were you? How did you receive the joy? How was the shock? I don't know, tell me, tell me, you tell us and tell the viewers.
On the radio.
The whole world is with us.
They know that the announcement and this are F...
How did you see the international media?
Look, at the level of sports channels as a whole, no one insisted, especially the Arab countries, meaning thank God, everyone has provided its support.
It's just an announcement anyway, Qatar's victory, that it has the right to host.
All Arab countries, and it's not strange to them, this kind gesture from them, that they announced that they are ready to provide Qatar with whatever it needs.
Media from human resources, possibly as volunteers in the future.
Even at the level of foreign media, Shaima.
It means that when I went, I celebrated badly.
Include them among the ones who included them. It was the French News Agency. It was also photographed.
We also have meetings.
It means no one insisted in the first place, Qatar has now become, let me tell you, it is mentioned daily.
Hundreds of times a day, from the smallest spot on Earth to the largest spot on Earth.
I expect everyone will know about Qatar. Who doesn't know about Qatar? On the globe, it's already a thing of the past, even on the internet.
Its owner is the 2022 World Cup.
Every football player dreams of serving their country by being part of the national team.
Of course, any player in the Qatari League would wish to represent the national team.
So this means something positive that a person sacrifices himself even in matches.
A player should strive to be selected for the national team, and even if he succeeds and joins the team, he should give his all.
Whether in training or in matches, because the national team's logo is on his chest, he must give his all.
I swear, the officials did not fall short, whether in the care for the players, especially the young ones. This means they are teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Eating Sleeping
Tell me about your experience. You played in more than different age stages. So, how was your experience and what was most important to you?
I swear it was, of course.
I progressed through the stages in the national team, from the seedlings to the first team.
Do you know about the camps, with the clubs, with the club, with the national team?
So, each stage has its own special character.
Yes, Lana, mashallah, meaning you were like this, moving from
We have already gotten used to you, because you are Al-Riyadiya (sports channel).
Here's the English translation of the provided text: "We always see you like this, athletic. We wanted to get information from you and know the news. We want to know the sports news through you, because what's the sports news with you?"
Okay, here's the English translation of the provided text: "So, I'm being honest, I don't watch it a lot. It differs from variety shows. In variety shows, we used to host stars, but in their fields. And we also, in sports, are hosting stars as well."
Like Ali and others, there are also those in their respective sports fields.
On the contrary, sports activity.
What's wrong with you? We were the capital of sports.
Qatar, and now we have become the capital of global sports and football.
Instead of when you are in various programs, you present social, economic, cultural programs.
You have different areas, you have volleyball, basketball, different championships.
But then exercise.
Excellent, great.
I honestly wished for it to happen.
I wished that I wasn't now, my age is twenty-five, I wished my age was ten years.
I believe that the young players got an opportunity and a big opportunity.
And they hold it, meaning like they say with their hands and
What's sweet, God willing, is the word I would like to address to the players who.
God willing, it means that the young juniors who will have a bright future, God willing, in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you this is an opportunity and they should, I mean, utilize it.
This means: "This is an opportunity that came on a golden platter, as they say."
So they must be utilized in a much greater way.
Here's a translation of the provided text: "What's new with you? What's your news? What's new now in terms of the programs that you will present? I know that we brought you back a little early from your vacation."
So, tell us about your new things, God willing.
We are constantly in touch with the event. God willing, we will attend, preparing for the Asian Cup in one month, starting on the first.
We finished two days ago, but the Gulf Cup, by the way, Bin congratulates the Kuwaiti team.
The news is also available, meaning with intuition, we are keeping up with intuition.
Sure, I'm the main one, by the way, Qatar TV, meaning my first appearance to viewers was through the Qatari screen.
He who initiates denies this known favor to them definitively.
Mashallah, they convey the message of the media across various channels that...
Whether they are private channels or sports channels or other types of channels.
May God give you health, Qatar TV.
We definitely wish you, God willing, always success. We are still in this subject.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Sports Club.
And the fans of Al-Wakrah club, that from from
My childhood and me in Al Wakra.
Sheikh who was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser who was with us.
From the club.
I am still the son of Al-Wakrah, and the son of Al-Wakrah.
But as I told you before the program, this is professionalism.
It concerns every individual on the land of Qatar.
The youth, we already know that the youth love sports and addiction, just like you said.
How do we create a sports channel that enters the field of listening?
Media awareness, primarily meaning the media, has a very important role in spreading sports in various fields, let's say life.
You have the youth, but addiction is a problem. Currently, sports are starting to enter schools. Sports awareness has become a priority in schools.
They have occasions that they celebrate, any sports occasion, they make celebrations for it.
You have the Qatari street, meaning we see and walk, the signs in the streets, this is also considered sports awareness.
When the female element is specialized for it, for example, a place in the stands or anywhere else.
Here is also women's awareness or let's say sports for women's participation in the sports field.
Then we have, we now have the Qatar women's team.
So I imagine that sports, thank God, have started to expand.
And I also expect, because the time period
To make many projects and raise awareness more significantly about the topic of sports, and I expect this is a sufficient period.
If you study correctly and work correctly.
Okay, enough, and at the same time, we need to utilize it properly, just as I said.
Then there was a point I wanted to take advantage of when he explained how young generations can exploit the team.
It means capabilities, experiences, devices, everything is available.
Also, an important point is that thank God we are in Qatar. This is a widely known fact within Gulf and Arab societies, and that is they love sports very much.
How can I attract this audience to follow constantly on sports news on on the matches that are happening in Qatar?
And be present at the same time.
But most of the Qatari street loves sports, loves football, but the problem is attendance.
Here's a translation of the text into English: "It means if you enter forums, you'll find that the interest is great, especially in forums belonging to some clubs or clubs, the majority of them."
Great interest in the football league.
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution that you feel could even attract you to attend, far from being a sportsman, far from being a player?
What is the way that they can attend on the I watch the matches with your friends your companions?
It depends on the person himself, not that it means as a general thought or anything.
Some of them like to watch him on television or in gatherings where people come together.
It means, for example, Japan, Japan, created a big plan to attract the audience in a big way to attend.
When you attend the games, you collect points. I don't know what it means. They are worth it now to find solutions. So, God willing.
and the Arab
The most important point is that every player, God willing, will be present in Qatar, specifically regarding the 2022 file. What do you expect us to need?
Besides financial support, what is the job that you feel is most important and that you actually need?
And providing the means that can prepare them for the generation to actually live up to the name of the Qatari national team and participate in a big World Cup.
Here's the English translation: "The time, when the manager told me, 'Now it's almost over.' I kept thinking to myself, 'When?' Mashallah, the time quickly passed with the sweet ones."
You achieve the impossible and achieved the dream that we thought was impossible, but thank God, we are living now on the ground of reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, these are the celebratory moments, but now the work begins.
And God willing, in two thousand and twenty-two, an event befitting the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone on the land of Qatar and I tell him honestly, Qatar has now become one of the world's landmarks.
Hosting the year 2022.
And thank you to the elegant media LANA ALADI, we wish you all the best, God willing, and we will always follow you to benefit from sports.
Thank you so much, the joy is definitely in the eyes of the Emirates.
Young Qatari talents
And they are singing a new type of songs that have emerged during this period.
But in the form of a song on a music site with a fast rhythm.
And his band also consists of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
Welcome to our viewers, and our journey begins from this very moment. Good morning.
We are trying to take a few glances at it.
In short, we can define rap as fast lyrical music.
Its performer hesitates, and it is not a quick rhythmic singing of the song's lyrics.
Consisting of a large number of rhymes addressing a number of various topics and issues.
which may sometimes be personal
Meeting of emotional politicians.
And they are often controversial.
And quite liberal to a great extent.
And the rap performer, our viewers, does not sing the lyrics of the song.
He rather repeats them.
And the beauty in his voice is a secondary factor.
Generally, the sound is not important in rap songs.
And that's why he's not called a singer, but a rap performer or rapper.
And Al Rabia is concerned with the following racism in songs.
For example, the flow, the flow of voices, synchronization, for example, or delivery.
Oh God, followers, oh God, their audience, oh God, their lovers.
They have a certain style, specific to rap.
And I expect they will give you a more comprehensive idea than I personally can.
Good morning, welcome.
I swear, first of all, it was a period where we wanted to do something new.
We are distinguished by something.
Why shouldn't we rap?
Then rap means an art that exists in all countries of the world.
So why isn't it present in Tar?
So we said, I mean, we invent something new.
This translates to: **"It means we give him an idea, including a message."**
We will talk about the negatives and the positives that are happening in our society.
This means we use it to convey a message, first and foremost, that it is like a shroud.
This is an art form among the various arts, and by the way, perhaps this information is for the viewer - it addressed many social and psychological problems among young people to a large extent.
Every time, I expect it to change, and this is with the change of time, I expect.
I swear, the ball was a bit weak, a bit weak.
We have been singing since around 2005. The adoption was weak at the beginning.
We can say about ourselves that it is our new beginning, two thousand and ten.
In Tagbal, it is more popular and well-received.
She, for example, tries to sing and perform in the same rap style. During this period, I noticed this thing.
Yes, a large percentage of people definitely.
Also, there's something else we want to talk about. You established, in several teams.
A beautiful band, you've fallen for them, you've had so many concerts. We can talk about this band.
How was it founded and how did the idea come about that one can actually make a difference, and how many of you are there in this fa
And I swear, at the beginning, we, I mean, before the band was established.
Rap reached Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
It means that everyone, I mean, loved the idea of rap, that he would sing rap, he would sing and post on the website.
I post, Salman posts, so-and-so posts, so it became competitive.
And we met people.
So, it means we have become competing with each other.
Then, after a while, after meaning all these years, we reached 2010.
But in 2010, there was a system of groups, meaning this is a group by itself, meaning every three or four together.
Okay, here's the translation of the provided Arabic text into English: **"So, it's done. We said why, it's done. Why don't we unite, that we are all one group under the name Rappers Tar."**
Or in English, "Are there any rappers?"
So we agreed, we all agreed on this, that's it, meaning we said in one name, we are all one hand, together.
And we came out, meaning we started acting, meaning this thing, and we say this idea itself.
Approximately twenty-five people.
Twenty-five wow, mashallah, a big group.
Okay, is there anyone who plays an instrument or raps? Everyone performs rap songs.
He is the one who coordinates, and he is the one who composes the music.
You can say something personal.
How is this number arranged in the band? Excellent. How are the twenty-five arranged?
Everyone is concerned with himself, and he has his own capabilities.
It means that each person from the band can do a full song.
Without seeking help from anyone else.
But in it, the competencies can differ, for example, if Salman, he is better than me.
Someone hears her and tells me no, correct the words here, change something.
Can everyone edit each other?
Let's help each other a bit.
Until there is actually an official entity that adopts these works, or even a company for example that adopts them.
And it has correct distributors.
It means that the work should appear in a certain style, meaning elegant, and actually be something formal for you.
We really wish for honesty, meaning we wish for support so that we actually receive support, meaning they tell us a company will adopt us and say to us, "Okay, we will go down and produce an album for you."
We don't have any problem, I mean.
Some things are a little difficult.
Therefore, why don't you think about it as the first initiative that comes from you?
Until one just gets to know the first CD.
This way you can attract potential partners later, what do you think?
In the year 2007, approximately, I made a CD.
I swear I distributed it to the guys.
How was the turnout?
By God.
Text text because two thousand and seven perhaps a little rap art not not possible continue strongly in the Gulf
But not too strongly now.
Okay, here's the English translation of the Arabic text you provided: "We were sitting, talking, before we went on the air. I mean, for example, you hear a large group of guys between Valencia and Qiyasat, for example."
Let's talk about it.
They told us, "We are arranging a party for you."
And it means they covered all the costs and all the procedures, and the coordination was, I mean, the work was, honestly, I mean, we did not expect this level to be.
Frankly, we were surprised, and the work was wonderful.
And that's it, there was some pressure, meaning there were no ads, there was nothing, meaning the party.
There were no ads, nothing, meaning two days before the concert.
So we said, meaning no one will come, meaning a party two days before the announcement, no one will come.
We were inside, I mean, before the party started.
This means this is a point in our favor.
So we mean that our voice reaches the families, not the youth.
Our perspective is that, we expected that the idea is just a right for the youth.
It means we discovered at this stage that there is, I mean, a category, I mean, more than one category listening to us.
There was a certain song that had great interaction with the audience and the band.
Most songs had interaction.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "No, it's almost most of the songs, but because the songs were more, and we were a large number."
The group means approximately the entire group.
What are the words? How do I treat different issues?
We're talking about the situation we're in, but what we're in came very quickly.
At least grill it, even if it's a lot.
Even if they spoke before, it wouldn't be me.
It seems you have to extract the the the the sentences are random
That means, that means, the rhyme comes out.
It means we thought about it, we write this, no, we write this word, this is better.
Okay, we have a song, let's see it.
From one of the songs that you made.
And we follow it and and we also see the opinion of the public on this topic.
And God willing, I hope they also enjoy such words.
Thank you, I liked the introduction because it has the name of my program.
With you, KD, and DJ Mister Bobo on the program "Good Morning Doha."
Good morning, good morning ladies and gentlemen.
This key Mr. Popo with ask tea one hot to be.
And don't forget, the program is shown at 9:30 in the morning, meaning everyone is sitting in front of the television.
With us in the preparation is Hassan Na'ama. With us in the presentation is Shaima Al Hammadi.
With us in the directing is Nasser Al-Maliki. The guests of the episode are rappers of Qatar, of course.
Because it actually contains the name of the family. Thank you, guys. May God give you health.
I apologize, I have to applaud you, I swear by the youth above in the control room.
Last night it was recorded.
And it means, who among you wrote the lyrics or who?
Everyone should write their own words.
Because if I came to write lyrics for Yousef.
Not only does he write these words, there is love for singing, love for emotion.
I expect you should write in the World Cup two thousand and twenty-two and the Asian Cup. I expect it's possible to include it, right or wrong?
We are definitely talking about ourselves, meaning we are definitely releasing a song, so regarding this matter...
But I want it to be official or high, so a little bit.
So I think there should be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of rapping, which is indeed a true art form.
Yes, I expect that today we are all waiting for that
We see it live on air right now.
And of course this cup arrived and decorated the streets of Doha.
If our viewers, as we saw, Doha is getting ready to welcome the Asian Cup.
And the concerned parties have finished all arrangements to be ready to receive.
The cup was not expected, and of course there was definitely a bigger crowd than what we saw.
Just a while ago, I think the length of the Corniche from beginning to end...
Surely they are important in receiving this important sporting event.
There are upcoming parties, God willing, that we will follow in the coming days, God willing.
Someone contacted us saying they would arrange a party for us.
But so far, things are, I mean, a little, I mean, there's some complexity in them.
The procedures, and this is not certain.
So we try to, I mean, for example, I saw Youssef and I saw someone else.
And I saw several people I have, I want them, I have a subject, a song, and I saw the three.
They are suitable for the song.
And the possibility that we can sing it.
I prefer to be at home.
And then I will send it to Yousef via email on the internet.
This part of the song is for you, Youssef.
There's also something else: you'll travel abroad.
They entered this field and became, you know, millions of fans.
We don't try to imitate, but one listens, meaning to what is better.
But he means to be a strong competitor with his style.
So what prevents me from taking ideas from them, imitating them in things?
Okay, here's the translation of the Arabic text: "But I mean, reverse it, I mean, take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song, in a different way."
They made them a special team and they have more than one CD about people.
He spoke about a person named Abdullah Al-Dayel.
He has experience and the ability to discover groundwater.
This translates to: **And it lies in their ability to detect groundwater aquifers.**
A resident of the city of Murat.
There are a lot of experienced people.
To locate water sources before drilling wells.
And he may need or he may drill many wells and there is no water.
Utilizing copper rods or pomegranate branches.
Or figs, from which one can infer the locations of water sources.
What tools does he use?
Al-Mak, the water detector, discovered groundwater.
This is the old .
But now it has been replaced with copper bars.
Now we place the two rods parallel to each other.
And we are walking now at steps that are not hurried, a light walk.
We see when we pass by a watercourse.
If the rods open.
Now, now, we are passing through now in this form, now we are passing over a watercourse.
It has now opened in this form.
When we cross it, the game starts.
This is now in the middle of the watercourse.
And and from the and from here it will be the middle.
So with this method now, we can determine the width of the water channel or the water channel that is under the ground.
And of course, the process is repeated more than once in more than one location until we find the strongest location.
Abu Ibrahim confirms.
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession.
To become his discoveries very accurate.
In the Marat area and outside Marat, in Shaqra, in Aharmelah, in Uthaina.
And more than one hundred and fifty wells were discovered.
The error rate was five percent, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God Almighty.
Exceeding modern devices and laboratories.
And in a very short standard time.
Abdulrahman Al Murshed
For the "Good Morning Doha" program.
The city of Murat is located in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
And we followed up on this report, and we promise you, God willing, with other reports from Arab and international countries.
and a Gulf one, God willing.
We have now reached different headlines and titles with you, our viewers, but they all have their meaning.
The big one and the first title and.
So I expect there is a large group of young Gulf people in the Gulf itself.
Are there specific people you look up to?
However, it means for example, you don't imitate them, but you feel that it is necessary to follow their works firsthand.
By God, they are the rappers of the Gulf in general, and there is a connection between them.
Okay, here's the translation of the Arabic text into English: "So, it means, not a competitor, competitions that are, meaning, I released a song."
And I talked about the subject.
It means that it will be a competition, as you say, a purposeful one.
There should be a connection between us, and there is, I mean, just one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusay is doing great, ماشاء الله, he's creating a buzz.
He became very popular, he started making CDs, and he gained his own audience.
And he became... more than one company is possible to adopt him.
You wish you could reach this stage, or even perhaps surpass this stage by much more, God willing.
God willing, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this group.
Of course, there is a presence, and a reception for this important sports cup, the Asia Cup. Let's see the shots that are present on the Corniche.
And in addition to a group of young Qataris
What moves, if it's from the west, but with a Gulf style.
Also, emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished band of twenty-five people.
It is necessary for one to follow your news first hand.
So I think you should have an email, you should have a specific website on the internet or a forum.
So how can one reach you?
And God, he was with us a while ago, we had our own website.
But if there are some problems with the company, the hosting company.
So he meant sometimes he gets drunk, sometimes he doesn't know what.
So basically, we faced problems with it, and finally, we just closed it.
So it's inevitable, the site is locked down, locked down.
Okay, now what is the alternative currently until they solve this problem, because as a band...
UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even Morocco or Egypt.
One should communicate with you, know your news, and see the songs that you produce from time to time.
What's the alternative now?
Currently, the alternative is relying on private pages, for example.
What exactly in the name of?
He said, "No, Jufi, when you do a search, but only on Google."
In the name of Qatar rap or Qatar rappers.
Do you make music videos even when you are alone?
For the program, yesterday you worked on it.
We uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
Song and I'm filming.
A song and the same look, in the form of a video, but I film one after the other.
I expect that we should see you develop even more like this.
You need a place to gather, in addition to each person having their own device at home.
And the mixer, the computer, the piano, the guitar.
Honestly, I mean, I wish that, I mean, we get support.
It means, for example, a company means
We produce CDs for you.
I'll make a special place for you.
From ourselves.
But in the end, we remain, meaning, it's personal work.
We don't want this to be personal.
My words are no different from Youssef's words.
We definitely need a video clip.
And the album...
I think the spread force in the video clip, I expect it's very important.
Because he delivers the information better.
If support is present, everything comes with it.
Your beautiful voices reach everywhere.
It means it is considered one of the various arts that address problems and address issues.
Thank you to Yousef Al Nuaimi and Salman Al Abdullah for being with us.
Let's see them and wish them, of course, all the best. In the name of our program, good luck to the youth.
This project was, yes.
There is also another project that is almost ready, but it needs some technical development for it.
Expiration date, price.
You deliver to the cashier. You have the total, you have all the details and you are ready.
And getting to know the merchandise instead of holding each part and seeing the components and their harms.
He's going in the trolley.
One can choose the exact material they want.
Of course, most of the projects, meaning, came as a reflection of the child's feeling of a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center currently means in the group of programs that it designs and the events that are based on a main idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikha Mozah in her founding of the center.
It's possible, it's possible that I also...
He goes down directly to underneath. Move under the ground. He goes down to the train under the ground from his house.
But its main idea is that it is clothing.
Show me all the stores in Qatar that have black T-shirts.
Here's a translation of the input text: "Will there also be a house key, a car key? I have a button, I press it."
Show me if I press it, it's lost from me, it will take me to the key that
Yes, we will return again to the projects that you will be undertaking, God willing, through the Cultural Center.
And here is early childhood education.
And develops its skills and nurtures the talented.
So we move between, meaning a range of children's skills, whether they are media-related or research-related.
If the personal skills in speaking to the public and convincing the public
Given the diversity of all these skills, we develop a special program for them that serves them.
We started from the future's media and accomplished a great achievement in it. Now we have reached graduation projects and their end.
We also reached a large number of child speakers, young children.
And their creativity.
You have young broadcasters as well.
He returned to television, meaning it's necessary that they present children's programs.
We are sitting, we are counting them for television.
Through their television, Qatar TV.
We prepare them for this now, meaning we end up with them until they are eighteen years old.
Welcome to them wherever they are, yes.
This also means the national television.
And our need to attract or gain and discover these talents and develop them.
From media to research.
This is a difficult and potentially nonsensical
To reading, to many diverse fields.
There is some cooperation between you, taking ideas from each other.
In every field, for example, the Khateeb Al-Waed program with the Ministry of Endowments.
Our exhibition, the Generations Exhibition, this is also.
The Scientific Club played a significant role in developing projects and also providing technical support for these projects.
The Supreme Council for Education also plays the biggest role, and their support for schools, and their partnership.
Mr. Abdullah, your move to Katara, this great edifice.
Which also collects a large group of wonderful events and clubs.
Is this considered a big push for the center itself?
You take a building like this, separate.
Far from this great edifice.
And he gave us an interface to deal with the public more easily, meaning...
And pioneering projects as well, and good ones.
And in many of the guest receptions, and introducing them to the nature of the programs that are presented, the cultural programs that are presented to the child.
Because our main project during these three years is.
It is the national project for developing reading among children.
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
She adopted this project and provided it with substantial, very significant support.
This is a major project focused on developing children's reading and storytelling skills, and enhancing their abilities.
The various cultural aspects that are related to reading in particular.
There are of course many programs.
This means that we recently moved.
And Badi now means rearranging the some means now the activities
And design it and develop it so that it fits the nature of the visitors, meaning Katara.
We certainly wish you all the best, God willing, through this center.
What gathers within its folds are ideas that are very important.
Of course, first of all, we thank you for this generous hospitality.
The most important thing honestly is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover about our own children.
It means that today's children are different from yesterday's children, their childhood is different from our childhood.
They need us to give more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough listening for his interest and for his imagination.
And I communicate with him intellectually.
They work, meaning their way of dealing with children is like a hotel that provides them with accommodation.
Or it is like a bank that provides him with money.
The child lacks someone to listen to these thoughts, to listen to this imagination.
And we actually lived, they moved us now during the past days in the exhibition, they moved us to twenty, thirty.
Through this exhibition
We wish success, God willing, to the projects that won awards.
Thank you for attending with us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, God willing.
Until these projects actually materialize and are present in reality, and are not just a constant dream.
Welcome to our viewers. The Cultural Center for Childhood concluded its activities on the evening of Monday, the day before yesterday, at the Diplomatic Club.
The events of the National Exhibition for the Dreams of Generations under the slogan: The dreams of generations are the realities of the homeland of tomorrow.
The event was organized on the occasion of the country's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
The exhibition witnessed various activities and different competitions for our viewers.
And innovative projects for children.
Generally speaking, on behalf of our viewers, we are pleased to host Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Children. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, welcome, my dear sister.
At the beginning, I thank you for giving time to the center.
Let's talk about this distinctive exhibition, truly.
We are also pleased with your presence through the program so that we can cover as much as possible all the events that took place through this exhibition.
This is the National Exhibition of Generations' Dreams.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this exhibition.
Contribution of the Childhood Cultural Center
For the National Day celebrations.
And he had a very important stand, he had a very important touch with every child.
With the aim of empowering children.
It is difficult to provide
And with the project
This project or dream.
In children's dreams, their imaginations are vast.
Its fields are broad. We defined them within a framework, which is Qatar's 2030.
And other key areas of Qatar's Vision 2030.
We started training children in four stages.
And how do brainstorming mechanisms and toolkit mechanisms expand a child's thinking?
What do you specifically mean by this sentence?
They are the facts of the homeland of tomorrow.
meaning that what our children dream of today
This project is growing and expanding with this project.
This was truly a means, an explanation for this vision, that the children begin to live from this day.
I dream big.
If it's an environmental field or a field, for example, in the field of health and human development and other fields.
That serves the homeland.
I expect that when we know there are children in a specific place.
Or at a certain exhibition.
So, was all of this present during...
The exhibition had honorary guests for the exhibition.
Honored guests are the ones until children learn from them as role models.
The big Arab fall was two or three weeks ago.
And there were also winners in different awards across the Arab world.
There was a schedule for them to present their projects.
Yes, and the photos are surely a witness to your talk, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were present in the exhibition, of course, with various different events and activities.
This is also the owner of the the last project owner of the forest.
Innovative or Creative
This is one of the children's innovations, mashallah, meaning it's a very beautiful idea that we can simplify for the viewer.
And we'll tell it a little. What is this subject exactly, the colored ball?
So, approximately four or five projects spoke about this topic, including the colored ball.
Or is it also called the smart stadium?
This ball, if it goes out of the field.
Its color changes.
We came back like I expect in the matches more largely in the future, God willing.
Okay, what comes after these dreams, I mean.
That it is also related to a need, meaning, related to his interests.
And I expect that, especially when there are people in charge, they take into consideration these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects might actually serve us. Okay, the head of the football federation is here in Qatar.
What does he think about the idea of colored balls?
Did he like the idea?
He was very generous, and the price of his visit, of course, and he stood by the projects that were allocated to the ball.
A serious stance and the adoption of these projects on the spot.
A big exhibition moment where these projects are adopted.
The audience also voted for a wide range of projects that our children presented.
And our loved ones, okay, what are the projects that we can say there was so and so, more highlighting, and they voted on
Of course, we have the method of evaluation. There is an evaluation committee that has a main method of evaluation.
These are the projects that won the awards. The first, second, and third projects were the ones that won.
It was from the forest and won the first prize.
He had very detailed information about the project, and the project was ready to begin.
This means besides the administrative aspect, of course, many administrative aspects are needed.
I went into many very detailed specifics, distributed in a brochure for visitors as well, meaning it was ready for her project.
This is definitely the pictures that we are currently seeing.
This is a group, yes, this is a group, also many projects that I participated in.
Perhaps they feel this way, they have, it's not just that they are watching movies or cartoons.
No, she actually got engaged, which might come true in part, and was adopted by institutions.
For example, we give the project names. What are these projects?
This extra, how can it be utilized at home? How is it disposed of? Collected and returned?
Two hundred forty-seven students.
Yesterday, Qatar University celebrated the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation.
And a large number of parents and faculty members.
And the university celebrates today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
Of course, we thank colleague Salman Al-Mujadded, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a dear guest with us today.
From a family, a series of classifications, the artist Abdel Hamid Al-Sharsani.
And who confirmed his attendance with many works, including the series "Hearts for Rent."
And they struggled to prove themselves on the artistic scene.
Especially since the art field does not know compliments.
which means
Welcome to you and good morning. I would like to greet the viewers.
On the contrary, the program is great with the cast, honestly.
We will see something very simple from one of your works, and we will start a dialogue with you.
You're making a fool of me.
Take the fake bisht and bring the original one.
Go and get it.
The bisht is available.
What is this bisht? Return it. How do I return it?
I will not provide a translation for
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
In the Higher Committee of the Conference.
I do not agree with you.
I don't mind.
Here is a quick clip, a simple scene from the series "Tasaneef", which we will see the second part of.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part.
Can you tell us a little about your roles, which is the series "Tasaneef"? Each episode has a different topic.
What is your participation that you want to tell us about?
Of course, after what...
That era has passed by me many times.
Murat is also known for its mountain.
The long-sought-for Amethyst, which poets have celebrated throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
And it indicates the antiquity of its past.
which is away from the capital Riyadh one hundred and seventy kilometers north
It was said that his lineage was attributed to Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It was distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
Poets sang of it, were fascinated by it, and its fame became linked to its known reddish-brown mountain.
It is said: Ghadir Kumayt.
Of course, the city of Murat is an ancient city.
And it preceded the advent of Islam.
There were old things whose history was unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
The ones that we are currently missing.
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God be pleased with him, ordered, upon his passage to fight the Apostasy Wars, that this well be dug.
And it has remained until this day.
The saying goes, "Guarantee me Akmit, and I will guarantee you Murat."
If you see Kamit, you will see times.
Of course, among the other effects is also Ghadeer Kumayt.
The one who, from Manhal, has provided the sweet water for years.
What used to be enough for the city for an entire year.
From the beginning of the rainfall until the next rainy season.
And also, this monument is still in use, and its date of construction is unknown.
Also, there is the bride and there is
Jabal Kumayt is one of the landmarks of the city of Murat.
And many proverbs, poems, and odes have been said about this mountain.
where people come to him from all regions of the kingdom
One of its most prominent features is Al-Wulidi Well.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: This is because he stayed in Marat during the days of the Ridda Wars, and he was heading towards al-Yamama.
So he camped there and ordered his men to dig this well.
Which still has water that is sought for irrigation even now, and from which they perform ablutions.
Yakut al-Hamawi mentioned in the Dictionary of Countries that Khalid passed by Marat.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original condition.
It contains many sections that highlight the architectural character of the region and what it is famous for in terms of heritage and antiquities.
The one about whom the poet said: "And when we arrived at the water, the water of Mijannah..."
Ghadir Kmeit, not Ghadir Al Najeel.
Mr. Ayman, there is also, mashallah, a kind of cooperation between the family, the father, the mother, with this center, with the child as well.
And I expect there are different ways that he can be with you firsthand.
For managing the training process in general.
It means from the moment the trainee, student, or child comes to us, whatever.
This file contains his complete personal information.
Even his grades, every month and a half, he has a period. Monthly, for example, we are.
This input appears to be
Every four lectures, there is a report.
Through a username and password, a user name and a password, the guardian can.
We give it to him so that he can log in to it.
Yes, it means assessing the extent of his level that he has reached from the beginning of his enrollment to this center until the current day.
Yes, we have several different models that we will be following up on.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, he will surely honor us in a short while.
We will see several different models. I wish we had more space.
But we brought a model of a child.
There will be, meaning, more than one test in front of you live on air.
We ask her questions in mathematics and different questions.
We will take a short break and continue with you. After that, we will see this smart little girl. Stay with us.
The artist's performance, the audience has become smart now.
Here's a translation of the text: "So, any work, he watches a couple of episodes, three, and if the work doesn't grab him, he just changes the channel."
He's not going to tire himself out, he has twenty thousand other series.
That's right, twenty thousand series, this is correct.
Concentrate on one thing at a time, meaning some people don't, one should focus on one work.
He can put the other business aside and take a look at it.
That's not how it is.
They say I only watch TV in Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome your presence with us as a generous and dear guest, Abdulaziz Al-Shershni.
Would you like me to address any words to the viewers, your audience, of course, those who love you? I am definitely one of your audience.
He addressed us with a word.
I tell them "every year and you are well".
Okay, here is the translation of the input text: "True, we don't go out much. We don't go out a lot. We don't represent a lot, by the way. Of course, I mentioned the reasons."
The future is better.
God willing, we wish you success in your work this year.
God willing, we will have a second meeting to talk about these plays.
It's all interconnected.
And because fashion shows have begun to receive attention from many people, and their lovers await the new models.
Welcome to you, our beloved viewers, through the morning of Doha, and we are with you live.
Today, we are definitely talking about the Skill Development Center and a group of male and female students, and our children who joined this center.
This center offers a wide range of different sciences.
Sure, their focus is on developing different abilities.
And also to fully utilize their minds, God willing.
Ms. Nisima, of course, and Mr. Ayman Khawajel, who is the Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
May God greet you.
And with us is the beautiful Omnia, Omnia, good morning.
Good morning.
How old are you, my love?
Ships Grand Ships
Mashallah, we wish you all the best of luck.
What services do you provide for our sons and daughters?
The clarification was made with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nasma, and it was specifically developed as a program that benefits children, our children.
And it is a program for minds for mental mathematics.
Through the fingers and through the abacus.
To reach some specific goals, we tried to clarify a small part of them.
I felt, Professor, I felt, Professor Ibrahim, that there is, there is a difference, indeed, the student, as soon as he enters, the first two days.
And after he completes months with you, perhaps three or four months.
If it were taught in public, private, or even independent schools.
Initially, the program is not scientific in certain ways.
After passing the first level of the program
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Which clarifies where the abilities that the child lost or needs to develop to reach them are."
And it has reached a certain limit, or what are the developments that have happened with the child?
So we are proceeding with a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not only are some methods or mechanisms being applied in a normal way.
No, in a scientific way, in an organized way.
Before the program started, and after taking this course or the levels he went through.
Professor Ibrahim is now present with us, as you can see, our viewers. Omnia is a student among the students who joined this center.
We wanted this thing to happen today on the air so that we can show you, our viewers, the importance of this matter.
I have no problem with you returning the bisht.
Here is a quick clip, a simple scene from the series "Tasaneef", which we will see the second part of.
But since we saw this clip from the series Tasanif Part One.
Can you tell us a little about your roles, which is the series "Tasaneef"? Each episode has a different topic.
The year, he focused on the fact that he was the one who went.
The best
She urged while she was giving opportunities.
16 episodes in the classifications of Taw.
Of course, a ring manager appears in it, an old man of a ring appears in it, a baker of a ring appears in it.
It means various dialects.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti from Qatar.
From Qatar, we have artists.
Many artists are not coming to my mind right now. Of course, we have female artists from Bahrain: Zahra Arafat, Ibtisam Abdullah.
We have.
Faisal Rashid and Muhammad Adel.
Of course, Tara.
It means if it weren't for Tara, the guys wouldn't have acted.
The work has decreased. We have become in Qatar. In the year, you have two works.
Qatar Television also produces dramatic works, as we can say.
Al Ghatr TV, she gives, executive producer.
Qatar TV, you didn't fall short, of course, but producing one work a year, while all actors in Qatar want to work.
This was the reason.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a translation for this input. The input contains URLs and potentially sensitive or private information, which I am not authorized to process or translate.
Even if someone has a vision, they say thank God.
Thank God for everything.
Okay, let's go back to your beginnings, then.
I would thank him a lot, of course.
Consult him on several things.
Of course, artist Abdulaziz Jassim, from the rule of humans to another day, to after the diaspora, to yes and no.
In his plays, we started working with him on a theater day when he produced his first product as an executive producer, Abdul Aziz Jassim, we worked with him as a theater and as a television
He is the one who adopted us, taught us, and made us who we are.
Of course, after they came to Professor غانم in worldly talks, he didn't fall short with us in Fayez Al Tawash 2000.
Because honestly, he gave us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two works per year.
So we have two works per year, so thank you, thank you Tara.
A killing feeling, of course, the same thing, produced by Tara Art Production.
The series director, Professor Mounir Al-Z...
We are back to you, our viewers, and today's topic is reflexology.
Massage by the palm of the hand.
This is the treatment that has actually been practiced since ancient times.
And we brought a guest with us.
The inspection procedure is as follows:
Swelling, his turn, the pain.
You feel inside the hand, you sometimes feel like sand, like shattered veins inside the hand.
Let go of your hand.
Of course, we have the brother, my friend, a little bit, his nerves are tense.
You feel pressure, stress, and a little bit of anxiety.
The left side.
Of course, we are now, dear viewers, I am examining the left part of his body.
So they're in the picture.
Any health problem will show up now. We have come to know the headache and the dizziness that afflicts him.
There is no pain here.
Pain means problem.
What is this problem exactly here?
What's here are the pockets, the ear.
The atmosphere of the sneeze. You have an operation in the nasal sinuses or a problem before.
MMS did an operation, but it was a long time ago.
What is a nasal polyp or something?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is from the nerves, the day I told him, there was nerve tension.
Ten years ago, I walked barefoot on the beach.
Okay, we know that when someone walks by the sea, I expect that it empties out, such as...
Any uneven terrain is not just the sea.
Negative energies that can affect the boards.
He was also perhaps surprised by you, that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, the most important people are the children.
The children, glory be to God, belong to the mother. Focus with me.
Tired from milk and the food that he uses.
Here is the translation of the input text: "قابلها طفلها واتحطها بيسكر الطفل توماتيك" **Translation:** "Her child met her and put her, the child gets drunk automatically."
Wash your hands.
Very slight pressure, glory to God.
After a few seconds, you notice the child enjoying themselves. First, they get hurt, and it hurts a little because of the pain here.
Then suddenly, praise be to God, you see the gases coming out.
What discoveries have you made, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But it's less than the other problems. Now it's joints, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
Secondly, regarding menstrual pain or period pain or menstrual pain in general.
Do you focus on rocks or stones, or is it just by pressing here that you give orders, glory be to God, to the lower back and menstrual problems, if there is pain in you.
Within seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
The pregnant woman.
It facilitates childbirth for her.
Either here or there, of course, or God knows best.
If they tell her that by God in the seventh month there is a chance for you to give birth or in the ninth month.
Only on sand.
It means walking on sand is no problem, but on rock, no.
It is preferable to break the fast with seven fresh dates, as they are the best.
And if you don't have fresh dates, dried dates will be enough, God willing.
As He said, may God protect us from the accursed Satan, and my discovery of this is from the Quran, of course.
It means God was not able to make this fresh date ripe; this comes to it, He was not able.
O Allah, to You is the praise, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word 'I'.
You bring rocks, you bring small balls.
The bed for childbirth, and she is in the - I forgot, for example, she came in the childbirth bed, holding the iron.
And you'll notice even in private hospitals, you come, an East Asian woman.
Now, God willing, this is actually a custom in East Asia.
My phone is with you, no need.
Only the mobile phone.
I cooperate with some, meaning each one. I advise every creature who hears me now.
Be keen on giving charity and be keen on caring for others. You were created to worship Allah, then...
To serve the people, that's the first thing. The second thing is that we are not, I am not a man of religion or a sheikh, I am a normal human being.
Contact Professor Abdul Aziz, I thank you for this good meeting. Thank you, of course, to our guest who is with us.
May God give you a thousand health. God willing, and good luck, God willing.
More detailed, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Department of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak to us.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's directly start with a look at these events.
The truth is the Healthy Steps program towards Qatar.
It means it is a program if it is one of the parts of the national strategy to address to combat obesity.
It means that four out of the ten countries in the world with the highest obesity rates are from the Gulf states.
So we started in the Supreme Council of Health a strategy of course in cooperation with of course the Ministry of Education and other parties in combating obesity
Fearing its spread more and more, Fal Fal will be released soon.
One of the programs to protect against obesity is healthy steps towards Qatar.
They work on this competition together, so it becomes an international competition.
Of course, the program is a six-week course.
Every week is different from the next week.
To raise awareness among students in the seventh and eighth grades about the importance of health at this age.
Because at the beginning of their life, they start to be aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about, about what? Your favorite fruit.
Second week: Walking
You have to walk, meaning of course, the more one walks, the more points one gets.
It is a map of Qatar, and the more one collects points, the more one's school takes steps forward, and one's class takes steps forward, meaning...
So there is a nice competition, I mean, among the students.
During the third week, he is drinking water. We don't want him to drink carbonated water.
We tell him to get used to drinking water. There's no need for too many carbonated drinks. Whenever you get thirsty, you take a carbonated drink. No, drink water.
Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport.
Some have games at school that he doesn't like.
So we are looking for a sport game that he likes.
In order to force him to, I mean, I mean, exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that they must pay attention to their son, to feed him a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy is an academy for boys and girls so that we can take
Of course, this is a sample of its success, God willing, we will increase the experiment in the coming years.
Of course, the students are happy. I don't know what they're feeling, but it says our activity is more.
We asked for more games. We enjoyed ourselves more with our colleagues.
Girls, they say their skin has improved, acne has lessened.
Correct, correct, exactly. It becomes aware.
Parents know about their children.
And their colleagues in the second rows, they say, "How are you?" meaning, and they learn from them, and their colleagues and brothers.
And thank God, it has started to spread that there are many schools eager to participate next year, of course, meaning.
God willing.
Of course, the official sponsor was Qtel in supporting this.
We had Aspire Zone, they presented sports competitions for students and awareness.
Eat, eat, eat, at the dining table, it means.
So, thank God, several parties, meaning including, meaning, these I mentioned, and there are others, perhaps I missed them.
But thank God, everyone participated with a part of their own.
Some of the brothers were doing competitions on Saturdays.
It had variation in it.
We tried to make several types and get the largest number of people involved.
He is the future generation, meaning...
Until we disseminate this experience or spread it to the largest extent, for example, in Qatar.
You are evaluating for the first time, so there are some things that you need to adjust.
After this, its spread, thank God, is now, and the satisfactory results.
God willing, we are publishing it because there are people now demanding, saying why didn't you include us?
Eat healthy food, and you will reach this thing. You have no problem.
Here's a translation of the provided text: "When we are at this age, when it starts from his young age, he will reach what he desires when he is twenty years old or twenty-five years old."
You mentioned a group of titles, and each week had a title.
If we go back, we will try in our segment today to be about the conclusion of the events.
And also, if we go back to reminding people, in our program, we had more than one hosting.
We keep repeating and coming back every week. What was this information that we wanted to convey to the students?
Okay, my sister, first of all, for example, during the first week, your favorite fruit.
Of course, fruits in general, a whole lesson about fruits, what are their benefits?
What is the benefit of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he himself starts to know what he likes in fruits, not all fruits are his enemies, meaning...
It means, so he might develop an allergy to one or two types, but why doesn't he eat the rest of them?
Second week, walking. People think that walking is only for young, lazy people. Why should they walk?
It means that when I grow up, I will walk.
On the contrary, you are walking because it calms the mind and the brain, meaning...
And it relieves human psychology, meaning walking provides mental clarity and improves, meaning...
You used to take them to go to the students.
No, all of them are required to walk, whether it's at school or at home.
And they score their points through grade schools.
Because they are few, not daily.
This was an event where people held a march, the girls' school held a march.
We want them to be creative, to have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition, and teachers coming up with new ideas, we don't want to give them ideas that they won't deviate from.
Each person had, you know, their skills in this point.
Of course, during the third week, I drink water. Of course, all the time we try to make them drink water so that they don't get thirsty and crave carbonated water.
Of course, the fourth week, your favorite sport.
So, if we are able to reach his favorite sport and support him in it.
He gets excited about sports.
Their love for sports is that they are playing it, they are playing sports without realizing it.
Since we talked before that we will talk about the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
Let me welcome our guest of the day, who has graced our studio.
Welcome to you.
May God greet you with us in this program.
And among these, this disease is perhaps unknown to many of us.
In the beginning, as the Egyptians say, "straight" we will get into the subject.
Is it a chronic disease?
It affects the nervous system in the human body.
Intermittent affects people between twenty to forty years old.
This illness also currently has no cure, and its cause is still unknown. This illness and its infection...
It affects the active segment of society, which is the youthful segment, usually.
Treatments used for cancer patients (may God keep evil and other diseases away from you).
This disease is an inflammation of the brain nerves and the spinal column nerves.
It is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body feels that there is a body close entering the body.
The neuron is a
The wire covering the electrical wire.
White blood cells, the first white blood cells, kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
This leads to the nerve signal not being transmitted, or being weak, or being abnormal.
It leads to paralysis, God forbid it for you.
Until now, with the development and progress of medicine, meaning Professor Abdul Aziz, until now we have not found a solution to this disease.
Okay, besides the solution, we want to know how it comes to us, meaning...
Also, one must have protection from this issue.
It means the direct underlying cause, meaning the nature of life, the nature of food, circulations of life.
And what is the exact direct reason that makes a person possibly get this disease?
Everything that currently exists is based on theories.
Even by virtue of marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans face.
Yes yes.
It means all these topics perhaps, I mean, raise some controversy within society.
Until now, we don't know the reasons for it.
Okay, the age group that can be affected by this disease, of course, is multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, the disease, after reaching forty years, begins to calm down with the person.
But until now, we have not found a solution for this disease.
Does this mean proof of the existence of many people, whether in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even let's say in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics say they have twenty-five thousand infected people.
And also Qatar, I mean.
I personally have been informed of three to four very well-diagnosed recent cases, just during the past week.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five infected individuals. This is what is recorded in the files.
And there are many people who, when diagnosed with this disease, go to treatments from other countries, for example.
Okay, Mr. Abdulaziz, I mean, are there some effects, I mean, for example, if a person is infected with this disease?
Is there some sign that gives to the family of this affected person or to him personally that I am affected by nerve stiffness?
And this virus seemed, for example, to be able to completely eliminate...
Let's be honest, it's not a virus.
Because it's a disease of the nerves. The nerves are controlling the whole body.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "However, to some extent, we tend to or give a specific reason for a specific place, that, by God, the nature of food, by God, the nature of..."
