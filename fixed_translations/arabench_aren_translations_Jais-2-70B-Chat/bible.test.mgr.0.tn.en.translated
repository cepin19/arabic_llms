Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child and stood him in the midst of them.
He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Someone who accepts a little boy, how is that? Because my name accepts me.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a great millstone of a رحى tied around his neck and to be thrown into the depths of the sea.
Oh, woe to the world because of the things that make people commit sins! These things are necessary to come, but woe to the person who brings the things that make people commit sins!
And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into eternal life with a cut-off foot or a crippled limb, than to enter into eternal fire with your whole body intact.
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into the life of the world to come with one eye, than to be cast into the hell of fire with two eyes." The Lost Lamb (Luke 15:3-7)
Beware, do not despise any of these children. I tell you: their guardian angels in heaven are always looking at the face of my Father in heaven.
# ‏18‏:11 Some ancient texts contain this verse: Behold, I, the Son of Man, have come to seek and save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes missing, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go look for the lost sheep? **Note:** This is a famous riddle, often attributed to Jesus in the Bible (Matthew 18:12-14). The translation aims for accuracy and clarity while preserving the essence of the original riddle.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "To tell you the truth, if he finds it, he will be happier with it than with the ninety-nine that were not lost."
«So then, it is the will of My Father who is in heaven that of these little ones only one be lost.» Forgiveness among brothers (Luke 17:3)
If your brother wrongs you, go and tell him about his mistake, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
If, however, he doesn't listen to you, take one or two other men with you, so that for every word that is spoken, there are two or three witnesses to it.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, have him regarded as an infidel or a libertine.
What I tell you is this: What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Let me say it again: If two of you agree on anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
That time Peter came and said to Jesus: "Lord, how many times shall my brother wrong me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said, "I tell you not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
That is why the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
As he was holding them accountable, they brought him someone who owed him countless amounts of money.
And as he couldn't pay, his master ordered him, his wife, his children, and all his possessions to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell on his knees and said, "Master, master, have patience with me and I will pay you for everything!"
And his master mocked him, left him, and forgave him the debt.
As for that servant, he himself went out and found another servant like him who owed him a little money. So he choked him and said, "Pay me the money you owe me!"
My man, the other servant fell on his knees and begged, saying, "Wait for me, I will pay you."
He didn't like it, so he left, and they put him in jail until he pays off the debt he owes.
The servants of the other master, seeing what had happened, were very worried and went and informed their master of everything that had occurred.
At that very moment, his master called him and said, "You wicked servant! I forgave you that entire debt because you begged me.
And you have no right to show mercy to your servant, just as I showed you mercy?"
Shedo became his guarantor and handed him over to the prison authorities until he paid off his entire debt.
Here too, my Father who is in heaven will do the same with each one of you, if he does not forgive his brother from his heart."
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea, crossing the Jordan River.
And many people followed him, and he looked at the one who was there.
And a group of Pharisees came to him and asked him to test him: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Answer them: "Haven't you read that the One who created them in the beginning created them male and female."
And He said, "This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh?"
Therefore, they are no longer two, but one flesh. That is why what God has joined together, let no one separate."
The Pharisees said to him, "Then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce to our wife and to send her away?"
Jesus said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts are hardened. But from the beginning, it was not so."
And I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman, commits adultery."
The students said to him: "If this is the state of a man with his wife, it is better for him if he does not marry."
As he told them, "Not everyone can accept this message, but only those whom God enables to receive it."
There are some people who cannot get married from the time they were born from their mother's womb. And there are some people to whom others have done something that made them unable to get married. And there are some people who do not want to get married because of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can do this, let them do it." Jesus blesses the little children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
And they brought children to Jesus, so that he might lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
As Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he put his hand on them and went from that place. The Rich Young Man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
And someone came to him and said, "Teacher, what good things must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask Me about the good things? For there is only one good. If you want to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments."
And he said to them, "Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the
# La 19:18 "Honor your father and your mother, and you must love your neighbor as yourself."
The boy said, "I do all these things. What else do I lack?"
Jesus said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor. And you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me!"
When the boy heard this, he went away sad because he owned many things.
And Jesus said to his disciples: "I tell you the truth, it will be easier for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!
And He said to them again: "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
If the students heard this, they would be very surprised and say, "Then who can be saved?"
And Jesus looked at them and said to them, "This is impossible for mortals, but for God all things are possible."
At that time, Peter answered and said, "Behold, we have forsaken all things and followed Thee. What shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you: when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the new heavens, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left homes, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, children, and lands for the sake of my name, will receive one hundred times more than they left and will inherit eternal life.
And many people at the beginning will become at the end, and the people who are at the end will become at the beginning."
Like the servants of the vineyard.
«The kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He made an arrangement with the maids to wear a silver trinket during the day, and he sent them to the vineyard.
And he went out with the nine, my brother, he saw other people standing in the market and unemployed.
And he said to them: "You too, go to the vineyard, and I will give you your right." And they left.
And he went out again around half past noon, and returned at three in the afternoon, doing the same thing.
He went out about five in the evening and found some other people sitting down, and he said to them, "Why are you sitting here doing nothing all day?"
They said to him, "No one has called us to work." He said to them, "You too, go and work in the vineyard."
As the evening came, the owner of the grapes said to the one who was busy with the workers: Call the workers and pay them, start with the last ones until you reach the first.
And the group that started working at five in the evening came, and each of them took a piece of silver.
And when the first ones came, they thought that they were going to get more than the others, but each one of them took a piece of silver.
And when they were paid, they got angry at the vineyard owner.
And they said: "These last two worked for only one hour, and you paid them the same as us who worked all day in the heat!"
As for the answer, one of them replied: "My friend, I assure you I have not wronged you. Did we not agree on a piece of silver?"
Take what's yours and leave. I wanted to give this other person the same way I give to you.
"Do I not have the right to dispose of my money as I wish? Or are you envious because I am generous?"
Jesus said, "The last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks a third time about his death and resurrection (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34).
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and said to them along the way:
Here we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
"And do not deliver me over to the Gentiles, so that they might mock me and flog me and, indeed, kill me; and after three days, I will rise." The request made by the mother of James and John (Mark 10:35-45).
And behold, a woman afflicted with internal bleeding came, and with her, a host; and they prostrated themselves before Him, and this woman approached Him and requested of Him a thing.
Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that my two sons will sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus answered them, "You do not know at all what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are able!"
He told them, "You are the ones who will drink from my cup, but I am not the one who decides who will sit at my right and at my left. But my Father is the one who has prepared a place for those people."
And when the other ten disciples heard that, they were indignant at the two brothers.
As for Jesus, he called them to come to him and said, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the people exercise authority over them, and those who have power dominate them.
But you, it is necessary that there should not be between you that thing. But the one who wants to be great among you, let him be your servant.
He who wants to be the lowest among you, let him be the servant of all people.
"Even I, the Son of Man, did not come to be served, but to serve and give my life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
And when Jesus and His disciples were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to cry out, saying, "Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
My brothers, the people cried out to them to be quiet. But they cried out even more: "Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood up and called out to them and said to them: "What do you want me to do for you?"
He said to them, "My friends, I want to see again!"
And Jesus was moved with compassion for them, and touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Jesus enters into Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem and reached the village of Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, at that time Jesus sent two disciples,
And he said to them, "Go to the village opposite you, and you will find a tied-up donkey and its foal. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone tells you anything, answer them: "The Lord has need of them." And He will send them back at the proper time.
This happened so that what the prophet said would be fulfilled.
"Say to the daughter of Zion: 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' "
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them.
And they brought the beast and the donkey, and they put their clothes on them, and Jesus rode on them.
And the majority of people spread their carpets in the street, and others cut tree branches and put them in the street.
Psalm 118:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39 and the people who went before him and those who followed kept shouting: "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up and asked, "Who is this?"
And the people said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus Expels the Sellers from the Temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out those who were selling and buying in the midst of the temple, all of them; and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the chairs of those who sold the doves,
And he said to them, "It is written in the Holy Book: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' and 'you have made it a den of thieves!'"
And the blind and lame came to the temple, and he healed them.
As for the Jewish high priests and scribes, they were angry when they saw the miracles that Jesus did, and how the little children were shouting in the temple: "Save us, Son of David!"
And they said to him, "Do you hear what they are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read this scripture: 'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"
And he left them and went out of the city to the house of Mary and Martha, and he stayed there that night. Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And when he was returning to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
And he saw a vine by the roadside. My brother, he didn't touch it, and he found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "You shall never bear fruit again for all your days!" And the vine dried up at that very moment.
The disciples, having observed what had taken place, wondered and said, "Why has this fig tree withered so quickly?"
Jesus answered them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt at all, you will not only do the miraculous sign that was done to the fig tree, but you will even say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea!' And what you said will come to pass."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Anything you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and you will be yours." The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
As Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, and if you tell Me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things:
Here is the English translation: "Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" They agreed with each other, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
Here's the English translation: "On the other hand, if we say: 'It's from people,' we're afraid of people because they're all sure that John is a prophet."
Therefore, Jesus answered them, "I do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the two sons.
What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first son and said to him, "My son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"My son, go work in the vineyard," the father said to his son. The son replied, "I will not go." But later he changed his mind and went.
And he walked up to his other son and told him the very same thing he had told his first son. And the son replied: "I am going, sir!" But he did not go.
"Who is the most blessed: the brother who does what his father wants him to do?" The elders said to him, "The first one." Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth: tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the Kingdom of God ahead of you."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "John came to you in the way of a righteous man, and you did not believe in him. But those who collect taxes and the corrupt women believed in him. And even when you saw that thing, you did not repent or believe in him." Like the tenants of the vineyard (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19).
Listen to another parable: There was a man who planted a vineyard, and he put a wall around it and built a tower within it, and he leased it to vinedressers and went to another country.
As the time for the grape harvest approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to demand the produce.
And they grabbed the five servants of his and beat one of them, killing another, and stoning another with stones.
And the grape's servant sent the once again more numerous servants he had sent the first time, but they did the same thing to them.
He sent them his son and said, "Now my children can."
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "However, when the five workers saw the boy, they said to each other: 'This is the one who will inherit! Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance!'"
They grabbed him, took him outside the grape arbor, and killed him.
"So, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do with those five laborers?"
The elders of the Jews said to him, "He will thus destroy the wicked and give the vineyard to other vine dressers who will give him the fruit of the vineyard at the proper time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? This is the work of the Lord; it is amazing in our eyes."
Therefore, I tell you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit." (Note: The original text contains some grammatical and stylistic nuances that are difficult to perfectly render in English while maintaining the original meaning and tone. The translation provided aims to capture the essential message of the text.)
# ‏21:44 There are ancient texts containing this verse: "Behold, I, the Son of Man, have come to seek and to save the lost."
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these parables, they understood that he was speaking about them.
As they were trying to arrest him, they feared the people, because they considered him a prophet.
Like the banquet of the king (Luke 14:15-24).
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent the servants to call those summoned for the wedding night festivities, but they did not come.
And he sent other servants again and said, "Tell the invitees: 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner, and I have killed the fattened oxen and the fattened cattle; and all is prepared. Come to the wedding feast!'"
As for them, they didn't make any plans for the evening and each went their own way. One went to his field, and another went to his shop.
And the others seized his servants, humiliated them, and killed them.
The king was deceived and sent his soldiers, and they killed those criminals and burned their city.
And he said to his servants, "The feast is prepared, but the guests are not worthy."
So, go out into the streets and summon as many people as you can for the wedding celebration.
And those servants went out to the road and brought all the good and bad people, until the wedding house was filled with guests.
When the king came to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing a robe. So he said to him:
How did you get in here without wearing the wedding outfit?" The man remained silent.
At that time, the king said to the servant, "Tie him up by his hands and feet, and throw him outside into the darkness. And tomorrow there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many years to come."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
At that time, the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Jesus in His words.
And they sent to him the disciples of John, along with a group from the party of Herod, and they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are a true teacher, and you teach the way of God in truth, and you care about no one, because you do not regard the person of anyone."
Tell us: What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?»
But Jesus perceived their malice, and said to them, "You hypocrites! Why do you test me?"
"Show me the money for the taxes!" He was brought a silver coin.
Jesus said to them, "Whose image is this and whose title is written on it?"
They said, "Caesar's things!" But he told them, "Therefore, give back Caesar's things to Caesar, and God's things to God!"
And they wondered, when they heard that speech, and they left him and went away. Resurrection of the Dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
During that day, the Sadducees, who believed that there was no resurrection after death, came to Jesus and asked him a question.
And they said, "Rabbi, Moses said, 'If a man dies and does not have children, then his brother shall marry his wife and provide offspring for his brother.' "
And now there were seven brothers among us, and the elder brother got married and died without having children, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even seventh brother.
And after everyone left, the woman died.
Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection, that woman will be the wife of which one among them, because she married all of them."
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you have not understood the Scriptures or the power of God.
On the Day of Resurrection, they will neither marry nor will anyone marry them. However, they will be like the angels in heaven.
It is as if you are facing the Day of Resurrection of the dead. Didn't you study what God told you:
Behold, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? What! Are there not gods of the living, and gods of the dead?
And when the people heard that speech, they were amazed at his teaching. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28).
When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came to him in a body.
And one of them, who was a scholar of Islamic law, asked him a question to test him:
Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
Jesus answered: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"The second commandment is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"** (The original Arabic text references biblical commandments from Exodus 20:13 and Leviticus 19:18, which are essentially the same as the English translation provided.)
"The entire Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." Christ and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
Here's the English translation: "What do you think about the Messiah? Who is he the son of?" They told him, "The son of David!"
He said to them: "How then does David in spirit call him 'Lord,' when he says:
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."
If David calls him "Lord," then how much more so is his Son?"
And no one could answer him with a word. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any question.
Jesus warns against the book of the Jews and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And afterward, Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
The book of the Jews and the Pharisees who are sitting on the seat of Moses,
Therefore, do and keep all things whatsoever they command you. But do not do according to their works, for they say and do not.
They impose a heavy burden on people's shoulders, but they themselves would not touch it with their finger.
They do all sorts of things so that people can see them. They grow their beards long and make their clothes shabby on purpose.
And they love to sit in the first seats in the evening gatherings and the first chairs in the assemblies.
And they love to greet people in the markets, calling out to them: "O teachers!"
And you yourselves should not let anyone call you "Teacher," because you have only one teacher and you are all brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
And do not let anyone call you 'master,' because you have only one master, Christ.
Let your elder/leader serve you.
He who leaves his spirit descends, and he who humbles himself is elevated.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You do not enter, nor do you allow those who would enter to do so.
Here are some old texts that contain this verse: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel across sea and land to convert one person to your religion; and when you have succeeded, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you yourselves. "You are like unmarked graves which men walk over without knowing it." And He said to them, "Make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth, so that it may become a place of shelter for you in the time of trial. For in this way, will those who are in authority come to you, for they make the practice of taking bribes the basis of their rule."
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win one convert to your religion; and if he is won over, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are!
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'
Here is the English translation of the provided text: **"Isn't it more valuable, you ignorant and blind ones, the gold or the temple that made the gold sacred?"**
And you say, "Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing; but whoever swears by the offering on the altar, he is bound by his oath."
Here is the English translation of the provided text: Anna is the one who has the most value, you blind men? Is it the sacrifice or the altar that makes the sacrifice holy?
So, whoever swears by the altar, he has sworn by it and by everything that is on it!
Whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
He who swears by the sky also swears by the throne and by God who sits upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You give a tenth of mint, dill and cumin, but have neglected the more important matters of the law: justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have done these things without neglecting the others.
You who lead people, you blind men! You strain the water from the mosquito and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You wash the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You hypocrite, you blind man! First clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside of them may also be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! How you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and all uncleanliness.
And you also, outwardly you appear righteous to people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
O ye Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Ye build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the shrines of the righteous saints,
And you say, "If only we had been present among our ancestors, then we would not have shared in the shedding of the prophets' blood."
Here, bear witness against yourselves, you who are sons of those who killed the prophets.
So you maintain the balance of your ancestors.
You vipers, how will you escape the sentence of the torment of hell?
This is why I send you prophets and wise people and scribes. Among them, some will you kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city,
"Behold, I am against you and will draw forth your heart and blood from your body; and I will bring your wickedness out of you and put it away from you. Then will
"Take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and you shall be beaten in
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the messengers sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you would not allow it."
May your home remain a ruin for you.
Here's the English translation: "I tell you: you will not see me again until the time comes when you say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
Jesus prophesies about the destruction of the temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and showed him the temple's buildings.
My brother, he told them, "Look at this entire temple complex! I tell you the truth: not a single stone will be left on top of another; it will all come crashing down." The Disaster and Persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us when these things will be, and what is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Be careful, and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah!' and they will lead many astray.
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be afraid. For this must happen, but the end is not yet.
A nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in many places.
This whole thing is just the beginning of the labor pain.
And at that time, they will take you away for punishment and kill you. And all the peoples will hate you because of my name.
And at that time, many people will stop believing, they will no longer be believers, and they will betray each other and hate each other.
Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
And the love of the majority of people will grow cold, because of the increase of wickedness.
The one who proves it to the end is the one who will pay.

And let the one on the roof not come down to the ground in order to take the things in his house.
And let whoever is in the secondary school not come back to take his coat.
And woe to the pregnant women and those who nurse during those specific days.
Ask my Lord that you escape on a non-winter day, not Saturday.
Because at that time there will be great distress, such as has not been since the beginning of the world.
And if God had not been merciful in those days, then no human would have survived. However, He was merciful towards them because of the people He had chosen.
And at that time, if someone says to you, 'Here is the Messiah,' or 'There he is,' do not believe it!
Many false prophets and Christs will appear and produce great signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Hani, I warned you before.
So, if they tell you, "Here is the Messiah in the wilderness!" don't go out; and if they tell you, "Here he is in the inner rooms!" don't believe it!
Here's the translation: "As lightning flashes from the east and shines to the far west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be."

But now, at that very moment, no one knew them, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but only the Father knew them.
Just as it happened in the days of Noah, thus it will be when the Son of Man comes.
It was just like how people were in those days before the floods - they ate and drank and celebrated weddings, until Noah entered the ark.
And they were not mindful of anything until the floods came and swept them all away. This is how it will be when I, the Son of Man, come:

Two women are sitting on the millstone, grinding the wheat. One gets up, and the other stays.
Wake up, you do not know about the day when your Lord will come.
As I know this thing, if the homeowner knew when the thieves were going to raid his home, then he would have stayed up and not let his house get stolen.

Believe me: they are going to eat up all his possessions.
But if this servant turned out to be evil and said to himself: "My master will return late."
And he began to hit the other servants and eat and drink with the drunks,
He will return on a day he does not expect, at an hour he does not know.
So that they may cut them to pieces and place them in the place that the hypocrites are heading to. Where will the crying and the passing of the years be.»
Like young girls.
«Then the Kingdom of Heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were ignorant, and five knew how to behave.
When the ignorant ones took up their lanterns, they did not take oil with them.
Those who knew how to handle themselves brought their oil lamps, with their snuffers.
Like a slow-motion groom, they were all overcome with sleep and lay down.
Around midnight, they heard a shout: "The groom is here! Come out to meet him!"
My translation is: Dude, all the chicks got up and lit their lighters.
And the ignorant said to those who knew how to manage: "Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out."
Those who knew how to behave answered: "It is possible that it will not be enough for us and for you. Go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
And while they were on their way to buy things, the groom arrived. The guests entered the house where the wedding was to be held, and the door was closed.
And then the other young girls came too and said to the groom: "Oh sir, oh sir, open the door for us!"

Therefore, prepare yourselves, because you do not know either the day or the hour.» Like the sacks of money (Luke 19:11-27)
«The kingdom of heaven is like a man who wanted to travel, so he called his servants and gave them his money.»
He gave each of them according to their ability. He gave one person five bags of gold, another person two bags of gold, and another person just one bag, and then he left.
The one who took the five purses walked quickly and traded them, and he made a profit of five more purses.
He who took two purses also, won two more purses.
The one who took only one bag, went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.
And after a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "And the one who had taken the five purses came back, bringing five more purses, and said, 'Sir, you gave me five purses, and I have gained five more purses.' "
Lord said to him: "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a little, I will now put you in charge of much: enter into the joy of your Lord."
A man who had received two purses came again and said, "Sir, you gave me two purses, and I have gained two more purses."
Lord Seidou said, "Well done, you good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little, I will now put you in charge of much: enter into the joy of your Lord."
And he who took only one bag also came and said, "Sir, I have known that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered.
My brother, I was afraid, so I went and hid your purse in the ground, and here is your money."
As for the one who was called, he answered, "You wicked servant, you evil one, you wasteful one! Did you not know that I reap what I do not sow and gather what I do not reap?"
You should have put my money in the bank, and then I would have come back to take it with interest.
And he said to his servants, "Take the purse from him and give it to the one who has the ten purses."
Here is the English translation: He who has, will be given more and will have in abundance. But he who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.

And I will put the sheep on my right, but I will put the goats on my left.
And then I will say to the king who is on my right: "Come, you who were blessed by my father, inherit the kingdom that was prepared for you since the creation of the world."
Because I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in;
You were naked and you clothed me; you were sick and you visited me; you were in prison and you came to me."
At that time, the righteous will answer me: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink?"
And when did we see you as a stranger and take you in? Or as naked and clothed you?
And when have we seen you sick or tied up, that we would visit you?"
And when the king answered them, he said, "I tell you the truth: in every instance you did this to one of the least of these, you did it to me!"
And then I say to the one on my left, "Give me room, you cursed one, go to the fire prepared for the devil and his angels forever."
I was hungry and you didn't feed me, I was thirsty and you didn't give me drink,
And I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked and you did not clothe me; sick and in prison and you did not visit me."
And they too will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not help you?"
And I will answer them: "I tell you the truth, whenever you did not do that thing with one of my little brothers here, you did not do it with me."

The Jews are trying to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53).
When Jesus had finished saying all this, he said to his disciples:
You know that the Passover will come in two days, and the Son of Man will be delivered to be crucified.
And at that time, the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled at the house of Caiaphas, who was the highest of the chief priests.
And they consulted with one another to devise a plan to seize Jesus and kill him.
As they said, "We will not seek him during the festival, so that it does not become a commotion in the midst of the people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
Now it happened that when Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the Leper,
A woman came, and in her hand was a bottle of very expensive perfume. She poured it over his head while he was eating.
When the students saw it, they were upset and said, "Why is there such waste?"
This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money, and given to the poor!»
As for Jesus, he knew about this and said to them, "Why are you distressing the woman? For she has done a good thing for me.
The poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
And if she poured perfume on my body, she would be preparing me for burial.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Truly I tell you, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her." Betrayal of Judas (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
At that time, one of the twelve disciples, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
# Jer 21:32; Zec 11:12 And he said to them, "What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And it was at that time that he began to wait for an opportunity to betray him. The Passover dinner with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
And now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He told them, "There is a man in the city; go to him and say, 'The Teacher says: My time has come, to celebrate the Passover at your home with my disciples.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his twelve disciples.
And when they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
And they were very sad, and they began to say to him, one by one: "Could it be I, Lord?"
Answer them: "The one who dips his hand into the bowl with me is the one who will betray me."
"I am the Son of Man, and I must die as it is written about me in the Scriptures. And woe to the man by whom my betrayal comes! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
They asked Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him, "Master, is it I?" Jesus answered him, "You have said it." The Lord's Supper (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And when they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke, and gave to His disciples and said: "Take, eat, this is My body."
Here is a glass, and a basin. He gave them to them and said, "Drink from it all of you."
This is my blood, the covenant blood that was shed for many people, so that their sins might be forgiven.
I tell you: I will no longer drink from this grape juice, until the day comes when I drink it with you anew in my father's kingdom."
And when they sang, they went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus tells Peter that he will deny him (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38).
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away and desert me this very night. It is written in the prophets, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' "
"Therefore, after we rise from death, I will precede you to Galilee."
My brother, Peter said: "Even if they all leave you, I will never leave you."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said, "I will not deny you, even if I have to die with you." And all the disciples spoke of this. Jesus Prays in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)
And after that, Jesus and His disciples went to a place called Gethsemani, and He said to them: "Sit here, while I go yonder and pray."
And with him were Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and he began to feel in his soul sad and troubled.
At that time, he told them, "I am deeply sorrowful, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch."
And He was withdrawn from them for a little while. And He knelt down and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Nevertheless, not My will, but Yours, be done."
And he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me even one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit wants to remain alert, but the body is weak."
And again he prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me, unless I drink it, Your will be done, not mine."
And he returned once more and found them sleeping, because they could not lift their heads from sleep.
He left them again, and after that, he prayed for the third time, and he repeated the same words himself.
And behold, an angel of the Lord came up to him, and said to him, "Rise and shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you."

And while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Vali Hanu gave them a sign, saying: "The one I will kiss, that is him. Grab him!"
As he walked along, he came to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Teacher!" And he kissed him.
Jesus said, "My friend, do the very thing for which you came." At that moment, they came and laid their hands on Jesus, and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword."
My brother, are you under the impression that I am unable to ask my father for help, especially when he has already sent me more than twelve armies of angels?
Here's the English translation: **"So how are the holy books that say this must happen to be fulfilled?"**
And Jesus said to the people: "My brothers, you have made me a criminal. You come to me with swords and clubs! Every day I used to sit and teach in the temple, and you did not arrest me."
As for this whole thing happening, it is to fulfill what was spoken by the prophets.» At that time, the disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Jewish council (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24)
They took Jesus and brought him to Caiaphas, who was the highest ranking chief priest. Where the Jewish elders and scribes gathered.
Peter was following him from a distance until he reached the courtyard of the house of the high priest. He entered and sat with the guards to see what was going to happen.
And the chief priests, and I in the council of all the Jews, were seeking for false witnesses against Jesus to put him to death,
But they couldn't find a way, even though many people offered to testify falsely. And then they presented two witnesses.
And they said: "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.'"
The highest ranking chief priest stood up and said: "Brother, don't you have anything to respond with? It's as if you're not even listening to how these men are testifying against you?"
Jesus, however, remained silent. The highest-ranking chief priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said to them, "You are right in saying that I am. But I tell you this: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God's power and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
The top one among the chief priests, Dabasu, said, "He has blasphemed! Do we still need witnesses? You have just heard him blaspheme."
"What do you think we should do with him?" they answered: "He must die!"
And they spat on him and slapped him, and there were some complaints from those who hit him.
And they said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is it that struck you?" Peter Denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
And at that very time, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maid came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean!"
He then denied everything in front of everyone, saying: "I don't understand what you mean."
And when he went out to the outer door, another maid saw him and said to those who were present there, "This man was with Jesus who is from Nazareth!"
And Peter denied again, swearing and saying, "I don't know this man!"
Some time later, those present said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for you have the way of speaking characteristic of them!"
At that time, he began to swear and fidget: "I don't know this man." And as soon as he said it, the cock crowed.
And Peter remembered Jesus' word to him: "Before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
And in the morning, the chief priests and the elders of all the people, having agreed together against Jesus, took him and killed him.
And they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor. The death of Judas (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, the one who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he regretted it and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
And He said to them, "I have committed a great sin, shedding the blood of an innocent person." They said to Him, "What does that have to do with us? You must deal with the consequences yourself."
And he threw the silver into the temple and went out, and he hanged himself.
The high priests seized the silver and said, "It is not right to put this money into the treasury of the Temple, since it is blood money."
So, they came to an understanding and bought the plot of land belonging to the potter, so they could turn it into a cemetery to bury the foreigners in.
That's why the well is called the "blood well" to this day.
And thus it was done, as the prophet Jeremiah had said: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that they valued, whom the children of Israel had valued."
And they gave them money to buy the Potter's Field as a place for strangers. Just as my heavenly Father commanded me.» Pilate questioned Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered him, "You have said it."
When the high priests and elders accused him, he did not answer a thing.
And afterwards, Pilate said to him, "Aren't you listening to how they are testifying against you with many things?"
As for him, they did not answer him regarding any of them, until the governor remained very surprised. The Judgment of Jesus to Death (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And on every feast, the governor used to leave for the people one of the Marabouts whom they loved.
At that time, there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
And when they gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?"
Because he knew that they handed him over to him out of jealousy.
Added to this was the time when Pilate was sitting in court, his wife sent him a message saying, "Be careful not to do anything to that righteous man, I have become very disturbed about him tonight in a dream."
The high priests and elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be crucified.
The governor said to them a second time, "Whom of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
He said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they only shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"
Therefore, when Pilate realized that he had achieved nothing, and on the contrary there was an uproar, he took water and washed his hands in front of the people and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood! Do with him as you please."
And all the people answered and said: "Our blood and the blood of our children is upon us!"
And Pilate will offer to the people Barabbas, and Jesus to be scourged, to be crucified; and the soldiers mocking Jesus (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3).
And then they took Jesus, the soldiers, to the palace of the governor, and gathered all the band of soldiers before him,
And we tried, he wore it and they wore a red suit.
And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a reed in his hand, and they knelt down before him, mocking him and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they spat on him, and pulled out a reed and struck him on the head with it.
And after they mocked him, they tried on the red garment. They dressed him in his clothes, carried him, and made him stand firm. Jesus on the cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
And when they were going out of the city, a man from Cyrene named Simon, was forced to carry the cross of Jesus.
And when they arrived at a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull"
He was given a mixture of alcohol with something called myrrh for him to drink, but when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
"When they crucified Him, they cast lots for His garments, dividing them up."
And they sat down and started keeping an eye on him, the one who went there.
And they placed the accusation against him above his head on a plaque that read: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
And they crucified with him two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
Psalm 22:7-8; Psalm 109:25 And all who pass by the road mock him, wagging their heads and saying:
" 'You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God.' "
And the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews and the elders were also mocking him, saying:
"He who saved others, cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him."
Mao trusted in God and said: "I am the Son of God." Let God save him if he is pleased with him."
And the criminal who was crucified with him also reviled him with words. Death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And with half a day, darkness fell upon the entire world until three in the afternoon.
And with the three, Jesus cried out with a loud voice: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" which means "My God! My God! Why have you left me?"
And some of the bystanders who heard him said, "This man is calling for Elijah!"
And one of them ran and took a sponge, soaked it in the vinegar, put it on a reed, and extended it to him to drink.
The others said, "Wait, let's see if Elijah will come and save him!"
And Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split.
And the tombs were opened, and many saints who had died were raised.
And they came out of the tombs after Jesus rose, and they went to the holy city and appeared to many people.
When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"
And there were many women watching from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee and served him.
And among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial of Jesus (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42)
In the evening, a wealthy man named Joseph, from the region of Ramath, also came. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked him for the body of Jesus. Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
And Joseph took Jesus's body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
And they buried him in a new grave that he had dug for his soul in the rock, and he placed a large stone at the door of the grave and walked away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
And from the morning, which is after the day on which they prepare, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
And they said to him, "Remember, Lord, how that deceiver said while he was alive, 'After three days I will rise.' "
This is why he ordered them to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples would not go and steal him and tell the people: "He has risen from the dead," and deceive people even more than before!»
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you wish."
So, they went and put candles on the stone and soldiers to guard the grave.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And after the Sabbath was past, and as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
My brother, a huge earthquake happened, there is an angel from God who descended from the sky and came, then he lifted the stone and sat on it.
And I saw lightning, and its trail was white like snow.
And the guards became terrified with fear of him, and they became like the dead.
And the angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He's not here, he got up as he said. Come and see the spot where he was lying.
And go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has been raised from the dead, and he will go before you to Galilee; there you will see him." Truly, I say to you."
If they had gone straight from the grave, they would have arrived quickly, while feeling both scared and extremely happy. They ran towards the students.
And at the pass, Jesus appeared to them and said to them, "Peace." Then they came near and touched His feet and worshiped Him.
My brother, Jesus told them, "Don't be afraid! Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The thing the soldiers said.
When the women were going, some soldiers returned to the city and told the chief priests about all the things that had happened.
The chief priests and the elders met together; they consulted and gave a lot of money to the soldiers.
And they told the guards, "Tell everyone, 'His disciples came at night and stole him while we were sleeping.' "
And when the governor hears the news, we will appease him and get you out of the problem."
And the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been spread among the Jews until this day. Jesus Appears to His Disciples (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
And so, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain, just as Jesus had instructed them.
And Jesus's disciples worshipped him, but some of them doubted.
And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
And teach them to do everything I have commanded you, and I will be with you always, to the end of time.»
John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way
