The birth of Jesus Christ took place as follows: His mother Mary was engaged to a man named Joseph. But before they were married, she learned that she was pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.
But Youssef, her husband, was a good man. He didn't want to expose her. So, he decided to leave her quietly.
And as Joseph was contemplating this, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said to him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child who is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
And she will bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.»
This happened so that what the Lord said through the prophet would be fulfilled:
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel, which means 'God with us.'"
And when Joseph woke up from his sleep, he did everything the angel of the Lord had commanded him; so he took his wife into his house.
But he did not know her until after she had given birth to a son, whom he named "Jesus."
Sages from the East.
And when Jesus was born in the city of Bethlehem in the region of Judea during the time when King Herod was ruler, some wise men from the east came to the city of Jerusalem,
And they said, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this, and so were all the people of Jerusalem.
So Herod called together all the chief priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what is written by the prophet:
«You, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.»
Herod secretly summoned the wise men and met with them privately. He learned from them the exact time when the star appeared, based on their precise calculations.
Then he sent them to the city of Bethlehem and said, "Go and search for the child. And when you find him, inform me, so that I may also come and worship him."
So the wise men listened to the king, and then they went on their way. And there, in front of them, was the star they had seen in the east. It went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
They were overjoyed when they saw the star.
So they entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they knelt on the ground and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then an angel of the Lord appeared to them in a dream, warning them not to return to Herod. So they went back to their own country by another route. The Flight into Egypt
And after the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Then Joseph arose, took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt.
And he remained there until Herod's death. This happened so that what the Lord had said through the prophet would be fulfilled: "From Egypt I have called my son." #From … my son. 15:2 From the Book of Hosea 11:1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem
And when Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he became very angry and ordered that all the male children in the town of Bethlehem and the surrounding region, who were two years old and under, be killed, in accordance with the time that had been confirmed to him by the wise men.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremy, saying:
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of great weeping and lamentation. It is the voice of Rachel weeping for her children, and she refuses to be comforted because they are dead. Returning from Egypt.
After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, while he was in Egypt.
And he said to him, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child have died."
Then Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Herod Antipas had become king in the region of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after God warned him in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee,
And he lived in a town called Nazareth. This happened so that what the prophets had said would come true, that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2. Pertaining to the city of Nazareth. It is also a word that resembles the Hebrew word that means "branch" mentioned in Isaiah 11:1 referring to the promise of the coming of the Messiah from the lineage of David.
John the Baptist
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
He used to say, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
And this John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord; make straight paths for him.'"
John wore clothes made of camel hair, and around his waist he had a belt made of leather. He ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, all the people started coming from the city of Jerusalem and from all of Judea, and from the region around the Jordan River to hear him.
And he used to baptize them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
And when John saw that many Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to be baptized by him, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Produce fruit that proves your repentance.
And do not boast, saying, 'We are the children of Abraham.' I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
Here is the axe laid on the roots of the trees. And every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for the forgiveness of sins. But the one who comes after me is greater than I am. I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He will carry his fork in his hand and will clean his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the granary, but burning the chaff with unquenchable fire.» The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from the region of Galilee to the Jordan River, because he wanted John to baptize him.
But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need you to baptize me, so why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Permit this to be so now, because it is fitting that we fulfill all that God requires." Then John permitted him to be baptized.
Jesus was baptized in the water. And as he came up out of the water, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice came from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
The Temptation of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After Jesus had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
So, the tempter came to him. #thetempter. 3:4 That is, Satan. And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' "
Then the devil took him to the holy city, and he stood him on a high pinnacle of the temple.
And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command yourself to be made into bread. For it is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'' And by the word of God, who quickens all things, and by the word of the Gospel, which gives life to all things, I tell you, and I affirm in the presence of God, that bread, from which a double portion had been taken, and which had been blessed, and broken, and distributed, did, in the sight of all, become the Flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself the Bread of Life, and the fountain of immortality."
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' "
Then the devil took him to a high mountain and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
Then he said to him, "I will give you all these, if you will fall down and worship me."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him alone shall you serve.'"
Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.
But he did not remain in Nazareth; instead, he went and settled in the city of Capernaum, near the Sea of Galilee, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened to fulfill what God said through Isaiah the prophet:
The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, the way of the sea of Galilee, beyond the Jordan, the land of Galilee, where the foreign nations live.
The people who dwell in darkness have seen a great light; those who sit in the region and shadow of death have a light dawned on them.»
From that time on, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Jesus Chooses Some of His Disciples
And as Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter also, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus left there and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. He saw them in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their fishing nets, and He called them.
Leaving the boat and their father immediately, they followed him. Jesus teaches and heals.
Jesus was traveling throughout the region of Galilee, teaching the people in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. And he was healing all the diseases and afflictions of the people.
And the reports about him spread in all of Syria; and they brought to him all the sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and who were possessed by evil spirits, and who were epileptic and paralyzed; and Jesus healed them.
And great multitudes followed him, who came from Galilee, and from the cities of the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
The teachings of Jesus.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up into a mountain; and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. #سيرثون الأرض. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. Here it may mean a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness, #for righteousness. 6:5 Literally: "To the righteousness." Because God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for God will show them mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Congratulations to you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely accuse you of doing evil, because you are my disciples.
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward in heaven is great. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you also. Salt and Light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
And people do not light a lamp and put it under a basket! But they put it on a high shelf so that it may give light to all who are in the house.
Thus also, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the Law of Moses or the teaching of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter or stroke of the law will disappear, until everything written in it is fulfilled.
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Because I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Anger
"You know that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not kill. #You shall not kill. 21:5 from the Book of Exodus 20:13 and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:17. And whoever kills will be liable to judgment.' "
As for me, I say to you that whoever is angry with another person deserves to be put on trial; and whoever insults another person should stand before the judicial council. And whoever says to another person, 'You fool,' deserves to go to hell.
Therefore, if you are offering a gift on the altar, and there you remember that someone else has a claim against you,
Leave your offering there before the altar. Go and be reconciled to the other person first; then come back and offer your offering.
"سالم خصمك بسرعة، بينما تمشي معه في الطريق إلى المحكمة. وإلا فإنه سيسلمك إلى القاضي، والقاضي سيسلمك إلى السجان فيلقي بك إلى السجن."
I tell you the truth, you will not leave there until you have paid the last penny you owe. Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." #do not commit adultery. 27:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:14, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:18.
Here is the English translation: But I say to you: whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is better that you lose one of your members, than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better that you lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Divorce.
It was also said: "If a man divorces his wife, he shall give her a certificate of divorce." #If he divorces … that. 31:5 From the Book of Deuteronomy 24:1.
I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The Oath
"You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not make false oaths, but carry out the terms of the oaths you make to the Lord.' #do not break … the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19: 12, Numbers 30: 2, Deuteronomy 23: 21."
But I say to you: Do not swear at all.
Do not swear either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by earth, for it is his footstool, #his footstool. 35:5 Meaning under him and subject to him. Nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Don't swear by your head, for you cannot make even a single hair on it white or black.
If you want to say "yes," then say "yes." And if you want to say "no," then say "no." And anything beyond that comes from the evil one. #theevilone 37:5 #Satan #resistevil
"Have you not heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' #eye ... tooth. 38:5 From Exodus 21:24, and Leviticus 24:20."
As for me, I say: Do not resist evil. But if anyone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him also your left cheek.
If anyone wants to sue you to take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
If someone forces you to go one mile with him, go with him two miles.
And if anyone asks you for something, give it to him. And do not refuse to lend to someone who asks to borrow from you. Love everyone.
«You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' #Love… your enemy. 43:5 From Leviticus 19:18.**
But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
So you may be called children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you love only those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even the tax collectors do that.
And if you only greet your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Even idolaters do that, don't they?
Therefore, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
The Giving.
Beware of practicing your righteousness before men in order to be seen by them; otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it as if you were sounding a trumpet, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets, seeking the praise of men. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So that your gift may be given in secret. And your Father who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not babble unintelligently as the pagans do, for they imagine that they will be heard because of their many words.
Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask Him.
Therefore pray as follows: "Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name,
Let your kingdom come, and your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins, as we also have forgiven those who have sinned against us.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. #Evil. 13:6 The Devil (Iblis). For Yours is the dominion, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Fasting
And when you fast, do not look somber like the hypocrites, who try to show how pious they are by wearing a gloomy expression. Instead, they should hypocritically try to make their faces look sad, so that people can clearly see that they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have already received their full reward.
But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
So that people don't notice you are fasting. Your father, whom you don't see, sees that. Then your father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. God or money.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal."
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Because your heart will be where your treasure is.
The light of the body is the eye. When your eyes are good, your whole body will be filled with light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and #Riches. 24:6 Literally "mamona." An Aramaic word meaning "wealth," in its negative sense, as it represents here a god that people serve instead of God. The Kingdom of God First"
«That is why I tell you, do not worry about your life, that is, about what you will eat and drink. And do not worry about your body, that is, about what you will wear. Because life is more important than food, and the body is more important than clothing.
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap, nor do they gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more to Him than the birds?
Which of you can add a single hour to his life when he frets?
And why are you anxious about what you will wear? Consider how the lilies of the field grow. They do not toil nor do they spin.
But I tell you, no one has ever worn one like this, not even Solomon in all his splendor.
For if God so clothes the grass of the fields, which you see here today and in the morning is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
Therefore, do not be anxious and do not ask yourselves: 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
These are things that the people of the world strive for, and your heavenly Father knows that you need all of them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough worries of its own, and tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others.
Do not judge others, lest God judge you.
Because he will judge in the same way you judge others. And with the same measure you use to measure others, it will be measured against you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log in your own eye?
And how can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the splinter from your eye,' when there is a wooden beam in your own eye?
Hypocrite! First, take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.
«Do not give what is sacred to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine! For the swine will trample them under their feet, and the dogs will turn and tear you. Perseverance in seeking»
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who seeks finds, and whoever knocks, it will be opened to them.
Which of you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, does he give him a snake?
You, even though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. Is not the Father who is in heaven much more worthy to give good gifts to those who ask Him? The Golden Rule
Here is the translation of the provided text: **"In the same way you want people to treat you, treat them. This is the essence of Moses' law and the teaching of the prophets. The way of heaven and the way of hell."**
"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate that leads to destruction is wide, and the road is easy, and many enter through it.
The door that leads to life is very narrow, and the path to it is full of difficulties. Only a few find this path. Warning against false teachings.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. For people do not gather grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles!
Also, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore you will recognize false prophets by their fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day: 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did we not perform many miracles in your name?'
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you.' Away from me, you evil doers!' The clever man and the stupid man.
Everyone who listens to these teachings of mine and acts accordingly is like a wise person who built his house on the rock.
So the rain fell, and the floodwaters rose, and the wind blew and hit that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.
And everyone who listens to my words and does not act upon them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And so the rain fell, and the floodwaters rose, and the wind blew and struck that house, and it fell with a terrible crash!»
And when Jesus had finished these words, the people were astonished at his teaching.
Because He was teaching them with authority, and not like the teachers of the law.
Jesus Cleanses a Leper
Then Jesus went down from the region of the mountains, and large crowds followed him.
And a leper came to him and prostrated himself before him, saying, "Lord, you are able to make me clean, if you will."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said, "I want to. Be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, so that people may know you have been healed." The Faith of a Roman Officer
And Jesus entered the city of Capernaum, and a Roman officer came to him. #Roman officer. 5:8 Literally "a centurion." Repetitive in verses 8, 13.
He said, "Lord, my servant is very sick and is lying in bed at home. He can't move and is suffering greatly."
Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
The officer answered him, "Master, I am not worthy to have you enter my house. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
For I myself am a man under authority, having soldiers under my command. I say to this soldier, 'Go!' and he goes. And I say to another, 'Come!' and he comes. And I say to my servant, 'Do such and such!' and he does it.'
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found such great faith, even in Israel."
I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and they will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven.
As for those who should have inherited the kingdom, they will be cast out into the outer darkness. There people will weep and grind their teeth!»
"Then Jesus said to the officer, 'Go, and let it be as you have believed.' And the officer's servant was healed at that very moment. 'He carried our diseases'"
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, feverish and very ill.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
And that evening, the people brought to him many who were possessed by evil spirits. He cast out the spirits by command of his mouth, and he healed all the sick.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our illnesses and carried our diseases." Following Jesus.
Seeing many people around Him, Jesus told His disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
One of the teachers of the law came and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus Calms the Storm
Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a furious storm arose on the lake, so that the boat was being covered with the waves. But Jesus was sleeping.
And when they came to Him, they woke Him and said, "Lord, save us, we perish."
Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, O little faith?" And He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
They were astonished and said, "What kind of man is this, even the winds and the sea obey him?" Jesus Casts Out Demons from Two Men
Then Jesus arrived in the region of the Gadarenes, on the other side of the lake. Two men who came from the tombs, possessed by evil spirits, met him. The men were dangerous, so no one dared to travel on that road.
And the evil spirits cried out, "What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"
And there was a large herd of pigs feeding at a distance from them.
And the unclean spirits begged him, saying, "If You cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said, "Go." So the evil spirits came out of the men and went into the pigs. Then the entire herd of pigs rushed down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.
The herdsmen fled to the town and told the people what had happened to those possessed by evil spirits.
So all the people of the town went out to see Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
Jesus got into a boat to cross to the other side of the lake, and he arrived at his own town.
Some people brought a paralyzed man to Jesus, lying on his bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."
So some of the teachers of the law said, "This man is blaspheming! He is saying evil things against God."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said to them, "Why do you think evil thoughts in your hearts?
Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk?'
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.» And He said to the paralytic, "Rise, pick up your bed and go to your house!"
He got up and went to his house.
And when the people saw this, they were filled with awe, and they glorified God because he had given such authority to people. Matthew 8:27-29 follows Jesus.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collection booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" And he got up and followed him.
And as he was eating in the house of Matthew, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard that, he said, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are ill."
Go and understand what the book means when it says: "I desire mercy for the people, not animal sacrifices." #I want… animal sacrifices. 13:9 From the book of Hosea 6:6. "I did not come to call the righteous, but I came to call the sinners." A question about fasting.
Then the disciples of John approached him and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is still with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
"No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, because the new patch will shrink and tear the old fabric, making the tear even worse.
And people do not put new wine into old leather bags. If they do, the bags will be torn, the wine will spill out, and the leather bags will be ruined. So new wine is put into new leather bags, and both the wine and the bags are preserved." Jesus raises a dead girl // and heals a woman who had been bleeding.
And while Jesus was speaking, the president of the synagogue came to him, bowed before him, and said, "My daughter has just now died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with the synagogue leader, and his disciples followed him.
And there was a woman who had suffered from severe bleeding for twelve years. She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his robe.
She said to herself, "If I can but touch the hem of his garment, I shall be healed."
Jesus turned around, saw her, and said to her, "Cheer up, daughter, your faith has healed you." And the woman was completely healed at that moment.
And when Jesus arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, he saw those playing funeral tunes, and the people were in chaos.
He said, "Go out to the street. The child is not dead, but is sleeping." And they laughed at him.
And when the people put them out of the house, Jesus entered the chamber where the boy was, and took him by the hand, and raised him up.
And the news about Jesus spread throughout that entire region. Jesus heals two blind men // and casts out an evil spirit.
And after Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"
And when Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" And they answered him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, so be it done to you."
And the two blind men recovered their sight. Then Jesus sternly warned them and said, "Tell no one what has happened to you."
But they went and spread the news all over that region.
And as they were going, behold, some people brought to Jesus a man who was mute, because he had a demon.
So Jesus drove out the evil spirit, and the mute man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
But the Pharisees began to say, "He casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul." #Beelzebul. 34:9 One of the names of Satan. Chief of those spirits." The harvest is plentiful
Jesus was traveling throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. He was healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
And when Jesus saw the multitudes of people, he had compassion on them, because they were distressed and without a helper, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out harvesters into his harvest."
Jesus Sends His Disciples.
And Jesus called his twelve disciples, and he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all diseases and all afflictions.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John,
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon who was also called "the Zealot," #the_Zealot. 4:10 from a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, called the party of "the Zealots." And Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus.
Jesus sent these twelve out and gave them the following instructions: "Do not go to Gentile territory, and do not enter a Samaritan town.
Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And they proclaimed, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received power to do this freely, so freely give to others as well.
Do not carry in your belts any money in gold, silver, or copper.
Do not take a bag, an extra tunic, an extra pair of sandals, or a staff. For the worker is worthy of his food.
And whenever you enter any city or village, find a person worthy of receiving you, and stay with him until you leave the city.
And when you enter a house, greet its people.
If the people of the house are deserving, then your greeting will come upon them. And if they are not deserving, then your greeting will return to you.
If anyone does not welcome you into a house or a city, and does not listen to your message, then leave that house or that city, and shake off the dust that has clung to your feet.
I tell you the truth, in the day of judgment, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah will have a more tolerable fate than that city. Jesus warns of tribulations.
«Behold, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.»
Beware of people, for they will hand you over to be tried in their courts, and they will flog you in their synagogues.
And they will deliver you to governors and kings because you are my disciples. This will be your opportunity to testify about me to the Jews and to the Gentiles.
And when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say, because you will be given the appropriate words at that hour.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who will speak within you.
Brother will deliver brother to be killed, and father will deliver his son. And children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
And all people will hate you because of my name, but the one who perseveres to the end, that one will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. Truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man returns.
No student is greater than his teacher, and no servant is greater than his master.
Let the disciple be content to become like his teacher, and let the servant be content to become like his master. For if they call the head of the household 'Beelzebul,' #Beelzebul. 25:10 Of the names of Satan. Reference to Matt. 9:34. what will they call the rest of the members of the household? Fear of God, not of people.
Do not be afraid of them, for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be made known.
Therefore, whatever I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and whatever you hear whispered in your ears, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear the one who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
"Doesn't two sparrows sell for a penny? Yet, not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's permission."
Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
If you are not afraid, you are more valuable than many sparrows. Confessing Christ before people.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.
And whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my Father who is in heaven. Christ first.
Do not suppose that I have come to establish peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword!
You came: "So that a man will become divided against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
The enemies of a person are the members of his own household!
Because whoever loves his father and mother more than me is not worthy of being my disciple. And whoever loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of being my disciple.
Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever tries to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will save it.
He who welcomes you, welcomes me. And he who welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me.
Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. And whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive the reward of a righteous person.
`` And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of my little disciples, because he is my disciple, I tell you truly, he will certainly not lose his reward.''
John the Baptist and not Jesus.
And when Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and preach his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist.
And while John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all the things Christ was doing, so he sent a message with some of his disciples
And he asked him, "Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them and said, "Go and tell John what you hear and what you see:
Here are the blind seeing, the lame walking, the lepers being cleansed, the deaf hearing, the dead being raised, and the poor hearing the good news.
«And congratulations to those who do not hesitate to believe in me.»
As John's disciples left, Jesus began to speak to the people about John: "What did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
Why did you come out, then? To see a man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes live in the palaces of kings.
So why did you come out here? To see a prophet? Well, that's what I am. In fact, I tell you that you have seen someone who is even greater than a prophet!
This is the one about whom it is written: "Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you."
"I tell you the truth, no one has ever born who is greater than John the Baptist. However, the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
For from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been facing violent attacks, and the violent are trying to seize it by force.
Because the Law of Moses and all the Prophets bear witness until John.
If you want to accept what the prophets and the Law say, then John is Elijah, the one they spoke about when they said he would come. #Elijah ... his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews were expecting his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
«Let him who has ears, hear.»
"What can I compare this generation to? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their companions and saying:"
"We played music for you, but you did not dance. And we sang for you the songs of funerals, but you did not lament!"
John came, who did not eat as others ate and did not drink wine as others drank. And people said of him, "He has a bad spirit."
Then came the Son of Man, who ate and drank wine, just like the others. And the people said about him, "Look at this man! He's a glutton and a drunkard, and he's a friend of tax
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities where He had performed most of His miracles, because their inhabitants had not repented of their sins.
And He said, "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, and worn sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you that the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon will have an easier time than you on the day of judgment.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you that the inhabitants of Sodom will be more tolerable in the judgment than the people of Tyre and Sidon." Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to the simple, like children."
Yes, Father, because you rejoiced to do this.
"I have received all things from my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you #yoke. 29:11 The yoke is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol of the law. Learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For the yoke that I give them is easy, and the burden that I put on them is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath.
At that time, Jesus went to walk in the fields on a certain Sabbath day. And his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck ears of corn and to eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Behold, Your disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate from the loaves of bread offered to God, even though he and those with him were not permitted to eat that bread. Rather, this was permitted for the priests alone.»
Have you not also read in the Law of Moses how the priests in the temple on the Sabbath day do not break the Sabbath law? And yet for this action they are not judged guilty,
But I tell you that there is something greater than the temple here.
And if you knew what the book means when it says: "I desire mercy for the people, not animal sacrifices." #Iwant…animal sacrifices. 7:12 From the Book of Hosea 6:6. When you judged those innocent people.
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.» Healing on the Sabbath.
Then he left that place and went to their assembly.
And there was a man whose hand was withered. And the people asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal this man's hand on the Sabbath?" They asked him this, that they might accuse him.
He said to them, "Suppose one of you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath. Wouldn't you grab it and pull it out?"
And man is more important than the sheep. Therefore, doing good on the Sabbath is in accordance with the law."
Then Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored, becoming just as good as his other hand.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might kill Jesus. Jesus: God's chosen servant.
Jesus perceived their scheme, and left that place. A great multitude followed him, and he healed them all,
And he ordered them not to reveal who it is.
This happened so that what God said through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled:
Behold, my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.
He will not argue with anyone, nor will he shout, nor will he let anyone hear his voice in their streets.
It will not break even a bent reed, nor will it extinguish even a smoking wick. And it will continue until it makes justice triumph.
And all nations will place their hope in him.» The authority of Jesus.
Then they brought to Him a blind and mute man, because he was possessed by an evil spirit. And He healed him. So the mute spoke and saw.
And the people were amazed, and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This fellow is not casting out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." #Beelzebul. 24:12. One of the names of Satan. Also in Numbers 27. Chief of the evil spirits."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "The fate of every kingdom whose people are divided and fight against each other is ruin. And every city or house whose people are divided and fight against each other will not endure."
If Satan casts out demons and fights against himself, then how can his kingdom endure?
If I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? For they will judge you.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then it has become clear that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
How could anyone break into a strong man's house and steal his possessions, unless they first bound the strong man? Then they could plunder his house.
"Whoever is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather with me scatters."
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
In order to obtain good fruit, plant a good tree. But a bad tree will give you bad fruit. For a tree is known by its fruit.
You brood of vipers, how can you speak of good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks what the heart is filled with.
For the good person brings out what is good from his good treasure, and the evil person brings out what is evil from the evil stored up within him.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment, people will be held accountable for every careless word they speak.
And your words will determine your innocence or your guilt.» The Jewish leaders demand proof.
Then some of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees came to him and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
And he answered them, "This generation, which seeks for a sign, will not be given any sign except the sign of Jonah."
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The people of Nineveh will stand up on the day of judgment against this generation, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now, here is someone greater than Jonah.
"And the Queen of the South will rise up #QueenOfTheSouth. 42:12 Queen of Sheba. And she had traveled about two thousand kilometers to hear the wisdom of God from the mouth of King Solomon. See the book of 1 Kings 10:1-13. The day of judgment against this generation and she will judge it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now here before you is one greater than Solomon. The empty soul"
"When an unclean spirit goes out from a person, it passes through dry places seeking rest, and finding none,
Then he says, "I will return to my house from which I came." So he goes and finds the house empty, swept, and tidy.
"Then he goes and brings back with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there. And so the last state of that man is worse than the first. So it will be with this evil generation." Jesus' disciples are his family.
And while Jesus was speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, and sent unto him, calling him.
Someone said to Jesus, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside and they want to speak to you."
Jesus answered him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then he motioned with his hand to his disciples and said, "These are my mother and my brothers,
For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother."
Like seeds.
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat on the shore of the lake.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat and sat in it, while the people stood on the shore.
And he said many things to them in parables. And he said to them, "A sower went out to sow.
As he was sowing, some seed fell beside the path, and the birds came and ate it.
Some of the seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the plants grew quickly because the soil was shallow.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and because it had no roots, it withered.
Some seed fell among the thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good ground, and they bore fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
«He who has ears, let him hear.» Hearing and understanding.
And his disciples came to him and asked him, "Why do you speak to them using symbolic parables?"
Jesus answered them, "God has granted you the privilege of knowing the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but he has not granted it to them.
Because everyone who owns #who owns. 12:13 Perhaps it is meant "who owns understanding." will have more added to them, overflowing for them, while those who do not own will have what they have taken away from them.
Therefore I speak to them in parables, because while they see, they do not perceive; and while they hear, they do not understand.
And so the prophecy of Isaiah applies to them: "You will hear and hear, yet not understand; you will look and look, yet not perceive.
For the mind of this people has become dulled, and their ears are hard of hearing. They have shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, or hear with their ears, or understand with their hearts, and be converted to me, and I should heal them.'
As for you, congratulations to your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous ones have desired to see what you see, but they did not see it; and they desired to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it. The meaning of the parable of the seeds.
Listen then to the explanation of the parable of the sower:
When someone hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one #the-evil-one. 19:13 i.e. the devil. (also in number 38) comes and takes away the seed that was planted in his heart. This is the meaning of the seed that fell by the roadside.
«As for the one that fell on the rocky ground, it is like someone who hears the word and accepts it immediately with joy,»
But because he is rootless within himself, he holds on for only a short time. And when persecution and tribulation come because of the word he has accepted, he quickly loses his faith.
«As for the one that fell among the thorns, it is like someone who hears the word, but the worries of life and the temptations of wealth choke the word, so it does not bear fruit.»
«As for the one who sowed on good soil, he is the one who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, and in another sixtyfold, and in another thirtyfold.» The Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds
And he said to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seeds in his field.
But while the people were sleeping, the enemy of the man came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away.
And when the wheat grew and formed spikes, the weeds also grew.
His servants came to him and said, "Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, have these weeds come from?"
The man answered them, "My enemy did this." His servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and uproot it?"
The man answered, "No, because when you pull out the weeds, you might uproot the wheat along with them."
Let them grow together until the harvest, and then I will tell the reapers, 'Gather the weeds first, and bind them in bundles to burn. But gather the wheat into my barn.'' For example, mustard seed and yeast.
Then Jesus said to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
It is the smallest of seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants, becoming a great tree, so that the birds of the sky come to it and make nests in its branches.»
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened."
Jesus spoke all these things to them in parables. He did not speak to them without a parable.
This is what God said through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, and I will utter hidden things from the foundation of the world."
Then Jesus went away from the crowds and went into the house. His disciples approached him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said to them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the son of man,
And the field is the world, and the good seeds are those who have the kingdom. But the tares are the children of the wicked one.
And the enemy who sowed them is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
And just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will the end of the world be.
For the Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of offense and those who practice lawlessness,
Then they will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will cry out and grind their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their father's kingdom. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. The parable of the treasure and the pearl.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a person found it, they hid it again. Overjoyed, they went and sold everything they owned and bought that field.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
And when he found a pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a fishing net.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the lake, and it gathered fish of every kind."
And when the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and began to choose the good fish and put it in baskets, but the bad fish they threw out.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, when the angels will come and separate the evil ones from the righteous ones,
Then you throw the wicked into the burning oven. There people cry and gnash their teeth.»
And Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" And they answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out from his storeroom new things and old things." Jesus went to His hometown.
And when Jesus had finished telling these parables, he left that place.
And when he went to his own country, he began to teach them in their synagogue, and everyone was amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
Is he not the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary? Are not his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Aren't all his sisters living with us? So where did he get all this from?"
This was a hindrance preventing them from accepting it. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house!"
He did not do many miracles there, because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus.
At that time, Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "It is John the Baptist! He has risen from the dead, and that is why these miracles are happening through him!" The Death of John the Baptist
For Herod himself had arrested John and bound him and imprisoned him because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
This is why Herod wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before them and her guests, and she pleased Herod very much,
He even promised and swore that he would give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
But her mother had taught her what to ask, and she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
The king was saddened, but he ordered that her request be fulfilled because of his oath, and out of respect for his guests.
He sent someone to cut off John's head in prison.
Then he brought his head on a platter and gave it to her, and she gave it to her mother.
Then John's disciples came and took away his body and buried him. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus feeds more than five thousand
And when Jesus heard this, he got into a boat and went to a remote place. When the crowds learned this, they left the towns and walked along the roads to follow him.
And when he came down to the shore, he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
And in the evening, his disciples came and said to him, "This place is deserted and it is very late; send the crowds away to the villages and farms so they can buy food for themselves."
But Jesus said to them, "There is no need for them to go away; give *them* something to eat."
His disciples said to him, "We have nothing here but five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said to them, "Bring her to me."
And he ordered the people to sit on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, and he thanked God, raising his eyes to heaven. Then he divided them and gave the loaves to his disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
So they all ate and were satisfied. And they picked up what was left over of the food, and there were twelve baskets full of fragments.
And the number of those who ate was five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on the water.
Then Jesus instructed His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent away the crowd.
And after he had sent them away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat had reached the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing against it violently, because the wind was opposing the direction of the boat.
And just before dawn, Jesus came to them, walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" Filled with fear, they cried out.
Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."
Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the great wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, touched him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind stopped.
And those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, "You are truly the Son of God." Jesus heals many.
And when they crossed the lake, they came to the region of Gennesaret.
And knowing Jesus, the inhabitants of that region declared in all the surrounding area about His coming; and they brought to Him all the sick.
And they begged him, allowing them to touch only the edge of his robe. And all who touched him were healed.
The law of God and the customs of the people.
At that time, some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and asked him,
Why are your students breaking the traditions that we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating.
Jesus answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God because of your traditions?
So God commanded and said, " 'Honor your father and your mother,' " #Honor…your mother. 4:15 from Exodus 20:12, and Deuteronomy 5:16. and said, " 'If anyone curses his father or his mother, he will surely be put to death for having cursed his father or his mother.' " #If anyone curses…he will surely be put to death. 4:15 from Exodus 21:17.
But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "I cannot help you because I have already given everything to God." He is not obligated to honor his father or mother.'
And so you have neglected the commandment of God because of your traditions.
O you hypocrites, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship is futile, because they teach doctrines which are nothing but human precepts.
Jesus called the people to Him and said to them, "Listen to Me and understand what I am saying:
"For it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person."
Then the disciples came to him and said, "Do you not realize that the Pharisees were offended after hearing what you said?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
Leave them alone, for they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit."
Peter answered, "Explain to us the meaning of this parable."
Jesus said, "Do you still not understand?"
Don't you understand that all that goes into the mouth of a person goes into the stomach, and from there it comes out to the outside?
But what comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart. And that is what defiles a person.
Because from the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, blasphemy.
These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.» Jesus Helps a Foreign Woman
Leaving that place, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman who lived in that area came to him and began to cry out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is possessed by a demon and she is very tormented."
Jesus did not answer her at all. His disciples came to him and requested of him, saying, "Send her away from here, because she follows us and shouts."
He said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But the woman approached him and prostrated herself before him, saying, "Lord, help me."
Jesus answered her, "It is not good to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs."
She replied, "That's true, sir, but even the dogs eat the scraps that fall from their master's table."
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be as you wish." And her daughter was healed at that moment. Jesus heals many.
Jesus left that place and went to an area near the Sea of Galilee. He went up to a hill and sat there.
Large crowds came to him, and with them were those who were lame, blind, paralyzed, mute, and many others who were sick. They placed them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them.
And the crowds of people were amazed when they saw the deaf and mute speaking, the lame were healed, the paralyzed were walking, and the blind were seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand.
Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where will we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
Jesus then instructed the people to sit on the ground.
And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and when He had given thanks, He divided the loaves and gave them to the disciples who distributed them to everyone.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftover fragments, and they filled seven baskets.
And the number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitudes away, He went into a boat and went to the region of Magdala.
Jewish leaders examine Jesus.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, and they asked him to give them proof of God's support for him.
Jesus answered them, "When the evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
And in the early morning, you say, "Today will be stormy, because the sky is red and threatening." You are skilled at interpreting the signs of the weather, but you are not skilled at understanding the times in which you live!
This evil, adulterous generation seeks a sign, that they may believe. But no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah.» And Jesus left them and went away. Their lack of understanding.
And Jesus' disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring any bread.
And Jesus said to them, "Be on your guard and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Beginning with the disciples, they spoke to each other, saying, "But we did not bring bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "O little faith, why are you arguing among yourselves about having no bread?
Haven't you realized it yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you filled with the broken pieces?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you filled with the broken pieces?
Why do you not understand that I was not speaking to you about common bread, but I was warning you to guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.»
At that time, his disciples understood that he did not mean to warn them about the leaven of bread, but rather about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Christ.
And when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
His disciples answered, "Some say that you are John the Baptist, others that you are Elijah, and still others that you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "And you, who do you think I am?"
Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
And I tell you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 from the Greek "petros" meaning "rock." And on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades #Gates of Hades. 18:16 that is, the power of death. You will not be able to overcome it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; for whatever is bound on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever is loosed on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.»
Then he sternly warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about the inevitability of his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He must also be killed and rise on the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid it, Lord! This will never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come with me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
What good would it do a person to gain the whole world, yet lose their own soul? And what could a person possibly do to recover their life?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will repay each one according to his works.
I tell you the truth, among those who stand here, there are some who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
Jesus, with Moses and Elijah.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, led them up a high mountain to be alone.
And as they were there, Jesus' appearance changed, and he began to shine like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
And suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as Peter was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground with their faces down.
Jesus approached, touched them, and said, "Get up; do not be afraid."
And when they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah … first. 10:17 Elijah was one of the prophets of God around 850 BC. The Jews were expecting his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Jesus answered them, "Yes, Elijah does come to set all things right.
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people did not recognize him, but treated him as they pleased. And the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
At this, his disciples realized he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus exorcizes an evil spirit from a boy.
And when they returned to the crowd, a man came to Jesus and knelt before him.
And he said: "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is afflicted with epilepsy and suffers greatly. Often he falls into the fire or water."
And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."
Jesus said, "You faithless and twisted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you?" Then he said to the man, "Bring your son here."
Jesus then ordered the unclean spirit to leave the boy, and the boy was immediately healed.
Then His disciples came to Him privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
Jesus answered them, "Because of the little faith you have. I tell you the truth, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. And nothing will be impossible for you."
"But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting." Jesus prophesies his approaching death.
And as they were traveling together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be handed over to the authority of men."
And they will kill him. But on the third day, he will rise from the dead.» So the disciples were very sad. Temple tax
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, he came to Peter, who was collecting the two-drachma tax for the temple; and they asked him, "Doesn't your teacher pay the two-drachma tax?"
Peter answered them, "Yes, he does." Then Peter went into the house. Jesus began to speak to him, saying, "Tell me, Simon, from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their own sons or from strangers?"
Peter answered, "They get them from other nations." Jesus said, "Then the children are exempt from it."
But in order not to cause them any problem, go to the lake, and cast a fishing line. Then take the very first fish you catch, and open its mouth. You will find inside a four-dirham coin. Take it and give it to them on my behalf and on your own."
