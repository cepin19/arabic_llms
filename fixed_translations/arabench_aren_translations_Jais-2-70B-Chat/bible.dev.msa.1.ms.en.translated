The genealogy of Jesus Christ.
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. And Isaac was the father of Jacob. And Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
And Judas begot Pharez and Zarah of Tamar. And Pharez begot Hezron. And Hezron begot Aram.
And Aram begat Amminadab. And Amminadab begat Nahshon. And Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed of Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse.
And Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the son of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the son of Abia. Abia was the son of Asa.
Asa was the son of Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. And Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the son of Jotham, the son of Ahaz, the son of Jotham.
Josiah became the father of Jehoiachin and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.
And after the Babylonian exile, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel. And Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel was born to Abiud; and Abiud was born to Eliakim; and Eliakim was born to Azor;
Azur the son of Sadok, Sadok the son of Achim, Achim the son of Elioud.
And Eliakim was the father of Eliezer. And Eliezer was the father of Mattan. And Mattan was the father of Jacob.
And Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ.
All generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian exile are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: When His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child from the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, did not wish to expose her publicly. He intended to divorce her privately.
But while he was thinking about these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
And all this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel," which, being interpreted, means "God with us."
When Joseph woke up from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and he took his wife.
And he did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he called his name Jesus.
Visit of the Magi
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.
saying, "Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When Herod the king heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So he gathered all the chief priests and the writers of the people, and he asked them, "Where is Christ to be born?"
They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for it is written by the prophet,
And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'
Then Herod secretly called the Magi and inquired of them carefully the time when the star appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the young child. And when you have found him, report to me, so that I may also come and worship him."
When they heard from the king, they departed. And behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
And they came to the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. And they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, when an angel appeared to them in a dream and told them, "Do not go back to Herod," they left by another road to their own region, the flight to Egypt.
And after they departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I bring you word. For Herod the tetrarch is seeking the young child to destroy him."
And when he rose up, he took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. So that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: "Out of Egypt I have called my son."
When Herod saw that the Magi had mocked him, he became very angry. He sent and killed all the young boys in Bethlehem and in all its surrounding areas, from two years old and under, according to the time he had carefully inquired about from the Magi.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying:
A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and great weeping and mourning. Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more. Return to Nazareth.
When Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Saying, "Rise and take the boy and his mother and go to the land of Israel, because those who were seeking the boy's life have died."
He rose, took the boy and his mother, and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Herod Antipas was ruling over the region of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after he was warned in a dream, he departed to the regions of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist paves the way.
And in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying:
Saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.'"
And John the Baptist was clothed with camel's hair, and around his hips was a leather belt. And his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then all Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.
And they were baptized by him in the River Jordan, confessing their sins.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Therefore, bear fruit worthy of repentance.
And do not think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
And now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
The one who has a shovel in his hand will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn. But the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.» The Baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me!"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Allow it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
When Jesus was baptized, he immediately went up out of the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to him.
And a voice from the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus faces temptation.
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was finally hungry.
Then the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
He answered and said, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
Then the devil took him to the holy city, and he stood him on a pinnacle of the temple,
And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' "
Jesus said to him, "It is written again: 'Do not test the Lord your God.'"
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he said to him, "I will give you all these, if you will fall down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him alone shall you serve.'"
Then Satan left him, and behold, angels came and began to minister to him. The Beginning of His Ministry in Galilee
And when Jesus heard that John had been delivered up, he withdrew to Galilee.
And leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphthali.
In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:
"The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, through the Jordan, Galilee of the nations."
The people who dwell in the land of deep darkness have seen a great light; and for those who sit in the region and shadow of death, upon them a light has dawned.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The Calling of the First Disciples
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (the one who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And he said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
For a time, they left the nets and followed him.
Then He passed from there and saw another two brothers: James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; so He called them.
Immediately they left the boat, and their father, and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals the sick.
And Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
And his fame spread throughout Syria. And all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, and the insane, those possessed and paralyzed, were brought to him, and he healed them.
Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan followed him.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
And when he saw the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him.
He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt of the earth and light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
You are the light of the world. No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.
And they do not light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but rather on the lampstand, so that it may give light to all who are in the house.
Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Fulfillment of the Law.
Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish but to complete.
For truly I say to you: until heaven and earth pass away, not even one letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the Law until all is accomplished.
For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become accountable for all of it. But the person who does not know the law of the trespasses, but does the forbidden things, will be subject to the judgment. The one who teaches his neighbor the law will be counted as a great one in the kingdom of heaven. But the one who does the law and teaches it will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you: Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Wrath
You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder; and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'
But I say to you: Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty enough to go to the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the everlasting fire.
If you present your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Therefore, leave your offering there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother; and then come and offer your gift.
Be quick to satisfy your opponent as long as you are both on the road, lest your opponent hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the policeman, and you be thrown into prison.
Truly I tell you: Do not leave there until you have paid the last penny! Adultery.
You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
But I say to you: whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you, because it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Divorce.
And it was said: Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a written bill of divorce.
But I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, unless it is for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The End.
You have also heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not break an oath, but shall fulfill to the Lord the vows you make to Him.'
And I say to you, do not swear at all, not by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
Neither by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let your statement be: 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no.' What is more than this comes from the evil one. Vengeance.
You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other cheek also.
And whoever wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have the cloak as well.
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.
He who asks of you, give to him; and he who wishes to borrow from you, do not turn away from him. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
And I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.
So that you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Charity
Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before people, so that they may see you. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
Therefore, when you make a charitable contribution, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward!
And when you make a gift, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
In order for your charity to be in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full!
And when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases like the Gentiles, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words.
Do not be like them. For your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Let your kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins as we also forgive those who sin against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
And if you do not forgive people their wrongs, your Father will not forgive your wrongs either. Fasting.
And when you fast, do not look somber like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward.
And when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
So that you may not appear to people as fasting, but rather for your Father who is in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is simple, your whole body will be full of light.
And if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. And if the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. God takes care of us.
Therefore I tell you, do not be worried about your life, what you will eat and what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky: they do not sow nor do they reap, nor do they gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Who among you, if he is concerned, will be able to add to his height one cubit?
And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow! They do not toil, nor do they spin.
But I tell you: Not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.
If the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the oven tomorrow, is clothed by God in this way, isn't it much more certain that He will clothe you, you of little faith?
Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
For the Gentiles seek after all these things: for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient for the day is its own evil.
Condemning others.
Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the speck of dust that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the wooden beam that is in your own eye?
Or how will you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the splinter from your eye,' when you have a wooden beam in your own eye?
Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye!
Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and the one who knocks will have the door opened for him.
Or what father among you, if his son asks him for a piece of bread, will give him a stone?
If he asks him for a fish, will he give him a snake?
If, while you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
For whatever you want people to do for you, do the same for them; for this is the Law and the Prophets. The narrow gate.
"Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it!"
The gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and few are those who find it! The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves!
You will recognize them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
Thus every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
No good tree can produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You will recognize them by their fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven. For the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
Many will say to me on that day: Lord, Lord! Is not your name by which we prophesied, and by which we cast out demons, and by which we did many mighty works?
Therefore, I will openly declare to them: 'I never knew you! Go away from me, you evil-doers!' The wise builders and the foolish builders.
Everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
Rain fell, rivers came, winds blew, and it fell upon that house, but it did not fall, because it was founded upon the rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act upon them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they struck that house, and it fell, and great was its fall!».
When Jesus completed these sayings, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
For he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
Healing of a Leper
And when he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And behold, a leper came and prostrated himself before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be clean!" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Jesus said to him, "Look, do not say this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The Faith of the Centurion
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, appealing to him.
And he says, "Lord, my servant lies at home paralyzed and severely tormented."
Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
The centurion answered and said, "Master, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but just say the word and my servant will be healed."
For also I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to one, Go! and he goes; and to another, Come! and he comes; and to my servant, Do this! and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth: I have not found such great faith, even in Israel!
And I say to you, that many will come from the east and the west, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
As for the sons of the kingdom, they will be cast into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and as you believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed that very hour. Healing of Peter's Mother-in-law and Others
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She rose and served them.
And when evening came, they brought to Him many who were possessed by demons; and He cast out the spirits by a word, and He healed all who were sick.
In order for what was said by Isaiah the prophet to be fulfilled, the one who said, "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases," bore the cost of discipleship.
And when Jesus saw the great multitudes around Him, He commanded to go to the other side.
Then a scribe came forward and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." The Calming of the Storm
And when he entered the boat, his disciples followed him.
And a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the waves beat into the boat, and it was already filled. But he was sleeping.
His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
He said to them, "Why are you afraid, O little faith?" Then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the people were astonished, saying, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" He cast out demons.
And when He came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs met Him coming out of the tombs. They were so fierce that no one could pass by that road.
And behold, they cried out, saying, "What have you to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us?"
And a little way from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
So the demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go into the herd of pigs."
And He said to them, "Go." And they came out and went to the herd of pigs; and behold, the entire herd of pigs was rushing down the steep bank into the sea, and they died in the water.
The shepherds fled and went to the city, and reported everything, and about the matter of the two possessed.
And behold, the whole city went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
Healing of a Paralytic
So he entered the boat, crossed over, and came to his own city.
And behold, a paralytic was being carried to Him, laying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven."
And behold, scribes who said within themselves, "This man blasphemes!"
Jesus knew their thoughts, so he said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise up and walk?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then He said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your bed and go to your house."
So he got up and went to his house.
When the crowds saw it, they were amazed and glorified God who had given such authority to people. The Calling of Matthew.
As Jesus was passing by there, he saw a man sitting at the tax office, his name was Matthew. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
And as he reclined at the table in the house, behold, tax collectors and many sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are ill."
Go then, and learn what this is: I desire mercy and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.» The question about fasting.
Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast.
No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, because the new patch will take away from the old garment, making the tear even worse.
And they don't put new wine into old wineskins, lest the wineskins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." The raising of Jairus' daughter and the healing of the woman with the bloody discharge.

However, the provided English translation aims to be as accurate and faithful as possible to the original meaning, while maintaining a professional and natural flow in English.)
And while he was speaking to them, behold, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just now died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose up and he, along with his disciples, followed him.
And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe;
For she said to herself, "If I touch even his clothes, I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the woman was well from that hour.
And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the people making a tumult,
He said to them, "Step aside, for the child is not dead, but is sleeping." And they laughed at him.
When the crowd had been sent out, he went in and took her by the hand, and the young girl arose.
That report went out over all that land. The healing of two blind men.
As Jesus was passing by there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"
And when He came to the house, the blind men came to Him; and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Behold, do not tell anyone!"
But they went out and spread the news in all that land. Another healing of a mute
And as they were going out, behold, a man who was mute and had a demon, was brought to them.
When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, 'By the prince of demons he drives out demons!' Workers are few.
And Jesus was going throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
And when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.
Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."
Sending of the Twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness.
And as for the names of the twelve apostles, they are these: the first Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother. James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
Philip, and Bartholomew. Thomas, and Matthew the publican. James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebaias surnamed Thaddaeus.
Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out and instructed them, saying: "Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no city of the Samaritans.
Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. For freely you have received, freely give.
Do not acquire gold, silver, or bronze in your regions,
Not a road-provider, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff, for the worker is worthy of his food.
"And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave."
And when you enter the house, greet him.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, go out to the exterior, from that house or from that city, and shake off the dust of your feet.
Verily I say unto you: The land of Sodom and Gomorrah shall have in the day of judgment a more tolerable case than that of the city.
Here I am sending you out as sheep among wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
But beware of the people, for they will hand you over to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, to testify to them and to the nations.
So when they hand you over, don't worry beforehand about what to say or how to say it. For you will be given at that moment what to say.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks within you.
And a brother will deliver his brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and will kill them.
And you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
And whenever they expel you from this city, flee to the other. For truly I say to you, you will not complete the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher, and a servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they defame those of his household!
Do not fear them. For nothing is covered that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear the One who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are two sparrows not sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
And as for you, even the hairs of your heads are all numbered.
Fear not! You are more valuable than many sparrows!
So everyone who confesses me before people, I also will confess him before my Father who is in heavens,
But whoever denies me before people, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
For I have come to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And a man's enemies are the members of his own household.
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
He who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. And whoever accepts a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, I tell you the truth, he will not lose his reward."
John the Baptist and not Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist.
John, when he heard in prison about the works of Christ, sent two of his disciples,
And he said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and what you see:
The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
Blessed is the one who is not stumbled by me.
And as these two went, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
But what did you go out into the wilderness to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
I tell you the truth: No one has ever risen among those born of women greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
If you wish to accept him, he is Elijah who is about to come.
Let him who has ears hear.
And to whom can this generation be compared? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their companions.
And they say: We blew the flutes for you, but you did not dance! We slapped our faces for you, but you did not mourn!
For John the Baptist came, eating no food and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
Here is the translation of the provided text: **"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' And wisdom was vindicated by her children.' Woe to the cities that have not repented."**
Then he began to rebuke the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon that were performed in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you: that Tyre and Sidon will be more tolerable in the judgment day than you will be.
And you, Capernaum, exalted to the heavens! You will descend to the depths. For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you: that the land of Sodom will be in a more tolerable condition on the day of judgment than yours." Comfort for the weary.
At that time, Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to children."
Yes, Father, because هكذا became the joy before You.
Everything has been paid to me by my Father, and no one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
Lord of the Sabbath.
At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath among the grain fields, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick tassels and eat.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Behold, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
And He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the presentation, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?
Or have you not read in the Torah that the priests in the Sabbath in the temple defile the Sabbath and they are innocent?
But I tell you: Here is someone greater than the Temple!
For if you had known what this is: I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the innocent!
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.'
Then he left there and came to their synagogue,
And behold, there was a man whose hand was withered. And they asked him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days?" that they might accuse him.
He said to them, "Which of you, having one sheep, falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Wouldn't he grab it and lift it out?"
For even as much as the sheep is better than the goats, so much better are you than the sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days!».
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other. The chosen servant of God.
So when the Pharisees went out, they conspired against Him, to destroy Him,
Jesus knew and left from there. And great crowds followed him, and he healed them all.
And He advised them not to reveal it,
In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:
Behold, my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.
He does not quarrel or cry out, nor does anyone hear his voice in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not quench, until He sends righteousness forth to victory.
And upon his name shall the nations hope." Jesus and Beelzebul
Then a blind and mute madman was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man spoke and saw.
And all the people were amazed and said, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This fellow cannot drive out demons unless he is connected to Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges!
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!
Or else, how can anyone enter the strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven people.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this world or in the one to come.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for by its fruit the tree is known.
"You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
The good person from the good treasure in the heart brings forth good things, and the evil person from the evil treasure brings forth evil things.
But I tell you: For every idle word men may speak, they will give an account on the Day of Judgment.
"لأنك بكلامك تتبرر وبكلامك تدان». آية يونان"
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered and said to Him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
He answered and said to them, "This generation is an evil and adulterous generation; it seeks for a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet."
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here!
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here!
If the unclean spirit comes out of a person, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest but finding none.
Then he says, "I will return to my house from which I came out." So he comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then he goes out and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than he is, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first! So it will also be for this wicked generation." Doing the will of God
While He was speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him.
One of them said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you."
He answered and said to the one who said this to Him, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"
Then he stretched out his hand towards his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
For the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Parable of the Sower and its Explanation
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the sea.
Great multitudes gathered to him, so much so that he entered the boat and sat down. And all the multitude stood on the shore.
And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying, "Behold, the sower went out to sow.
While he was sowing, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it.
And the one on the rocky places, where he did not have much soil; and he sprouted immediately, because he did not have a depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.
And another fell among thorns, and when it grew up, the thorns choked it.
And another fell on good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.
"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."
Then the disciples approached him and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but unto those it is not given.
To him who has, more shall be given, and to him who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand.
For the prophecy of Isaiah concerning them has been fulfilled, which says: "You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
For the heart of this people has become dull, and their ears hard of hearing. Their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should turn for me to heal them.'
But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
For I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see and did not see it; and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.
Listen then to the parable of the sower:
Everyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown on the path.
and the one sown on the rocky places is he who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy,
But it has no root in itself, but is temporary. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, at once he falls away.
And the seed that fell among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
And the seed that fell on the good earth is he who hears the word and understands it. He is the one who brings forth fruit, some a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty." The Parable of the Wheat and Tares
He presented them with another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
While the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.
When the plants came up and produced grain, then the weeds appeared as well.
The servants of the Lord of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where did this tare come from?'
And he said to them, "A man, an enemy, has done this." And the slaves said to him, "Do you want us to go and gather it?"
He said, "No! Lest you pull up the wheat along with the tares when you gather them."
Let them grow both together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers: First gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn, but the wheat gather into my barn». The parable of the mustard seed and the parable of the yeast
He presented them with another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
And it is the smallest of all seeds. But when it is grown, it is the greatest of herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened."
This is all the word with which Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he was not speaking to them.
In order for what was said by the prophet who said: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world." The interpretation of the parable of wheat and tares.
Then Jesus sent the crowds away and came to the house. And the disciples approached him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."
He answered and said to them: "The sower sowing the good seed is the son of man.
The field is the world. The good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The tares are the sons of the wicked one.
The enemy who sowed it is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the angels.
Just as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of this world:
The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all the causes of sin and those who practice lawlessness,
And they shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear. The parables of the treasure, the pearl, and the dragnet.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a person found and hid. Out of joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,
When he found a single pearl of great value, he went and sold everything he had and bought it.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind.
When it was filled, they brought it up to the shore, sat down, and gathered the horses into vessels; as for the bad ones, they cast them out.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: The angels will come out and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
And they shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
Jesus said to them, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
And he said to them, "Therefore, every scribe instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. Nazareth Rejects Jesus
And when he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?"
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Are not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did he get all this from?
So they kept stumbling over it. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house."
And there he did not raise up many mighty ones, because of their unbelief.
The beheading of John the Baptist.
At that time, Herod Antipas, the tetrarch, heard about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist risen from the dead! And therefore, the powers are at work in him."
For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John was saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
And when he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, because he was like a prophet to them.
When Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced in the middle and pleased Herod.
Then he swore an oath that whatever she asked for, he would give her.
She, having been taught by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
But the king was moved with anger, but because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded that it be given.
And he sent and beheaded John in prison.
And so, his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl. She then brought it to her mother.
His disciples came, and they lifted up the body and buried him. Then they came and told Jesus. The feeding of the five thousand men.
When Jesus heard this, he departed from there by ship to a deserted place by himself. But the multitudes heard and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went out, He saw a great crowd; and He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick.
And when evening came, his disciples approached him, saying, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves food."
Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to Him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
So he said, "Bring her here to me."
So He instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowds.
So all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftover fragments, twelve baskets full.
And the eaters were about five thousand men, besides the women and the children. The miracle of walking on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. And when evening came, He was there alone.
And as for the ship, it had come to the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves. For the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" And they cried out in fear!
Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Cheer up! I am he. Do not be afraid."
Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," He said. So Peter got down out of the boat, and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he was afraid. And when he began to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!".
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they entered the ship, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God!"
So when they had crossed over, they came to the region of Gennesaret,
And the men of that place recognized him. And they sent into all that surrounding countryside and brought to him all the sick.
And they begged him, saying, "Just let us touch the edge of your cloak." And all who touched it were made well.
The Pure and the Impure
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which came from Jerusalem, saying:
Here is the English translation of the provided text: **"Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread."**
He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
For God has commanded, saying: Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death.
And as for you, you say, 'Whoever says to his father or his mother, "What you could profit from me is a sacrifice." ' He shall not honor his father or his mother.
You have nullified the commandment of God because of your tradition!
Hypocrites! Well then, Isaiah prophesied about you, saying:
This people draws near to Me with their mouth, and they honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'
Then He called the multitude and said to them, "Hear and understand."
It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person."
Then his disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
He answered and said, "Every tree that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted."
Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."
Peter answered and said to him, "Explain to us this parable."
Jesus said, "Are you also still not understanding?"
Don't you understand yet that all that enters the mouth goes into the belly and is discharged into the latrine?
And whatever comes out of the mouth, its origin is from the heart; and that defiles the man.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
This is what defiles a person. Eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman
Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those regions and cried to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, O Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed."
He did not answer her a word. But his disciples came and besought him, saying, "Send her away, for she crieth after us."
He answered and said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And she came and prostrated herself before him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She replied, "Yes, sir! Even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters!"
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. The feeding of the four thousand men.
Then Jesus left there and came to the region of the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat there.
Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, blind, mute, and many others. And they laid them at Jesus' feet. And he healed them.
So the crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called His disciples and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with Me now three days, and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?"
Jesus said to them, "How much bread do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground,
And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and He thanked [God], and He broke [the bread], and He gave to His disciples, and the disciples gave to the crowd.
So all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftover fragments, seven large baskets full.
And the eaters were four thousand men, besides the women and the children.
Then He sent the multitudes away, and He went up into the boat and came to the borders of Magdala.
Request a sign.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And He answered and said to them: "In the evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
And in the morning: Today is winter because the sky is red with frowning. You hypocrites! You know how to distinguish the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot discern!
"For this generation is a wicked and adulterous generation; it seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And when His disciples came to the other side of the sea, they forgot to take bread.
And Jesus said to them, "Beware, and guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "We have no bread."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think in yourselves, O little faith, saying, 'We have no bread'?"
Do you not understand even now? Do you not remember the five loaves of bread, and the five thousand men? And how many baskets full did you take up?
And how many loaves of bread, the four thousand, and how many baskets did you take?
How do you not understand that I was not talking about bread when I told you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?».
Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's Confession of Christ
And when Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Then Simon Peter answered and said: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
And I also say to you: You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
At that time, he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus Christ. Jesus prophesied his death and resurrection.
From that time, Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise.
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to his works.
Verily I say unto you, There shall be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.

And his appearance was altered before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
Peter began to say to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, I will make here three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While he was speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were exceedingly afraid.
Jesus came, touched them, and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
They raised their eyes and did not see anyone except Jesus alone.

And when they came to the multitude, a man approached him, kneeling before him.
And saying, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is often thrown into convulsions and is suffering greatly. And often he falls into the fire and often into the water."
"And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."

And this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting."
And while they were doubting in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
"Then they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise." They were extremely distressed. Temple tax.
And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
He said, "Yes." When Jesus entered the house, he went ahead of him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tax, from their children or from strangers?"
