The greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a child to Him and placed him in their midst.
And He said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever receives one such child in my name receives me.
It is better for him to have a heavy millstone tied around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks that must come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!
If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or maimed than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to be thrown into the hell of fire, where you have two eyes. Like the lost sheep.
Behold, do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you: their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and look for the one that went astray?
And if he happens to find it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the nine and ninety who did not go astray.
Thus it is not the will before your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
And if he does not hear them, take with you one or two more, that every word may be established on the mouth of two or three witnesses.
And if he does not listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he does not listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
Truly I tell you: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And I also say to you: If two of you agree on earth concerning anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
Because where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began to reckon, one was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents.
And since he had nothing to pay, his master ordered him, his wife, his children, and all that he had to be sold, and the debt to be paid.
The servant took pride and prostrated to him, saying: "Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything."
The master of that servant had compassion on him, released him, and forgave him the debt.
And when that slave went out, he found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him a hundred denarii. He seized him by the throat, saying, "Pay back what you owe me."
The servant's pride was his companion on his feet, and he asked him, saying: Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything.
He did not reply, but went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.
When the slaves his companions saw what had happened, they were very grieved. They came and related to their master all that had taken place.
Then his lord called him and said to him, 'You wicked slave, all that debt I forgave you because you asked me.'
Did it not occur to you that you should also show mercy to your fellow servant, just as I have shown mercy to you?
And his master was angry and handed him over to the torturers, until he paid back everything that was owed to him.
Thus does my heavenly Father do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother his trespasses."
Marriage and Divorce
And when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
And the Pharisees came to Him, testing Him, and saying: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?"
He answered and said to them, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?"
And He said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
"For they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"
He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning, it was not like this."
And I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife, unless it is for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If that is the case of a man with a woman, it is better not to marry!"
And He said to them, "Not everyone accepts this word, but only those for whom it is given."
Because there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers' wombs; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this, let him accept it." Jesus blesses the children.
Then children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
So he put his hands on them, and went from there. The young rich man.
And behold, one came and said to him, "Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
He said to him, "Which commandments?" Jesus said, "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.»
The young man said to him, "All these things I have kept since my youth. So what more do I lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard the word, he went away grieved, for he had great possessions.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!
And I tell you also: That it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!».
And when His disciples heard, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said to them, "This is impossible for people, but with God, all things are possible."
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Behold, we have forsaken all things and followed you. What shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, you who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
Like the workers in the vineyard.
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
So he agreed with the laborers for a dinar per day, and he sent them to his vineyard.
Then going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market idle.
And he said to them, "You also go to the vineyard, and whatever is right, you will receive." So they went away.
And He also went out about the sixth and ninth hours and did likewise.
Then about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle in the market place. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here all day idle?'
They said to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go to the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last ones hired and going to the first ones hired.'
So those who were hired at the eleventh hour came and received each one a dinar.
When the first group came, they thought they would take more. So they also took a dinar each.
And as they were taking, they grumbled against the master of the house.
They said, "These last have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day!"
He answered and said to one of them, "Friend, I have not wronged you! Did we not agree to work for a denarius?"
Take what is yours and go, for I want to give to this last one as I gave to you.
Or what right do I have to do whatever I want with my own property? Or is your eye envious because I am righteous?
"Thus the last will be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few are chosen." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately on the way, and said to them:
Here we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
And they will deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and on the third day he will rise." The request of the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee.
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her two sons, and she prostrated herself and asked him for a request.
And he said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that my two sons may sit, one at your right hand and the other at the left, in your kingdom."
Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? And be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to Him, "We can."
And he said to them, "The cup that is my drink, you will drink. And with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized. But as for sitting at my right hand and at my left hand, it is not for me to give it, except to those for whom my Father has prepared it."
When the ten heard about it, they were filled with rage because of what had happened to the two brothers.
Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
It shall not be so with you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant,
And whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of two blind men in Jericho
As they were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed them.
And as Jesus was going down the road, two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by; and they called out, saying, "Lord, have mercy on us, O sons of David!"
And the crowd rebuked them to be quiet. But they cried out all the more, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, O Son of David!"
Jesus stood up and called to them, saying, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened!"
Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
"Saying to them, 'Go to the village before you, and immediately you will find an ass tied and a foal with it, untie them and bring them to me.'"
And if anyone says anything to you, say, 'The Lord needs them.' And immediately he will send them."
So all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, who said:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
So the two disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them,
And they brought the female donkey and the young donkey, and they put their clothes on them, and he sat on them.
And the multitude that went before him and that followed him, spread their clothes in the way. And others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.
And the crowds who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?"
The crowds said, "This is Jesus the prophet, who is from Nazareth in Galilee." The Cleansing of the Temple
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of those who sold doves.
And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' But you have made it a den of robbers!"
And my uncle approached him and limped into the temple, and they were healed.
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things He did, and the children crying out in the temple, saying, " 'Save us, we beseech thee, O thou Son of David!' " ' the chief priests and the scribes, along with the elders, became enraged
And they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! But have you not read this: 'Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there. The fig tree withers.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry.
Looking, He saw a fig tree by the road; and He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves only. And He said to it, "Never again shall fruit come from you." And immediately the fig tree withered away.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said, "How did the fig tree wither at once?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do the work of the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be removed and cast into the sea,' it will be done.
And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." The question about Jesus' authority.
And when he came to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, saying, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one word; and answer Me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
The Baptism of John: Where did it come from? From heaven or from men? They thought to themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why did you not believe him?'"
And if we say, 'From among the people,' we fear the crowd, because John is regarded by everyone as a prophet.'"
They answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons.
What do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first son and said, "My son, go and work today in my vineyard."
He answered and said, "I don't want to." But he finally regretted it and left.
And he came to the second and said the same thing. And he answered and said, Behold, I am, Lord. And he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of his Father?». They said to him, «The first.» Jesus said to them, «Truly, I say to you, that tax collectors and prostitutes enter the kingdom of God before you.
Because John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. And when you saw it, you did not repent afterward so that you might believe him. Like the vineyard keepers
Listen to another parable: A certain man was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. (Note: This translation is based on the World English Bible (WEB) version of Luke 20:9-16.)
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vine-growers, to receive his fruits.
And the vinedressers took his servants, and some they beat, and some they killed, and some they stoned.
Then he also sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same to them.
Finally, he sent them his Son, saying, 'They will reverence my Son!'
As for the vine growers, when they saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir! Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance!'
So they took him and brought him out of the vineyard and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine dressers?».
They said to him: "Those bad ones, he will destroy them with a bad destruction, and he will give the vineyard to other vineyard keepers who will give him the fruits in their times."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. ' 'This was in the mind of the Lord, and it is amazing in our eyes!' "
Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
And whoever falls on this stone will be crushed; and whoever falls on him will be ground to powder!».
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
And while they were seeking to seize him, they feared the crowds, for they had regard for him as a prophet.
Like the wedding of the king's son.
And Jesus began to speak to them in parables, saying:
«The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son,
And He sent His servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
And he sent also other servants, saying: Tell the invited ones: Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the marriage!
But they took it lightly and went on their way, one to his field and another to his business.
And the rest seized his servants, reviled them, and killed them.
When the king heard that, he became angry, and he sent his soldiers and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants: The wedding feast is ready, but the guests were not worthy.
Go therefore into the main streets of the city, and whoever you find, invite them to the wedding feast.
Those slaves went out to the streets and gathered everyone they found, both evil and good people. The wedding hall became filled with guests.
When the king went in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes.
So he said to him, "O friend, how did you get in here without the wedding garment? And he remained silent."
Then the king said to the servants, "Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"For many are called, but few are chosen." Paying the tribute money to Caesar.
Then the Pharisees went out and laid a trap for him, in order to catch him in his words.
So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not regard anyone's person, for you do not look at people's faces."
Tell us this then. What do you think? Is it permissible to pay a tribute to Caesar, or not?».
Jesus, knowing their malice, said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
"Show me the treatment of the jizya." So they presented a dinar to him.
And he said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
They said to him, "To Caesar." And he said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished and left him and went away. The question about the resurrection of the dead.
On that day, Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and questioned him.
Saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.'
So we had seven brothers, and the first one married and died. Since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And so the second and the third up to the seventh.
And last of all, the woman died too.
On the day of resurrection, out of the seven men, who will be the wife? For she was for all of them!»
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who says:
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" "Is not God the God of the living, not the God of the dead?"
When the crowds heard him, they were astonished at his teaching. The Great Commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together.
One of them, a legal expert, tested him by asking,
"Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?"
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
With these two commandments the entire law and the prophets are related." Christ and David
And as the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
Saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "How then does David, in the Spirit, call him Lord, saying:
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
If David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?».
No one was able to answer him with a word. And from that day no one dared to ask him anything at all.
Beware of the scribes and Pharisees.
Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.
Saying, "The scribes and Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses."
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Therefore, whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do; but do not do as they do, for they do not speak what they do. "
For they tie up heavy, unbearable loads and place them on people's shoulders; yet they are unwilling to even move them with their finger.
And all their actions they do so that people may see them: therefore they display their prayer bands and they magnify the fringes of their garments,
And they love the chief seat at feasts and the foremost places in synagogues,
And greetings in the marketplaces, and for people to call them 'Sir, Sir!'
As for you, do not call anyone on earth 'Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, Christ, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for your Father is one, the one in heaven.
And do not call anyone on earth your teacher, for you have only one teacher, Christ.
And the greatest among you will be your servant.
"Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted." Woe to the scribes and Pharisees.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to do so.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive a greater condemnation.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to win over one convert; and when you have succeeded, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but are full of decay and death on the inside.
O fools and blind! Which is greater: Gold or the Temple which sanctifies gold?
But he that swears by the altar, it is nothing: but he that swears by the offering, by that which he hath to do.
O fools and blind! What is greater: the offering or the altar which sanctifies the offering?
For he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it!
He who swears by the Temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
He who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.
O blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but their inward part is full of extortion and fornication.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside of them may also be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of the bones of the dead and all uncleanliness.
You are also like this: From the outside, you appear to people as righteous, but on the inside, you are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous,
And you say, 'If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
You yourselves bear witness that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
You are filling up the measure of your fathers.
O serpents, offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,
Let come upon you all the righteous blood that has been shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.
"Truly I tell you, all this will come upon this generation!" Jesus wept over Jerusalem.
«O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone the messengers sent to you, how often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!»
Behold, your house is left to you for a ruin.
For I tell you: You will not see me from now on until you say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
Signs of the End Times
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple; and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down!"
And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what is the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Behold! Let no one deceive you.
For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he, the Messiah!' And they will lead many astray.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and plagues, and earthquakes in various places.
But these are all the beginnings of sorrows.
Then they will deliver you to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
And then many will stumble, they will betray one another and hate one another.
Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.
For the love of many will grow cold, because of the increase of transgression.
But the one who endures to the end, that one will be saved.
He proclaims this gospel of the kingdom in all the world, a testimony to all the nations. Then the end will come.
"When you see 'the abomination of desolation' spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place - let the reader understand -"
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
And the one who is on the roof should not go down to take anything out of his house,
Whoever is in the field should not go back to fetch his cloak.
Woe to the women who are pregnant and nursing in those days!
They arrived so that your escape would not be in winter or on the sabbath.
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, and never will be.
And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it.
For there will arise false Christs and false prophets and they will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Here I am, I have already told you.
If they say to you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness!' do not go out; or if they say, 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers!' do not believe it.
For as the lightning comes from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For where the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
And immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And His messengers will be sent with a great trumpet, whose sound will be great, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to their ends.
From the fig tree they learn the parable: When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
Just as you yourselves are, when you see all this, recognize that he is near, at the door.
Truly I tell you: this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Permanent readiness.
But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.
And just as it was in the days of Noah, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,
And they did not know it until the flood came and took them all away. So will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then there will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two women are grinding at the mill; one is taken and the other is left.
Therefore, be ready, for you do not know when your Lord will come.
And know this: if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore, you also must be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect. Just as the faithful servant
Who is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has put in charge of the servants to give them food at the proper time?
Blessed is that slave whom his master finds doing so when he comes!
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
But if that evil slave says in his heart, 'My master is delayed in coming,'
He begins to beat his fellow slaves, and he eats and drinks with the drunkards.
Here comes the master of that servant on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
So he will cut him off and assign his portion with the hypocrites; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Like the ten virgins.
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were wise and five were foolish.
But the foolish took their lamps and did not take oil with them,
And the wise women took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
And as the bridegroom tarried, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, there was a cry: Behold, the Bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!
So those virgins all went out and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
The midwives answered and said, "Perhaps there will not be enough for us. But you go to the merchants and buy for yourselves."
While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
Finally, the rest of the virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open for us!'
He answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Therefore, be ready, because you do not know either the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Like the talents.
And just as a man traveling called his slaves and entrusted his property to them,
And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. And he immediately went away.
So the one who took the five talents went off and put them to use; and he gained five more talents.
And so the one who took the two talents also gained two more talents.
And the one who took the talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's silver.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
So the one who had taken the five talents came and presented five other talents, saying, 'Master, you gave me five talents; see, here are five more I have earned from them.'
And his master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'
Then came the one who had taken the two talents and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents; see, I have gained two more over them.'
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came also that which had taken the one talent, and said, Master, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not scattered:
I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. Here is what belongs to you.
And his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and lazy servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not scattered:
Therefore, you should have taken my silver coins to the money changers. Then, when I came, I could have taken what was mine, along with interest.
Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that he hath.
And the lazy slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the goats.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit upon His glorious throne.
And all the peoples will assemble before Him, and He will separate some of them from others, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
And he will separate the sheep from his right hand and the goats from his left.
Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.'
Because I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.
Naked and you clothed me. Sick and you visited me. Imprisoned and you came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
And when did we see you a stranger and take you in, or see you naked and clothe you?
And when have you seen us sick or imprisoned, and we came to you?
Then the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me.'
"Then He will also say to those on the left, 'Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity, go into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels,'"
Because I was hungry and you did not give me food, I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
You were strangers and you did not take me in. You were naked and you did not clothe me. You were sick and imprisoned and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer Him, saying: Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You?
He will answer them, saying, 'Truly I tell you, to the extent that you did not do it for one of these least, you did not do it for me.'
"Then these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
Conspiring to kill Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples:
You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people assembled at the house of the chief priest, who was called Caiaphas,
And they conspired together to secretly capture Jesus and kill him.
But they said, "Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people." She poured perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the Leper,
A woman approached him, carrying a bottle of expensive perfume. She poured it on his head while he was reclining.
When his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?"
Because this ointment could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for me.
For the poor you will always have with you; but you will not always have me.
For when she poured this perfume on my body, she did it for my burial.
الحق أقول لكم: حيثما يكرز بهذا الإنجيل في كل العالم، يخبر أيضا بما فعلته هذه المرأة تذكارا لها». Then Judas, the traitor, was remorseful and returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
And he said, "What will you give me to betray him into your hands?" So they set for him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time, he was looking for an opportunity to hand him over. The Passover dinner with the disciples.
And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
Go to the city, to so-and-so, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near. Prepare the Passover with my disciples.'"
The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover.
And when it was evening, he went in and reclined with the twelve.
And as they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
And they were very sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, "Is it I, Lord?"
And he answered and said, "The one who dips his hand with me in the bowl, he will betray me!"
The Son of Man is going away, just as it is written about him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!»
Judas, his betrayer, answered and said, "Is it I, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You have said it." The Lord's Supper.
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat. This is my body."
And He took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you,
For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say to you: From now on, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father."
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts Peter's denial of him.
Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me this night. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' "
But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter answered and said to him, "Even if everyone is skeptical about you, I will never be skeptical."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, this very night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" All the disciples also said the same thing. In Gethsemane.
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemani, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here, while I go and pray over there."
Then He took with Him Peter and James and John, and He began to be deeply distressed and very depressed.
And He said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."
Then he came a little further and fell on his face, and he prayed, saying, "Father, if You are willing, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Are you still sleeping and resting? You should have stayed awake with me for just one hour.
"Watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
He went away once more and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass away from me except for me to drink it, let Your will be done."
Then he came and found them also asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them and went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same words specifically.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Sleep now and take your rest! Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Arise, let us go! Behold, he who betrays me is at hand!" The arrest of Jesus.
And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he who delivered him up gave them a sign, saying, "The one whom I will kiss, that is he. Seize him."
And immediately he came to Jesus and said: "Peace, Lord!" And he kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword!"
Do you think that I cannot now ask my Father, and He will provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
So how does the Scripture say this should happen?
At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, "As if against a robber you have come out with swords and clubs to seize me! Every day I was with you teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me."
And all this took place to fulfill what the prophets wrote. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Before the Jewish Council.
And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the chief priest, where the scribes and elders were assembled.
But Peter followed Him at a distance, all the way to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and sat down among the servants to see the end.
And the chief priests and the elders and the whole assembly sought false witness against Jesus to put him to death,
They did not find. Although many false witnesses came, they did not find. But finally two false witnesses came forward.
And they said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.' "
Then the high priest rose up and said to him, "Do you not answer? What do these men testify against you?"
And Jesus was silent. Then the high priest answered and said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said to him, "You have said it! And I say to you also, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!
"What do you think?" They answered and said, "He is deserving of death."
Then they spat in his face and punched him; and others slapped him.
saying: "Tell us, O Christ, who is it that hit you?" Peter's denial
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maid came up to him saying, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean!"
So he denied it before everyone, saying, "I do not know what you are saying!"
Then, as he went out into the vestibule, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, "This one was with Jesus, the Nazarene!"
And he denied it again with an oath, "I do not know the man!"
And after a little while, the men came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you!"
And immediately he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the cock crowed.
Peter remembered Jesus's words to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out to the yard and wept bitterly.
Judah hangs himself.
And when it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death.
And they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
"Then when Judas, the one who betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders."
Saying, "I have sinned in that I have given innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? You see!"
And he cast the silver into the temple and departed, and then he went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not right to throw it into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.
That is why this field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying: 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value.'
And they gave her vinegar to drink mingled with gall. And when she had tasted it, she would not drink.
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You say it."
And while the chief priests and elders were complaining against him, he answered nothing.
Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many testimonies they give against you?"
He did not answer him, not even about a single word, until the governor was very surprised.
The governor was accustomed at the festival to release to the assembly one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
And there was among them at that time a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
While they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?"
Because he knew that they had handed him over out of envy.
While he was sitting on the seat of the governorship, his wife sent a message to him, saying, "Beware of that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream on his account."
But the chief priests and the elders incited the crowds to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
So the governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?" All of them said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
And the governor said, "What evil has he done?" But they kept on crying out, demanding, "Let him be crucified!"
When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was imminent, he took water and washed his hands in full view of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this righteous man's blood! Look to it yourselves!"
So all the people answered together and said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate had Barabbas flogged and released to the crowd. Jesus was then flogged and delivered to be crucified. The soldiers mocked him.
So the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's headquarters. They assembled the entire cohort against him.
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
And they braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they kneeled down before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
And after they mocked him, they took the robe off him, dressed him in his own clothes, and took him out for crucifixion. The Crucifixion.
And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, whose name was Simon, they compelled him to carry his cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which is called "the place of the skull"
They gave him sour wine mixed with myrrh to drink. And when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
And when they crucified him, they divided his garments among themselves, casting lots for them, that the scripture might be fulfilled: "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they placed over his head his accusation written: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Then two criminals were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
And those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads.
"Saying, 'O destroyer of the temple and builder of it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!'"
And also the chief priests, and they were mocking with the scribes and the elders, they said:
Here is the English translation of the provided Arabic text: «He saved others, but he cannot save himself! If he is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him!»
He who has believed in God, let him now save him, if he wants him! For he said: I am the son of God!».
And even then, the two thieves who were crucified with him ridiculed him. Death.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of the people standing there heard this and said, "He is calling for Elijah."
And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.
And the rest said, "Depart! Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him!"
Jesus also cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split,
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose.
And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
And the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with fear and said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women who were looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him.
And among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial
And when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself was also a disciple of Jesus.
This one went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body be given.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And he placed him in his new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock; then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb and went away.
And there were Mary Magdalene and Mary the other, sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
And on the morrow, that followed the preparation, the chief priests
Saying, "Lord, we remember that deceiver said while he was alive, 'After three days, I will rise.'
Therefore, give orders to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples come at night and steal him away, and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead'; and the last deception would be worse than the first!».
Then Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, secure it as you know."
So they went and secured the tomb by placing guards and sealing the stone.
The Resurrection.
And after the Sabbath, at the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And great earthquake happened, because angel of Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away stone from door, and sat upon it.
And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
From his fear, the guards trembled and became like dead men.
And the angel answered and said to the women, "Fear not, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here, because he has risen as he said! Come, let us look at the place where the Lord was lying.
And go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has been raised from the dead.' Behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.'"
So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, running to tell His disciples.
And as they were going to tell his disciples, Jesus met them and said, "Peace be with you." They approached and clasped his feet and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The words of the guards.
And as they were going, behold, a company of the guard came to the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
So they met with the elders, consulted together, and gave the army a great amount of silver.
Saying, "Tell it, 'His disciples came by night and stole him while we were sleeping.' "
And if that is heard by the governor, then we will intercede for you, and we will make you feel secure."
So they took the silver and did as they were instructed; and this saying has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus Appears to the Disciples
And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all days, until the end of the world." Amen.
John the Baptist paves the way.
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the prophets: "Behold, I send My angel before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.
A voice is crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the region of Judea and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
John wore garments of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
And he was preaching, saying, "There is one coming after me who is mightier than I. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The baptism of Jesus Christ and his temptation.
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And immediately, while he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens were split open, and the Spirit, like a dove, was descending to him.
And a voice came from the heavens: "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
And immediately the Spirit drove Him out into the wilderness.
And there he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he was with the wild beasts. And the angels came and served him. The Calling of the First Disciples
And after John the Baptist became a Muslim, Jesus came to Galilee preaching the good news of the kingdom of God.
And he says, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the Gospel."
As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of people."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then He passed from there a little, and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in the boat mending the nets.
He called them immediately. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, and they went after him. A demon spirit was cast out.
Then they entered Capernaum, and immediately upon the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
And they were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out
Crying out, "Ah! What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked it, saying, "Be quiet! Come out of him!"
And an unclean spirit seized him and cried out with a loud voice. And it came out of him.
They were all perplexed, so that they began asking one another, "What is this? What is this new teaching? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!"
And his fame went out immediately in all the region round about the Galilee. Healing of Simon's mother-in-law and others.
And when they came out of the synagogue, they immediately came to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law was lying down and suffering from a fever. And immediately they told him about her.
He approached and raised her up, holding her hand. Immediately, the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
And when evening came, and the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and those possessed by demons.
And the whole city gathered at the door.
And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons, and he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him. The preaching in Galilee.
And very early in the morning, while it was still dark, He arose, went out, and departed to a solitary place, and there He was praying.
Simon Peter and those with him followed him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
He said to them, "Let us go to the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there also, for I have come out for this purpose."
He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and casting out demons. Healing of a Leper
And a leper came to Him, imploring Him and falling on his knees, saying to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said to him, "I want you to be clean!"
And as he spoke, the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
And He rebuked him and sent him away immediately.
And he said to him, "Look, do not tell anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and for your cleansing offer what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
And as for him, he went out and began to proclaim the message widely and to spread the news, until he was no longer able to enter a city openly, but had to stay outside in deserted places, and they would come to him from every direction.
Healing of a Paralytic
Then he entered Capernaum after some days, and heard that he was in a house.
And immediately, many people gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even around the door. And he was speaking to them the Word.
And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic man who was carried by four men.
And when they could not approach him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And after they dug through it, they lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven you."
And some of the scribes were there sitting, and they reasoned within themselves:
«Why does this one speak in such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?»
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that they thus reasoned within themselves, said to them: Why reason you these things in your hearts?
Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Stand up, take your mat, and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic:
To you I say: Arise, take up your bed, and go to your home!
Immediately he left everything, picked up the stretcher, and went out in front of everyone. The crowds were astonished and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" The Call of Levi
Then He also went out to the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.
As he was passing by, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax collector's booth. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
While he was reclining in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were also reclining with Jesus and his disciples, because there were many of them who followed him.
And as for the scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, He said to them, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." The question about fasting.
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast; and they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the sons of the wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast.
But there will come days when the bridegroom is taken away from them; and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the new patch will take away from the old, making the tear even worse.
No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the wineskins, the wine will spill out, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they put new wine into new wineskins.
And he went through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick the heads of grain while they walked.
And the Pharisees said to him, "Look! Why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
And He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those who were with him?
How did he enter the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the bread of the presence, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and he gave those who were with him also?
Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man's sake, and not man for the Sabbath's sake.
"If the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on the Sabbath.
Then He also entered the synagogue; and there was a man whose hand was withered.
So they watched him closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
And He said to the man who had the withered hand, "Get up in the middle!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to destroy it?" And they were silent.
Looking at them with anger, saddened by their hardness of heart, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored, sound like the other.
فخرج الفريسيون للوقت مع الهيرودسيين وتشاوروا عليه لكي يهلكوه. الجموع تتبع يسوع
Jesus went away with His disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee and Judea followed Him.
