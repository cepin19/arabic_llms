And at that hour, the disciples approached Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" Luke 22:24

And he said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Mark"
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomed Walid like this, in my name, is welcoming me.
And if one of these little ones who believe in me sins, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be thrown into the depths of the sea.
Woe to the people of the world for the things that cause sins! Because these things must happen, but woe to the one who causes them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. Matthew 18:8-9
Unless your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 The lost sheep
Beware of despising any of these little ones, for I tell you: their angels in heaven are always with my Father in heaven."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost people." #18.11 This verse is not found in many of the older manuscripts.
What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them goes missing, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go look for the lost sheep?
Let me tell you the truth: if he finds it, he will be happier with it than his happiness with the ninety-nine that were not tainted.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And so, your father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to perish." The brother who sinned.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Unless your brother is in the right regarding your matter, go to him and argue your case privately between the two of you. If he listens to you, you will have won your brother over. This is..."
Otherwise, if he refuses to listen, take one or two people with you so that every word is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church people; if he still refuses to listen, treat him like someone who worships idols or someone who collects taxes.
Let me tell you the truth: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.' Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
Let me say to you again: If two of you agree on earth to ask for something, it will be done for them by my Father in the heavens.
Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." The example of the servant who does not forgive.
Peter approached Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?" Luke
And Jesus said to him, "Not just seven times, but seventy-seven times.
Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he began to judge them, they brought to him someone who owed millions of dirhams of silver in debt.
And since he had nothing with which to repay him, his master ordered him, his wife, his children, and all that he possessed to be sold in order to repay the debt that he owed.
And the servant prostrated himself before him and said: "Be patient with me, my master, and I will return to you everything that is owed to you."
And his master felt pity for him and freed him, and even allowed him to pay off his debt gradually.
And when that slave went out, he found one of his fellow slaves, to whom he owed one hundred dirhams of silver. So he seized him, hanged him, and said, "Return to me what I owe you!"
His companion fell to his feet, begging him, and said to him: "Wait for me and I will pay you back what I owe you."
But he didn't want to, so he took him and threw him in prison until he pays off the debt he owes.
And when the slaves saw what happened to their companions, they were very sad and went to inform their master about everything that had happened.
And his master was rebuking him, saying to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave you that entire debt because you pleaded with me."
Well then, why didn't you have mercy on your friend, just as I had mercy on you?
And his lady is worried, and sends him to prison so they can torture him until he returns what he owes.
Here is how our father who is in heaven will deal with you if each of you does not forgive his brother from his heart.'
Chapter 19: Jesus Teaches About Divorce.
And when Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the regions of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
Many groups of people followed him and he healed them there.
And the Pharisees approached him and questioned him, testing him: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"
And he answered them, saying: "Have you not read in the Book of God that God created man from the beginning, male and female?"
And He said: 'This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh.'
And so they will no longer be two, but they will become one flesh. And what God has put together, no human being can tear apart."
And the Pharisees came and asked him, "Why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce to the woman who is divorced?" Matthew
Jesus answered them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "I tell you: whoever divorces their spouse for some reason other than sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
And his disciples said to him, "If this is the case with a man and his wife, it is better not to marry at all."
Jesus answered them, "Not everyone accepts this message, only those whom God has chosen to accept it.
Here are a few possible translations, with slight variations in emphasis and nuance: **Option 1 (Closer to a literal translation):** > "Because there are people who were born of their mothers' wombs who are
And people brought him some young children so he could lay his hands on them and pray for them, and the students argued with those who brought them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he put his hands on them and walked away from there. The well-dressed young man.
And a young man came to him and said, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? God alone is good. If you want to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments."
And he said to him, 'What commandments?' And Jesus answered, 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
"Love your father and mother, and love those who are close to you as you love yourself."
The young man said to him: "I have done all these recommendations, so what else do I need?"
Jesus answered him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me!"
But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth: it is difficult for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
And I tell you further: 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!'».
The students were very amazed when they heard this speech, and they said: "If that's the case, who will be able to survive?".
And Jesus looked at them and said to them: "People cannot do this, but God is able to do all things."
Peter answered him and said, "Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What will be our reward?"
And Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, in the regeneration when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Matthew 19:28-30
And whoever permitted it in his homes, or his brothers, or his sisters, or his father, or his mother, or his children, or his lands on account of my name, he will have what he permitted returned to him a hundred times over, and he will be given eternal life with God.
Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first." Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter twenty, the example of workers in the vineyard.
«The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who had a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
And he paid them a dinar per day and sent them to his garden.
He went out around nine o'clock in the morning and found other workers standing in the market without work.
And he says to them: Go, you too, to my garden, and I will pay you what you deserve.
And they left. And he went out again around midday, and went out again at three o'clock in the afternoon, and took on more workers.
He went out again around five in the evening, and found other workers standing there. He said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day without work?"
And they answered him, "Because no one has hired us." And he said to them, "Then go to my orchard as well."
And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired up to the first ones hired.'
And those he had hired at five in the evening came, and each of them took a dinar.
And when the first ones came, they thought that they would be paid at a higher price, but they also got only one dinar each.
And when they were being paid, they started complaining about the owner of the property.
And they say: Those others worked only one hour and you paid them the same wage as us, who remained working all day in the sun.
And he answered the king's man, one of them, and said to him: I have not wronged you, my friend, have I not agreed with you on a dinar?
Well, take your right and go as you are! And this is what came last, I'm the one who wanted to give it to you as well.
Don't I have the right to dispose of my money as I wish? Or are you envious because I am generous?».
And Jesus said, "Thus the last will be first, and the first will be last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus prophesies for the third time about his death and resurrection.
And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took his twelve disciples aside by themselves, and said to them on the way:
Here we go up to Jerusalem, and behold, someone will betray the Son of Man so that he is handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
And they will hand him over to those who do not know God, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him. And on the third day, he will be resurrected from the dead." The mother of James and John asks Jesus about her sons.
And the mother of the sons of Zebedee came with her sons to Jesus, and she prostrated herself before him and requested from him to grant her a certain thing.
And he said to her, "What do you want?" And she said to him, "Command that my two sons sit down, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
And Jesus answered them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup of suffering that I am about to drink?" And they said to him, "Yes, we can!"
And he said to them: "Truly, my cup you will drink, but the seating on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give, for it is to be given to those for whom it is prepared."
And when the ten disciples heard this, they were very concerned about James and his brother John.
And Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Luke
And you, this should not be among you. But whoever wants to be great among you must become your servant. Matthew
And whoever wants to be first among you must become your servant.
And so man was born, not to be served by people, but to serve and to give his life for many people." Jesus heals two blind men.
And at the time when they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd of people followed Jesus.
And they were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to cry out and say: "Have mercy on us, O Lord, O son of David!"
And even though the people scolded them to be quiet, they kept shouting even more and saying: "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!".
And Jesus stood up and rebuked them, asking them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
And they answered him, "We want our eyes to be opened, my lord!"
And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Chapter twenty-one: Jesus enters Jerusalem.
And when they approached Jerusalem and came to the village of Bethphage, which is near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples
And he said to them, "Go to the village that is in front of you, and you will find a donkey tied up, with a young donkey, untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them: 'The Lord needs them, and he will send them back soon.'
And all this happened so that the words of the prophet who said would be fulfilled.
«Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, even a colt, the foal of a donkey.'»
And the two disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
And they brought the donkey and the foal, and they put their belongings on them, and Jesus rode on top of them.
A large group of people spread their belongings on the road, and others cut down palm fronds and spread them on the road.
And the crowds of people who preceded Jesus and those who followed him were shouting and saying: "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Glory to God in the highest heaven!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole population of the city was stirred up, and they began to say: "Who is this?"
And the crowds of people answered them, saying, "This is Jesus, the prophet, who is from Nazareth, which is in Galilee." Jesus drove out the buyers and sellers from the house of God.
And Jesus entered the house of God and went to all those who were selling and buying there, and he overturned the tables of those who exchanged money and the chairs of the pigeon sellers.
And he said to them: "It is written in the Book of God that my house will be called the house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!"
And blind and lame people came to him in the house of God, and he healed them.
But the religious leaders, the scholars of Islamic law, were worried when they saw the miracles that Jesus performed, and when they heard the children shouting in the house of God, saying: "Glory to the Son of David!".
And they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus answered and said, "Yes, have you never read in the scriptures: 'From the mouth of infants and nursing babes you have prepared praise for yourself'?"
And after he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he spent the night there. Jesus curses the vine.
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he felt hungry.
And he saw a vineyard by the roadside; he went to it but found nothing on it except leaves. And Jesus said to it, "May there never be fruit from you again!" And immediately the vine withered.
And when the students saw what had happened, they were amazed and said, "How did the vine wither so quickly?"
And Jesus answered them, saying, "I tell you the truth: if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you tell this mountain to be lifted up and thrown into the sea, it will be done. Matthew 17:14-21
And whatever you ask for in prayer, with faith, you will receive it." Who gave the authority to Jesus?
And when Jesus came to the house of God, teaching there, the chief priests of the religious leaders and the elders of the people came to him and said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them and said to them: "I also want to ask you one question, and if you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men? And they discussed it with one another and said, 'If we say, "From heaven," he will say to us, "Why then did you not believe him?"
Otherwise, we would have said it came from among the people. We are afraid of the people because they consider John a prophet."
And they answered Jesus and said to him, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons.
What do you think about a man who had two sons, and he went to the first son and said to him: Go my son and work today in my vineyard.
And his son answered him and said to him: I don't want to. But he regretted it later and left.
And the bull went up to the other boy and said to him what he had said to the first boy, and he answered him and said: Very well, sir! But he didn't go.
Here is the English translation: "So who among these two did what Mourad's father did?" They said to him, "The first." And Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you."
Because John 21:32 refers to John the Baptist. He came to you on the path of truth, and you did not believe in him. But tax collectors and prostitutes believed in him. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe in him." Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parable of the vineyard and the vine dresser.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Listen to another proverb: There was a man who owned a plot of land. He planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a wall, dug a press in it, and built a tower. He rented it to some vine growers and went away."
And when the time came for the grapes to be harvested, he sent his slaves to the vineyards to take his produce.
And the gardeners got up, seized the slaves, and beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another to death.
And he sent again other slaves, more than the first, and they made them gardeners as they had made the others.
In the end, he sent his son to them and said: "They will respect my son."
But when the gardeners, the son of the garden owner, saw him, they said to each other: This is the one who will inherit! Let's go kill him and take his inheritance!
And they grabbed him and took him outside the garden of grapes and killed him.
Well, if the owner of the vineyard comes, what should he do to those gardeners?».
And they answered him, "Those crooked ones will finally meet a bad end. He will give the vineyard to other gardeners who will give the fruits in their due time."
And Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is amazing in our eyes!'"
Therefore I say to you: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruits.
"He who falls on this stone will be shattered into pieces, and the stone will crush whoever it falls on."
And when the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who had come from every village of Judea heard what he said, they understood that he was speaking about them.
And they began to look for ways to capture him, but they were afraid of the groups of people because they considered him a prophet.
Chapter twenty-two, the example of the wedding invitation.
And Jesus spoke again to the multitude, saying:
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call the guests, but they would not come.
And he sent other servants again, and he said to them, 'Go to the invited guests, and say to them, "I have prepared my dinner, and I have killed the oxen and the fattened calves. And all is ready." So, come to the dinner!
But they didn't pay attention to him. Some of them went out to their acre of land, and some of them went out to buy and sell.
And others of the exhibitors grabbed his slaves, taunted them, and killed them.
And the king was worried and sent his army, and those murderers were destroyed, and their city was burned.
And he's telling his slaves: The wedding is ready, but those we invited are not worthy.
Okay, here's the translation: "So, go now to where the roads meet, and invite everyone you find to the wedding."
And the servants went out to the roads and gathered everyone they found, not just the good people but also the bad ones, until the wedding house was full of guests.
And when the king went in to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing the wedding clothes.
And he says to him: How did you do it, my friend, to get in here and you're not wearing the wedding clothes? And the man fell silent because he had nothing to say.
And he said, 'The king said to the servants, "Tie his hands and feet and throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth." Matthew
Many were exposed, but few were chosen." The tax payment to Caesar.
And the Pharisees went out at that very hour, consulting with one another to trap Jesus in His speech.
And they were sending their disciples to him along with the Herodians, and they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and you teach the way of God in truth, and you do not show partiality, for you do not care about a person no matter what his status may be."
So, tell us what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
And Jesus knew their hypocrisy, and said to them: "Why do you try to test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the money with which you pay the tax!». And they showed him a dinar.
And He asked them, "Whose image and inscription are on these coins?"
They said to him, "Caesar's!" And he said to them, "Well then, give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and give to God the things that are God's!"
And when they heard him, they were astonished, left him, and went away. The question is about the resurrection of the dead.
And that very day some Sadducees, who deny that the dead are raised, came and asked him,
"O master, said Moses: If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother shall marry his wife to raise up children for his brother."
And we had seven siblings. The eldest got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife for his brother to marry.
And so it happened to the second, the third, all the way to the seventh.
And in the end, after they all died, the woman died too.
So, which of these seven will be the man of this woman on the Day of Resurrection? Because they were all her husbands."
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God."
Because on the day of the resurrection, people will not get married, nor will they give their daughters in marriage, but they will be like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read God's word to you when He said:
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"Am I not the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" God said, "It is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."**
And when the multitudes of people heard these words, they were astonished at his teaching. The Great Commandment
And when the Pharisees heard the news that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, who was a scholar of the law, rose up to test Jesus and said:
"Oh sir, what is the great commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered him and said to him: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second commandment is the same: you should love your neighbor as yourself.
And upon these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets." Luke 10:25-28 The Messiah and the Prophet David
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying:
"What do you think about the Messiah?" he asked. "Whose son is he?" They replied, "He is the son of David!"
And He asks them: "So, how did David, by the revelation of the Spirit of God, call him 'my Lord' when He said:
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
So, if David calls Christ his Lord, how can Christ be his son?».
And not a single person was able to answer him with a single word, and not a single person dared from that day on to ask him any further questions.
Chapter twenty-three: Jesus advises his disciples to be careful of the religious men and the Pharisees.
And Jesus spoke to the groups of people and to his disciples.
And He said, "The scholars of the law and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses,
So, do everything they tell you to do and follow their instructions, but don't act like them because they don't do what they preach.
They bind heavy and difficult bundles to carry, and they place them on the shoulders of people, but they themselves do not move a finger to carry them along.
Otherwise, if they do something, they only do it so that people can see them. They expand their gangs on their arms and on their foreheads. They lengthen their jalabas.
And they like to be in the best places at parties, and the front seats in places of worship,
And they like it when people greet them in the markets and call out to them: "Oh, sir."
But you, do not let anyone call you: 'Sir', because you are all brothers and have one Master.
And don't call anyone on this earth 'father', because you have one Father, the Father in heaven.
And do not let anyone call you 'Rabbi,' because you have only one teacher, the Messiah.
And the greatest among you shall be your servant. Matthew
For he who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You neither enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to do so.
But woe to you, teachers of religious law and you, Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but are full of decay and death on the inside. So also on the outside you appear righteous to others, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, Pharisees and experts in the law, you hypocrites! For you cross sea and land to make a single convert, and when he becomes a convert, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!
Oh woe to you, blind officials! You say that swearing by the House of God, his oath is not acceptable, but whoever swears by the gold of the House of God, he must fulfill his oath.
Ah, this foolishness and blindness! As for Hassan, is gold more important than God's house, which makes gold sacred?
And you say again: Whoever swears by the altar, his oath is not acceptable; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, he must fulfill his oath.
Ah, these blind men! Why is one better? The sacrifice, or the slaughterhouse that makes the sacrifice sacred?
Because the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by all that is above it.
And he who swears by the House of God, he swears by it and by God who dwells in it.
But I say to you, do not take an oath at all, not by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the king's city.
Woe to you, O scholars of the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you neglect the more important matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These you should have practiced without neglecting the less important matters.
Oh, these blind officials! You're straining the water to remove mosquitoes, but you're swallowing a camel.
Woe to you, the scholars of the law and you, the hypocritical Pharisees! You are like those who clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
Ah, this Pharisee, blind! Clean first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that they may become clean also to you outside.
Woe to you, the scholars of the law and you, the hypocritical Pharisees! For you are like beautifully decorated tombs which appear beautiful on the outside but inside them are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean. Your deeds
And so on until we finish. From the outside, you appear to people as fearing God, but from the inside, you are full of hypocrisy and sins.
Woe to you, O scholars of Islamic law and hypocritical Pharisees! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the shrines of the righteous.
And they say: If only we had lived in the time of our ancestors, we would not have participated at all in the killing of the prophets.
And so you bear witness against yourselves that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Well, you lot continue what your ancestors started.
Oh, these vipers, offspring of serpents! How will you manage to escape the torment of hell?
Therefore, I will send you the prophets, the wise men, and the religious scholars. Among them, you will kill some, crucify some, and beat some in your places of prayer and drive them out from city to city.
So that the punishment of all pure blood shed on earth may descend upon you, from the blood of Abel, who was righteous before God, to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And I tell you the truth: all this judgment will fall on this generation!» Jesus' love for Jerusalem"
Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing.
And here is your home, it will remain a ruin for you.
And I tell you: You will not see me from now until you say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
Chapter twenty-four, Jesus prophesies that the house of God will be destroyed.
And Jesus went out and walked to the house of God, and his disciples came to him to show him the building of the house of God.
And Jesus said to them, "Have you seen all these things? Truly, I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another, but will be thrown down." Signs of the End Times
And when Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, His disciples came to Him and asked Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"
And Jesus answered them, saying, "Be careful that no one deceives you!"
Because many people will come in my name and say, 'I am the Messiah!' and deceive many people.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; do not be alarmed! For these things must occur, but the end is not yet."
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and earthquakes in various places.
But all this is just the beginning of the pain.
That clock will deliver you to those who will torture and kill you. And all the peoples of the world will hate you because of my name. Maathai.
And at that time, many people will turn away from their faith, they will betray each other, and they will hate each other.
And many false prophets will appear and greatly mislead many people.
And because of the multitude of sins, the love of many people will grow cold.
But the one who remained steadfast until the end, that one will be saved. When?
And he will proclaim this good news of God's kingdom throughout the whole world, and it will be a testimony to all the nations of the world. And then the end of times will come." The great ordeal.
And when you see in the holy place the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel - let the reader understand!
That clock, the one in the Jewish town, they would flee to the mountains.
And the one on the roof must not come down to take what is in his house. Luke
And whoever was in the field would not come back to take his clothes.
And woe to the pregnant women and the women who are breastfeeding during those days.
Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
And in that time, a great disaster will occur the likes of which have never been seen from the time God created the world until now, and it will never happen again after that. The Vision.
And if those days were not shortened by God, no human being would survive, but because of those whom God chose in those days, they will be shortened.
And if anyone says to you at that time, 'Here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
Because false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders, and they will try to lead astray, if possible, even those whom God has chosen.
Well, I already told you before.
They will tell you: He is in the desert! Don't go out, or He is in the inner rooms! Don't believe them. Look!

"Where there is a carcass, there the eagles will gather." Luke 17:37 The coming of the Son of Man
And after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And at that hour, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory. The Apocalypse
And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, to gather those who have been chosen for him from the four corners of every place under the sky." The Parable of the Vineyard
And learn this parable from the vineyard: When its branches are luxuriant, and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
And so until it is completed, when you see all these things happening, know that he is about to come, and he is at the door.
Let me tell you the truth: by the time this generation is over, all these things will have happened.
Here is the translation of the provided text: " 'The heaven and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.' The day and hour are unknown."
As for that day and that hour, no one knows them, not the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
And as it happened in the days of Noah, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark.
And they did not know what would happen, until the flood came and swept them all away. Thus will be the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, there will be two in the field. One will be taken, and the other will remain.
And there will be two women grinding grain at the millstone. One will be taken, and the other will remain.

Because of this, you too must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at a time when you least expect him." The example of the faithful servant.
And who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household servants to give them food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant who, when his master comes, will find him doing the very thing his master commanded him to do.
Let me tell you the truth: He's going to cost him everything he owns.
If that slave was ugly, he would say to himself: My master will be delayed in returning.
And he began to beat his slave companions, and to eat and drink with the drinkers,
The master will come to that slave one day he did not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
And He will punish him severely and make him dwell with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Chapter twenty-five: The example of ten single women.
And the time came when the Kingdom of Heaven would be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Luke
And there were five of them who were silly, and five others who were sensible.
And they, those five foolish men, carried their lanterns without taking extra oil with them.
The five wise ones took their lanterns with them, and oil in bottles.
And when the groom was late, all the single women started gathering until they fell asleep.
And at midnight, you hear a loud voice saying: Here comes the groom, go out to meet him!
And they woke up all the virgins, and they found their candles.
And they said, the foolish ones to the wise ones: Give us some of your oil, because our lanterns are about to go out.
But the wise women answered them and said: It may not be enough for us and you, go buy it from those who sell it.
And when they were going to buy the oil, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready for the wedding went in with him, and the door was shut.
And afterward, the other virgins came and said, 'Lord, Lord, open for us!' Luke
But the bridegroom answered them, saying, Verily I know you not.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Therefore, it is because of this that they stay awake, for you know neither the day nor the hour [when the Son of Man will come] # 25.13 The end of this verse is not found in many of the older manuscripts."
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was going to travel, and he called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions, Luke 12:41-44. The example of the talents of money.
And he gave one person five handfuls of money, and to the second two and to the third one handful, each one according to his effort. And he traveled.
And that guy who took five sacks of money started buying and selling with them, and made another five sacks of profit.
And the one who took two handfuls of change also won two more handfuls of change.
As for that one who took only one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the bag that his master had given him in it.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves returned and settled accounts with them.
Here is the English translation: "And he comes to him, the one who took five dirhams and paid with them five more dirhams, and said: 'Sir, you gave me five dirhams, well then, here are the other five that I won as profit.' "
And his master said to him, "I have nothing to ask of you. You are a good and faithful servant! You were faithful to me in small matters, and now I will entrust you with greater matters. So come, rejoice with your master."
And then, came the one who took two handfuls of grain as well, and said: "Oh my master, you have given me two handfuls of grain, well then, here are two more handfuls that I have won additionally."
And his master said to him, "I have nothing to ask of you. You are a good and faithful servant! You were faithful to me in small matters, and now I will entrust you with greater matters. So come, rejoice with your master."
And after that, the one who took a single bag also came to him and said: "Oh my master, I know that you are a harsh man, you reap what you have not sown and you gather what you have not done."
Because of this, I was afraid and went to hide your bag in the ground, and now here is your livelihood.
And his master answered him and said to him: Well, you are an ugly and lazy slave! Isn't it enough that you know I harvest what I did not sow and I gather what I did not do?
Well, you should have put my money with the money traders, so that when I return, I can take it back with its profit.
Take this bag from him and add it to the one belonging to the person who has ten bags.
For everyone who has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. But for the one who does not have, even what they have will be taken away from them." - Matthew
And the worthless slave who did nothing was thrown outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' Matthew 8:12; 22:13; Luke 13:28 The Son of Man will judge the nations.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. Matthew
And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will drive the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
And after that, the King will say to those who are on His right: Come, you who are blessed by my Father! Inherit the Kingdom of God, which has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.
Because I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, and I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, and I was a stranger and you took me in.
Naked, you clothed me; sick, you visited me; in prison, you came to me.
On that day, those who did the will of God will answer him and say: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?'
And when did we see you as a stranger and we welcomed you? Or naked and we clothed you?
And when have we seen you sick or in prison and we came to you?
And the king will answer them and will say to them: Let me tell you the truth: every time you did this to one of my little brothers, you did it to me!.
And He will say again to those on His left: Depart from Me, you cursed ones, to the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels,
Because I was hungry and you did not give me food, and I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
And I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, and naked and you did not clothe me, and sick and in prison and you did not come to me.
And on that day, they will answer him and say: 'Lord! When did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or in prison, and we did not help you?'
And the king will answer them and say, "I tell you the truth: because you did not do this for the least of these, you did not do it for me."
They will go to eternal torment, and those who did the will of God will go to eternal life."
Chapter twenty-six, the Jews consult to kill Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished all this talk, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter will be in two days' time, and the Son of Man will be handed over by the people so that he can be crucified.
And the time, they gathered the heads of the religious men and the elders of the people in the house of Caiaphas, the chief of the religious men.
And they consulted with one another to seize Jesus by deception and kill him,
But they said, "We should not do this on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people." The woman who poured the perfume on Jesus.
And when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman approached him carrying an expensive bottle of perfume, which she poured over his head while he was sitting next to the dining table. Luke
And when his students saw what she had done, they were displeased and said, "Why this waste?"
Because this scent could have been sold for a high price, and its proceeds distributed to the poor."
And when Jesus knew what they were discussing with each other, He said to them, "Why are you distressing this woman? For she has done me a great kindness,
Since the poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
And when she poured this scent all over my body, she poured it to prepare me for burial.
Let me tell you the truth: Wherever people preach the Good News to the whole world, they will speak about what this woman has done and they will remember her." Judas the traitor agreed to betray Jesus.
And having said this, one of the twelve disciples, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
And he said to them, "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" And they agreed with him for thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time on, Judas was looking for the opportunity to hand Jesus over. The Passover dinner with the disciples.
On the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
And he answered them, saying, "Go to the city, to such-and-such a person, and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord: Behold, the time of my departure is near, and I will go to keep the Passover at my place, I and my disciples.'"
And the disciples did everything Jesus had commanded them. They prepared the Passover meal.
And when it was time for dinner, Jesus sat at the table to eat with the twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said to them, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
And the students were very sad, and each one of them began to ask him: "Is it me, sir?".
And he answered them, saying: "The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl, he is the one who will betray me!"
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "The son of man is going to be betrayed and killed, just as it is written about him in the word of God. But woe to that man who betrays the son of man! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born."
And he said to him, "You have said it." The Lord's Supper.
And when they were eating, Jesus took bread, thanked God, broke it, and gave it to His disciples and said: "Take, eat, this is My body,"
And after that, he took the cup, thanked God, gave it to them, and said, "All of you drink from it."
For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say to you: From now on, I will no longer drink this grape juice until the day comes when I drink it with you anew in the kingdom of my Father."
And after they worshipped God and went out, they went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus prophesied that Peter would deny him.
And Jesus said to them, "This very night, before it is over, you will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' "
"But after I was raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee." Matthew
Peter answered him, saying, "Even if they all betray you, I will never betray you!"
And Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter answered him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane.
And the time came, Jesus went with his disciples to a garden called Gethsemani, and he said to them: "Sit here while I go and pray over there!".
And after that, he was with Peter and the sons of Zebedee together, and he began to feel worried and distressed.
And He said to them: "My soul is very sorrowful, even unto death; remain here and watch with me!"
And after a while, he prostrated himself and began to pray, saying: "Oh Father! If it is possible, spare me this ordeal, but not as I want, but as You want."
And after he returned to the disciples, he found them sleeping. And he said to Peter: "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Be vigilant and pray so that you do not fall into temptation, for the spirit is strong but the body is weak."
As he walked for the second time, he prayed and said, "Oh Lord! If this trial could pass by me without me tasting it, then so be Your will."
And he went back and found them asleep, because sleep overcame them.
And he left them and walked again, and prayed for the third time and repeated the same thing.
From afar, he came to his disciples and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners."
Wake up, let's go! Here comes the one who will betray me." Jesus was arrested.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived, who was one of the twelve disciples, and with him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, whom the chief priests and elders of the people had sent.
And the one who handed him over had given them a sign and told them: "The man I will kiss is the one, seize him!"
And at that very moment, Judas, one of Jesus' disciples, approached him and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" And he kissed him.
And Jesus says to him, "Why have you come, my friend?" And they approached Jesus and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place! For all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Do you think that I am not able to call my father right now, and he will send me more than twelve teams of military angels?
But how will the words in God's book be fulfilled, which says that this is how it is supposed to be?».
And at that very hour, Jesus said to the crowds: "Why have you come out with swords and clubs to capture me, like you would a robber? Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me!" Luke
But all this happened so that what was written in the prophets' books would be fulfilled." And then all the disciples forsook him and fled. Jesus before the Jewish court
But those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the chief priest, where the religious scholars and elders were gathered.
Peter followed him from a distance all the way to the house of the chief religious leader. He entered and sat down with the servants to see what would happen in the end.
And the religious leaders, the senior court officials, were searching for false testimony against Jesus in order to kill him.
But they didn't find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two witnesses appeared.
And they said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.' " John
And the high priest arose and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer what these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent, as the chief priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus answered him, "You have said it yourself! Yet I will tell you: From now on, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty God, and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
And at that moment, the head of the religious men confronted his belongings and said: "This is blasphemy! We no longer have anything to do with witnesses, you have heard his words of blasphemy."
"So, what do you all think?" They answered him, saying, "He deserves to die!"
And they spit on his face and hit him, and some of them slapped him.
And they said, "Now prophesy to us, O Christ, who is he who smote thee?" Peter denied Jesus.
Peter was sitting outside, in the courtyard of the house, when a servant girl came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus, the one from Galilee!"
He denied it in front of everyone present and said: "I don't know what you're saying!".
And then, he went into the courtyard of the house, and another maid saw him and said to those who were there: "This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth!".
Then Peter denied it again, and swore, "I don't know this man!"
And after a while, those who were standing there came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for you have the speech of one who is from Galilee!"
And he began cursing and swearing and saying, "I absolutely do not know this man!" And at that very moment, the rooster crowed.
Peter thought about the words that Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out to the outer area and wept bitterly.
Chapter 27
And very early in the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people, assembled together against Jesus to put him to death.
And they bound him and brought him and handed him over to the governor Pilate. Judas Iscariot hanged himself.
And at that very hour, when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. Acts
And he said to them: "I have sinned because I handed over an innocent man." And they said to him: "It's not our business, sort yourself out."
And Judas threw the silver cock into the house of God, and then went and hanged himself.
And the chief priests and the scribes took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this into the treasury of the house of God, for it is the price of blood."
And they agreed to buy with it a acre of potter's field and turn it into a garden for strangers,
And that's why people call this acre "feddan ed-dam" ( فدان الدم ) until today.
And at that time, that which the Lord had inspired the prophet Jeremiah to speak, came to pass, when he said, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they of the children of Israel did estimate him,
And with that amount, they bought a field in Potters, as the Lord had instructed me." Jesus before the governor Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned him and said, "Are you the king of the Jews?" And Jesus answered him, "You have said it."
And when the presidents of the religious men and the elders accused him, he did not answer them with anything.
And Pilate said to him, "Have you not heard how many testimonies they are giving against you?"
And Jesus answered him not a word; and the governor marveled greatly.
It was the custom of the ruler that every Easter he would release one of the prisoners whom the people desired.
And at that very moment, they had a famous prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
And when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Since Pilate knew that, out of envy, they had delivered Jesus to him.
And when Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests, the religious men and the elders incited the groups of people to ask Pontius Pilate to release Barabbas to them and to kill Jesus.
And Pilate asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they answered, "Barabbas."
And Pilate said to them, "Well then, what shall I do with Jesus called the Messiah?" And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
And he said to them, "What evil has he done?" But they kept on shouting, and they said to him, "Crucify him!"
And when Pilate saw that nothing was working with them and the people had become even more agitated, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd of people and said: "I am innocent of the blood of this man, see to it yourselves!"
And he answered him, the whole people said: "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
And at that very hour, Pilate released Barabbas to them; but as for Jesus, he delivered him to them to be crucified; and after they had mocked him. The soldiers were laughing at Jesus.
And they brought the military of the ruler Jesus to the governor's palace, and they gathered the entire detachment of soldiers against him.
And they stripped him and dressed him in a red solham,
And they braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a reed in his right hand, and they began to kneel before him and to laugh at him and to say: "Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they jumped on him, took the cane, and hit him on the head with it.
And after they mocked him, they took off his robe and dressed him in his own clothes and took him away to be crucified. Jesus is being crucified.
And as they were going out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry the cross of Jesus.
And they arrived at the place which I called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
And they gave him to drink wine mixed with a herb called myrrh, and when he tasted it he did not want to drink it.
And they crucified him and divided his belongings among themselves after they had pierced him with a spear.
And they remained sitting there, guarding him.
And above his head, they placed a board on which was written his accusation: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
And that hour they crucified him with two thieves, one on his right and the other on his left.
And the people passing by were cursing him as they were turning their heads.
And they said, "O you who will destroy the house of God and rebuild it in three days, come down from the cross if you are the son of God!" Matthew
And the presidents of the religious men and the scholars of the law and the sheikhs, even they laugh at him and say:
"Others besides him were saved, but he could not save himself! If he is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him!"
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Behold, he trusted in God! Let him deliver him now, if he so desires, for he has said: I am the Son of God!\""
Even the criminals who were crucified with him reviled him like the others. The death of Jesus
Darkness fell over the entire country from noon until three in the afternoon.
And at three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice: "E إيلي, إيلي, lama sabachthani?" which means: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
And some of those who were standing there heard him and said, "He is calling for Elijah."
One of them ran and took a piece of cloth, soaked it in vinegar, put it on the head of a reed, and handed it to him to drink.
And the others said to him, "Wait until we see if Elijah will come to deliver him!"
And Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and died.
And the raw materials of God's House were divided in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rock split.
And the graves are sweet and you resurrected many holy people from the dead,
And they came out of the tombs after Jesus had been raised from the dead, and they entered Jerusalem the holy city, and they appeared to many people.
And when the chief of the army and the guards who were guarding Jesus with him saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were greatly terrified and said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God."
And many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, who had been helping him, were looking on from a distance. Luke
Those among them are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial of Jesus
In the evening, a wealthy man from Ramah named Joseph came. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
And this man went in and approached Governor Pilate, and requested him to give him the data of Jesus. And at that time, Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud,
And he put it in the new grave that he had dug in the rock, and he put a large stone at the door of the grave and walked away.
And behold, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
And on the morrow, that is to say, the day following that on which they prepared for the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate,
And they said to him: "Remember, sir, that the deceiver, when he was alive, used to say that after three days he would be resurrected." Mathew
So, give your order for there to be guarding of the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples don't come at night to steal him and tell the people: 'He has been raised from the dead!' And this last lie will be worse than the first one."
Here is the English translation of the provided text: And he says to them, Pilate: «You have guards, so go and guard the tomb as you want».
And they went and lit the chamber of the grave and kept guard around it.
Chapter twenty-eight. Jesus was resurrected from the dead.
And when the Sabbath was past, and it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.
Suddenly, a strong earthquake struck, for the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb and sat upon it.
His appearance was slim like lightning, and his clothing was white like snow.
And the guards were trembling with fear and became like the dead.
But the angel said to both women: "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here, because he was raised from the dead as he said. Come, see the place where he was laid.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He who was dead is now alive and will go ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' 'Go and tell them,' he said.
And the women hurried out of the grave, scared and very happy, and they went running to bring the news to his students.
While they were together, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" Then
And Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards reported these things that had happened.
And when the women were going away, some of the tomb guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
And they gathered with the elders and consulted about this, and they bribed the army with a lot of money,
And they said to them: "Tell them that his disciples came at night and stole him while we were sleeping."
Otherwise, the governor will hear the news. We are going to convince him, and nothing bad is going to happen to you.
And the guards took the money and did as they were instructed, and this news spread among the Jews until today. Jesus commissions his disciples
But the disciples, when they had assembled in Galilee, on the mountain where Jesus had directed them, according to Matthew.
And when they saw him, they prostrated to him, but some of them doubted.

Chapter 1: John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
A voice is crying out in the desert, saying, "Here I am, sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
And so John came to the desert baptizing people and telling them about the baptism of repentance so that God would forgive their sins. Seek out the path of the Lord, and they will lead His paths».
And all the people from the region of Judea and Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the River Jordan, while confessing their sins.
John the Baptist wore clothing made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he used to tell the people and say, "After me, someone will come who is stronger than me, and I am not worthy to stoop down even to loosen the laces of his sandals."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. John baptizes Jesus.
And in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And at that very hour, when he came out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.
And you hear a voice from the heavens saying: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 The Devil Tempts Jesus
And at that time, the Spirit of God Jesus went out into the desert.
And it came to pass that forty days were fulfilled, and the devil tempted him. And beasts were going around him, and angels were ministering unto him. Jesus preaches in Galilee.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus came to the Galilee region, proclaiming the good news of God,

And he said to them, Jesus: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And then they left their window and followed him.
And when He was already a little distance away, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in the boat mending their nets.
And Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee with the hired servants in the boat, and they followed him. Jesus heals a man possessed by a demon.
And they went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, Jesus went to the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like someone who had authority, not like the scholars of Islamic law.
And there was a man possessed by a jinn in the prayer house, and he started screaming.
And he says, "What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: you are the holy one of God!"
And Jesus rebuked the demon and said to him, "Be quiet and come out of the man!"

And Jesus said to the man who had the paralyzed hand, "Get up, stand in the center!"
And he said to the Pharisees: "What is it lawful to do on the Sabbath, to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" And they remained silent.
And he looked at them, angry, and he was very sad about the hardness of their hearts, and he said to the man: "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched out his hand, and it became sound.
And at that hour, the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against how to destroy him. Many people were following Jesus.
And Jesus went out with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed him from Galilee and Judea.
