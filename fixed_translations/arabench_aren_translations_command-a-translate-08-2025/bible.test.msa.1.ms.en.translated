Then Jesus called a little child to him and put him in the middle of them.
“Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”
ietietietietietietietietietietietietietietietietietietietietiet
And he that received one such little child in my name receiveth me.
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.

If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. The parable of the lost sheep
“See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.”
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that went astray?
And if it happens that he finds it, I tell you the truth: he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
So it is not your Father’s will who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
And if he will not hear them, take with you one or two more, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.”
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he began to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
And if he had nothing with which to repay his master, he would be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all that he possessed, and the debt would be repaid.
The servant’s pride made him prostrate himself before him, saying, “My lord, give me time, and I will pay you back everything.”
So the master of that slave had mercy on him and released him, and forgave him the debt.
But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe me.’
The slave was proud of his companion on his feet and asked him: Wait for me and I will pay you all.
He did not respond, but went on and threw him into prison until he paid the debt.
When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened.
And his lord called him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?
His master became angry and handed him over to the torturers, until he should pay back all he owed him.
This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”
Marriage and divorce
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
The Pharisees came to him to test him, saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?”
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
They said to him, “Why then did Moses command that a certificate of divorce be given and that she be dismissed?”
He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of a man with a woman, it is not expedient to marry.”
He said to them, “Not everyone accepts this teaching, but only those to whom it is given.
For there are eunuchs who have been born so from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.” Jesus blesses the children
Then children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
And having laid his hands on them, he departed from there. The Rich Young Man
And one came up and said to him, “Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”
He said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, that is God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
He said to him, “Which commandments?” Jesus said, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not give false testimony.
Honour thy father and thy mother, and love thy neighbour as thyself.
The young man said to him, “I have kept all these since my youth. What do I still lack?”
Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”
Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Peter answered him, “Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?”
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And whoever has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
Like servants in a vineyard
“For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard;
He agreed with the workers on a dinar per day and sent them to his vineyard.
Then he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
He said to them, “You also go to the vineyard, and I will give you what is right.” And they went.
He also went out at the sixth and ninth hours and did likewise.
Then, at about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing idle, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’
They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go too, into the vineyard, and you will receive what is due to you.’
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’
And those who came at the eleventh hour received a denarius each.
When the first ones came, they thought they would get more. So they too took one dinar each.
And as they took it, they murmured against the master of the house.
They said, “These people have worked for only one hour, yet you have equated them with us, even though we bore the burden of the day and its heat!”
He replied to one of them, “Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius?”
Take what is yours and go; but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.
Or is it lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Thus the last will be first, and the first will be last; for many are called, but few are chosen.” Jesus foretells his death and resurrection
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
and deliver him to the nations to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.” The request of the sons of Zebedee's mother
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, and kneeling before him, she asked a favor of him.
He said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Order that these two sons of mine will sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom.”
Jesus answered, “You don’t know what you’re asking. Can you drink the cup that I’m going to drink? Can you be baptized with the baptism that I’m going to be baptized with?” They said to him, “We can.”
He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but to be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, this is not for me to grant—except to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
When the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers.
Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
Let it not be so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant,
And whoever among you wants to be first, let him be your slave.
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Healing the two blind men at Jericho
And as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
But the crowd rebuked them and told them to be silent; but they cried out all the more, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!”
And Jesus stood still and called them, and said: What do you want me to do for you?
They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened!”
And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed him.
Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
And if anyone says anything to you, say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ And he will send them here immediately.”
All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet,
Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.”
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
And they brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they sat thereon.
And most of the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And the crowds that went before him and that followed him shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?”
The crowd said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." The cleansing of the temple
And Jesus entered the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves.
And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers.”
And my uncle came to him and limped in the temple, and he healed them.
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant;
And they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself’?”
Then he left them, went out of the city, into Bethany, and lodged there. The fig tree withered away.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
And seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.
Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.
And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.” The question about Jesus’ authority
And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”
Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, and if ye tell me that, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:
The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
And if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the people, for all regard John as a prophet.”
They answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” He said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons
“What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’
He answered and said, “What I want.” But he regretted it in the end and went away.
And he came to the second and said the same thing. And he answered and said, 'I am here, Lord.' And he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said to him, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. The parable of the husbandmen.
Listen to another example: A man, a householder, planted a vineyard, fenced it in, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and leased it to tenants, then went on a journey.
And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruits.
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Then he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did the same to them.
Finally he sent his son to them, saying: They fear my son!
But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!’
So they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
“So when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”
They said to him, “Those wretches deserve a wretched death, and the vineyard should be given to other farmers who will give it its fruit at harvest time.”
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
And whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them.
And they sought to arrest him, but they feared the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet.
Like the wedding of the king's son
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
And he sent out other servants also, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited: Look, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet!’
But they turned away and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,
And the rest laid hold on his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
When the king heard this, he was angry, and he sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned down their city.
Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy.’
So go to the street corners and invite to the wedding anyone you find.
So those servants went out into the roads and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.
But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment.
Then He said to him, “Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?” And he was speechless.
Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.’
For many are called, but few are chosen.” Render unto Caesar
Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and care for no one; for you do not regard the position of men.
So tell us: What do you think? Is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
Jesus knew their wickedness and said, “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?”
“Show me the jizya tax receipt.” They gave him a dinar.
He said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?”
They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away. The question about the resurrection of the dead
On that day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him
saying, “Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies childless, his brother shall marry the woman and raise up offspring for his brother.
We had seven brothers, the first one got married and died. Since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second, the third, up to the seventh.
And finally, the woman died too.
At the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, for she was married to all of them?
Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The Greatest Commandment
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.
“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Christ and David
And as the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
He said to them, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said, “The son of David.”
He said to them, “How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls Him ‘Lord,’ saying,
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
For if David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a word. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him anything.
Warning against scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples
For on Moses’ seat sit the scribes and Pharisees,
Whatever they bid you to observe, observe and do it. But do not act according to their deeds, for they say things but do not do them.
And they place on the shoulders of people burdens that are difficult to bear, and they do not wish to move them even with a finger.
And all their works they do to be seen by men; and they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments.
And they love the foremost place at feasts, and the foremost seats in assemblies.
and greetings in the markets, and that people should call them: ‘Master! Master!’
But you, do not be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, the Christ, and you are all brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you will be your servant.
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees!
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Woe unto you, ye blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
And whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering upon it, he is bound.
You blind fools! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
Whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the One seated on it.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
You blind leaders! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside of it may also be clean.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
So you too are outwardly righteous to men, but inwardly full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and garnish the tombs of the righteous,
And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have joined them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
You yourselves bear witness that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets.
Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
You snakes, you offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
Truly, I say to you, all the righteous blood shed on earth will come upon you, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
Truly I say to you, all this will come upon this generation. Jesus laments over Jerusalem
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’”
Signs of the end of time
Then Jesus went out of the temple and was going away, when His disciples came to point out to Him the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said to them, “Do you see all these? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another that will not be torn down.”
And as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered and said to them, “See to it that no one misleads you.
For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
But these are all just the beginning of the pains.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you. You will be hated by all nations because of my name.
And then many will stumble and betray one another and hate one another.
And many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall grow cold.
But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
“So when you see the ‘abomination of desolation’ spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place” (let the reader understand),
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
And he who is on the roof must not come down to take anything out of his house.
And he who is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.
Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
Pray that your flight will not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.
And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.
If anyone says to you then, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.
For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
There, I have told you beforehand.
If they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the wilderness!’ do not go forth. ‘Look, He is in the inner rooms!’ Do not believe it.
For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branches become tender and it puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
So also you, when you see all these things, know that He is near, even at the doors.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.
The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Always be prepared.
But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Then there shall be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour when your Lord is coming.
And know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man comes at an hour you do not expect. Who then is a faithful and wise servant?
Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
Verily I say unto you, He hath made him ruler over all his goods.
But if that wicked servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’
He begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards.
The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know.
and I will cut him off and assign him his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth.
Like the ten virgins
Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
But the foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them.
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
And as the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
At midnight there was a cry, ‘Look, here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
Then the foolish virgins said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’
The wise women answered, saying, If he be worthy, let him give us also: but if not, let them go themselves and buy.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.
Finally the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us!’
He answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming. The Parable of the Talents
“It is as if a man, about to go on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them;
So he gave one five talents, another two, and another one, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
So he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
And he who received the two talents also gained two more.
But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.
And after a long time the master of those servants came and reckoned with them.
Then he who had received the five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.’
His master said to him, “Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”
Then he who had received the two talents came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents besides them.’
His master said to him, “Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.”
Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,
So I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here is what is yours.
His master replied, “You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
You should have invested my silver with the bankers, and when I returned, I would have received my own with interest.
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Sheep and goats
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
And all the peoples will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in.
I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.
The righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?’
And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?
And when did we see you ill or in prison and visit you?
Then the king will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.’
Then He will also say to those on the left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I was hungry and you gave me no food; I was thirsty and you gave me no drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me. Naked and you did not clothe me. Sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?
He will answer them, “Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.”
And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
Plot to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
And they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.” The anointing of Jesus with perfume
And as Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume and poured it on his head while he was reclining at the table.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked.
For this perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”
Jesus learned of this and said to them, “Why do you bother this woman? She has performed a good service for me.”
For ye have the poor with you always, but me ye have not always.
For she poured this perfume on my body beforehand, to prepare me for burial.
Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her." The betrayal of Judas
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
And he said, “What will you give me that I may deliver him over to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time he sought an opportunity to betray him. The Passover meal with the disciples
Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is near; at your house I shall keep the Passover with my disciples.’”
Then the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
And in the evening he reclined at table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, “Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.”
So they were very sorrowful, and each of them began to say to him, “Lord, is it I?”
He answered and said, “He who dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray Me.”
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said: “Is it I, Lord?” He said to him, “You have said it.” The Lord’s Supper
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
And he took the cup, gave thanks and said, “Drink from it, all of you.”
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
And I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
Then they swam and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts Peter's denial of him
Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will fall away because of me this night. For it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
But I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter answered him, “Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet I will never be offended.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”
Peter said to him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.” All the disciples said the same. In Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”
Then he took Peter, James, and John with him, and began to feel sorrow and distress.
Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
Then he went a little farther and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will.”
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “So, could you not keep watch with me for one hour?
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And he went away again a second time, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Then he came to them, but they were asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
Then He left them and went away once again and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, “Sleep and rest now! Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
"Let us go! Behold, he who betrays me is near." The arrest of Jesus
And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he that delivered him up gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
And he came and said to Jesus, “Hail, Master!” and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, “Friend, why have you come?” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
Then one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Do you think that I cannot now ask my father to send me more than twelve armies of angels?
How then does Scripture complete it? It says that it must be so.
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.
All this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled. Before the Jewish Council
Then those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
The chief priests and the elders and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death,
They did not find him. And although many false witnesses came, they did not find him. But at last two false witnesses came forward.
They said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.’”
Then the high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is it that these men testify against you?”
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said to him, “I charge you under oath before the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
“What do you see?” they asked. They replied, “He deserves to die.”
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
saying, "Prophet, who hit you?" The denial of Peter
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”
But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are saying.”
Then, when he went out to the porch, another servant saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!”
And he also denied it under oath: “I do not know the man!”
And after a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.”
Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself
Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death;
Then they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Then Judas, who had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, was repentant, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
saying, “I have sinned by handing over innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? You deal with it!”
He threw the silver into the temple and left, then went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, because it is blood money.”
So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
That is why the field is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom certain sons of Israel priced,
And give it for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.” Before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And Jesus said to him, “You say so.”
And while the chief priests and the elders were accusing him, he answered nothing.
Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they are testifying against you?”
He did not answer him a single word, which greatly surprised the governor.
On the feast day, the governor used to release one prisoner to the crowd, whoever they wanted.
They had a notorious prisoner at that time called Barabbas.
While they were assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”
For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.
And as he sat on the throne, his wife sent to him, saying, “Beware of that man, for today I suffered greatly in a dream because of him.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
The governor answered and said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” They said, “Barabbas!”
Pilate said to them, “So what shall I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”
The governor said, “What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.
And all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children.”
Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and handed over to be crucified. Mocking by the soldiers
Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace and gathered the whole company around him.
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
And they plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
Then, after they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to be crucified. Crucifixion
And as they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull,
They gave him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. And when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots, so that what was said by the prophet might be fulfilled: “They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.”
Then they sat there guarding him.
And over his head they put up the reason for his punishment, written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
And the passers-by would row against him, shaking their heads.
saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
And the chief priests also mocked him with the scribes and elders, saying,
He saves others, but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He put his trust in God. Let Him deliver him now if He wants him, for he said, “I am the Son of God.”
And the thieves who were crucified with Him also reviled Him in the same way. Death
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
At about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
And some of those who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
But the rest said, “Leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him!”
So Jesus also cried out with a loud voice and gave up His spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split,
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose.
And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection, and entered the holy city and appeared to many.
Now the centurion, and those who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!”
And many women were watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving Him,
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial
Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
Then he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
and laid him in a new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb
And the next day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate.
saying, “Master, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
So they went and made the tomb secure until the third day, lest his disciples should come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead’, and the last deception would be worse than the first.”
Then Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go and make it as secure as you can.”
And they went and secured the tomb with guards and sealed the stone.
Resurrection
And after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre.
And there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and His garment was white as snow.
Then the guards trembled for fear of him, and became like dead men.
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and now he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ That is what I had to tell you.”
So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.
As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.” The guards’ report
And as they went, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all that had happened.
So they consulted with the elders and took counsel, and gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers.
saying, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’
And if the governor hears of this, we will appeal to him and make you feel safe.”
So they took the money and did as they were instructed. This saying has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to the disciples
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Amen.
John the Baptist prepares the way
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
A voice cries out in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
Then the whole region of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he preached, saying, “One who is stronger than I comes after me, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his sandals.
I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus Christ
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”
And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild beasts. And the angels ministered to him. The calling of the first disciples
And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.
He says, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near; repent and believe in the gospel.”
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
At once they left their nets and followed him.
And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
So he called them at once. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. He cast out an unclean spirit
Then they came to Capernaum; and when he entered the synagogue on the sabbath and began to teach,
They were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out
saying, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.”
Then Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”
And the unclean spirit convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”
And immediately his fame spread everywhere into all the region round about Galilee. The healing of Simon's mother-in-law and others
And when they came out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once.
So he went up to her, took her by the hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
When evening came, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
And the whole city was gathered at the gate.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who He was. Ministry in Galilee
And rising very early in the morning, he left and went into a desolate place, and there he prayed.
So Simon and his companions followed him.
And when they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. Healing of a leper
And a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”
Jesus took pity on him, and touched him, and said: “I will; be made clean.”
And as he was speaking, the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
So he rebuked him and sent him away at once.
And He said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
He went out, and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news around, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in deserted places; and they came to him from every quarter.
Healing a paralytic
And after some days he entered Capernaum again, and it was heard that he was in a house.
And immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and he was speaking the word to them.
And they came to him bringing a paralytic carried by four men.
When they could not reach him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof above him. After tearing it open, they lowered the mat on which the paralytic lay.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts:
“Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Jesus immediately knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he asked, “Why are you thinking these things?”
Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralytic—
I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go to your home.”
And immediately he rose up, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. The calling of Levi
Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.
And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.
And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
When the scribes and Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “The healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” The question about fasting
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they came and said unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.”
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine would burst the wineskins, and the wine will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.” The Lord of the Sabbath.
And he went through the cornfields on the Sabbath; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?”
How did he enter the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and give it also to those who were with him?”
Then He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
“The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.”
Healing on the Sabbath
Then He went into the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
So they were watching him to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him.
And he said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up in the midst!”
Then He said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to kill?” But they were silent.
Then He looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.
And the Pharisees went out, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, to destroy him. And the multitude followed him.
And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they which were about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
He said to His disciples, “Let a small boat accompany Me because of the crowd, so that they do not crush Me.”
For he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.
When the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”
And he charged them to tell no one about him. The choice of the twelve apostles
Then He went up on the mountain and called those whom He wanted, and they came to Him.
And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
And they shall have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.
And he gave Simon the name Peter.
And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Then they came to a house. Jesus and Beelzebul
And the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”
But the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.”
And he called them to him and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?”
