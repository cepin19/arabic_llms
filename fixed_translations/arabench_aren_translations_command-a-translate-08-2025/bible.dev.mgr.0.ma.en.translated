This is the record of the ancestors of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David and of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Aram,
And Aram fathered Aminadab, and Aminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
Jesse fathered King David. David fathered Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah’s wife.
And Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia begat Asa,
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah;
And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amos, and Amos begat Josiah,
Jeconiah and his brothers were born during the Babylonian exile of the Jews, when Josiah was their father.
And after the Jews returned from Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,
Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the son of Jeconiah, and Jeconiah the son of Azor,
And Azur begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
And this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Luke
Her fiancé, Youssef, was a God-fearing man who did not want to shame her, and decided to secretly break up with her.
And while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child she carries was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.”
She will give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” Luke
And all this happened so that the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet would be fulfilled:
“Look, the virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Immanuel”—which means, “God with us.”
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter Two The astrologers came to see Jesus.
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
“Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.” (Matthew 2:2)
When King Herod heard this, he and all Jerusalem with him were frightened.
Then he gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, and asked them, “Where will the Christ be born?”
And they answered him: “Bethlehem in Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote when he said:
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.”
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
After that he sent them to Bethlehem and said to them: “Go and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come and tell me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came to the place where the child was, and it stood still above it.
When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
And when they entered the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they knelt down and worshipped him, and opened their chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
After the wise men were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they took another route and returned to their own country. Jesus' family flees to Egypt.
After the wise men had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
And Joseph arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt.
He remained there until the death of Herod, so that the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son." Herod killed the little children.
When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious and gave orders to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
Thus the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.” The family of Jesus returns from Egypt.
After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
Then he said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”
And Joseph arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.” Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter Three John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus
And in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
And he said to them, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” Matthew
This is the man spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. He lived on locusts and wild honey.
And people came to him from Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan.
And they crossed the Jordan with him, and they confessed their sins.
When John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Matthew
Prove your repentance with your good deeds, Ewa Benou.
And don’t start saying to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. John
Now the axe is laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
I will baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, and I am not worthy to take off his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And his winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” John baptizes Jesus.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
Jesus answered him, “Allow it for now, because this is how we must fulfill God’s will.” Then John allowed him to be baptized.
And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Matthew 3:17; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter 4 The devil tempts Jesus
Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil. Hebrews
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and then hunger came to him.
Then the devil, who tempts, came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
Jesus answered him, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from God.’”
Then Satan took him to the holy city of Jerusalem and placed him on a high point above God’s house,
He said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the Book of God: ‘God will command his angels to protect you, and they will carry you in their hands so that your foot does not strike a stone.’”
Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
Then Satan took him up to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he said to him, “I will give you all this if you bow down and worship me.”
Jesus answered him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’”
And after that, Satan left him, and angels came and ministered to him. Jesus preaches in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. Matthew
And Nazareth was deserted, and he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
And so what the prophet Isaiah had said was fulfilled:
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
The people who were sitting in darkness saw a great light, and those who lived in the land of death, a light shone upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
Then they left their nets and followed him.
After that, he went from there and saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee and his brother John, with their father Zebedee in a boat, mending their nets. And he called them.
And they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus was teaching and healing.
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. Matthew
And the news about him spread throughout Syria, and they brought to him all the sick who were suffering from various diseases: the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
And many people followed him from Galilee, including the ten disciples, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
Chapter Five Jesus' Sermon on the Mount
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him.
And He began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who cry, for God will comfort them.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for obedience to God, for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy from God.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Blessed are those who help people live in peace, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 1 Peter 3:14
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 1 Peter 4:14
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.” Acts 7:52 The salt of the earth and the light of the world.
“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34, 35
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. John
No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather puts it in its place, so that it may shed light on all who are in the house. Mark
In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” 1 Peter 2:12 Law
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.”
And I tell you the truth: Heaven and earth will pass away, but not a single letter or stroke of a letter will pass from the law until everything is accomplished. Luke
Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
And I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. The Sermon
You have surely heard that it was said to the ancients: Do not kill, and whoever kills shall be judged.
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Otherwise, you would have brought your gift and placed it on the altar, and then you would have remembered that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go. First make peace with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
Reconcile with the person who is suing you while you are still on your way to court, before he hands you over to the judge, and the judge hands you over to the police, and the police put you in jail.
I’m telling you the truth: you won’t get out of there until you pay the last penny you owe. Corruption
And you’ve heard what they say: don’t ruin it.
But I say to you, whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Otherwise, if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you, for it is better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell. When?
Otherwise, your right hand will lead you to sin, so cut it off and throw it away, because it is better to lose a part of yourself than to have your whole body thrown into hell." Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
And he said again: Whoever divorces his wife must give her her dues. When?
But I say to you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than immorality causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11 Oath
And again you have heard what was said to your ancestors: ‘Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’
But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: not by heaven, because it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, because it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
Neither by the earth, for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
And don’t swear by your head either, because you can’t change a single hair on it, whether it’s black or white.
But if you have something to say, say: yes. And if not, say: no. Any words beyond this are from the devil.” Revenge
You have heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if someone wants to sue you in court to take your djellaba, leave him your buttons too.
If there is one thing that forces you to take a thousand steps with him, take two thousand.
And if someone asks you for something, give it to him, and if someone wants to borrow from you, don’t send him away empty-handed.” Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said: Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you.
So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
But if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?
Otherwise, you will only hand over your brothers alone. How are you better than others? Isn't it true that even idol worshippers do the same?
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Chapter VI Alms-giving
“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. Matthew
And if you give alms, do not proclaim it before people, as the hypocrites do in the houses of worship and in the streets, so that they may be praised by people. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward from people.
But when you give to the needy, be sure that your left hand does not know what your right hand is doing,
So that your almsgiving remains secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. Luke
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
So don’t be like them, because your Father in heaven knows what you need before you ask him.
And this is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, may your name be sanctified,
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
The bread that is enough for us is our sustenance for today.
And forgive us our sins, just as we forgive those who sin against us.
And protect us from falling into temptation, and save us from the devil.
For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins.” Fasting
But when you fast, do not look sullen like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But you are fasting, so oil your hair and wash your face.
It’s not for people who need to see you fasting that you fast, but for your father who is in secret, and your father who knows everything and will reward you. Treasures in heaven.
“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. Jacob
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not dig through nor steal.
“Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” Noor Al-Dat
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” God and money
No one can be a slave to two masters, because either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot be slaves of God and of money in the same way. Do not worry.
That is why I tell you: Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?
Look at the birds of the sky: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you, if he takes on a burden, can add even an hour to his life?
Why do you worry about clothes? Look at the flowers in the field and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin.
But I tell you the truth: not even Solomon in all his glory was ever dressed like one of these flowers.
O you of little faith! If the spring in the field, which we see today and which is thrown into the oven tomorrow, is dressed by God in this way, how much better will He dress you?
And because of this, don’t worry and ask yourself: what are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
Even those who do not know God ask for all this, and your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.
But first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Don’t add to your worries for the next day, leave tomorrow’s worries for tomorrow. Each day has enough worries of its own.
Chapter Seven Don't judge anyone
Do not judge anyone, so that you will not be judged.
Judge, and you will be judged by the same standard; use the same measure, and it will be used for you. Mark
Why do you see the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
Or how are you going to tell your brother, let me remove the straw from your eye, when you have a stick in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first remove the log from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck of straw from your brother's eye.
Do not give the sacred thing to dogs, lest they turn on you and tear you apart, and do not throw your jewels to pigs, lest they trample them under their feet. Ask, search and knock.
Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened to you.
Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
And if a whale asks him for something, will he give it to a snake?
Ewa, if you who are bad people know how to give good things to your children, how come your father in heaven does not give good things to those who ask him?
Do to others as you would have them do to you, for this is the essence of the law and the teachings of the prophets. Luke 6:31 The Narrow Gate
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
How narrow is the door and how difficult is the road that leads to life, and few are those who find it. The tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. Can you pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
“By their fruit you will recognize them.” Matthew 12:33 We must do God's will.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
May the day be sacrificed for you. Many will say to me: Sir, sir! Is it not in your name that we prophesied? And in your name we cast out demons? And in your name we did many miracles?
At that time, I will say to them: I never knew you! Stay away from me, you sinners! The example of two houses
Whoever listens to my words and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on rock.
When the rain fell and the valleys overflowed, and a strong wind came and hit that house, it did not collapse, because its foundation was built on rock.
Whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And when the rain fell and the valleys overflowed, and a strong wind came and hit that house, it collapsed, and its rubble was strong.
And when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching. Mark
He taught them as if he had authority, not like their religious scholars.
Chapter 8 Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy
And when Jesus came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
And a leper came to him, knelt down before him, and said, “Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." The servant of the captain was healed.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, appealing to him
He said to him: "Sir, my servant at home is bedridden, paralysed and suffering a lot."
Jesus said to him, “I will go and heal him.”
The military commander replied: “I don’t deserve you to enter my house, sir, but just say one word and my servant will be healed.”
“Even I have people who rule me and I have an army that I rule. I tell this one: ‘Go!’ and he goes, and I tell the other one: ‘Come!’ and he comes, and I tell my slave: ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.”
But I tell you, many will come from the east and the west and will eat with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Luke
But those who were supposed to be in the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. When?
Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment. Jesus Heals Peter’s Mother-in-Law and Many Others
When Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, the fever left her, and she got up and served him.
And when evening came, they brought to him many who were possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
And so the words of the prophet Isaiah were fulfilled: “He took our sickness and bore our diseases.” How should those who follow Jesus be?
When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.
He called one of the religious scholars to him and said: "Sir, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
And another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
But Jesus answered him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” Jesus calms a storm
And when Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
And there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves; but Jesus was asleep.
And the students came close to him and woke him up and said to him: "Save us, sir, we're dying!"
He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
The men were amazed and said, “Who is this man that even the winds and the sea obey him?” Jesus drove the demons out of two men from Gadara.
When Jesus arrived on the other side of the sea, in the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were possessed by demons met him as he got out of the boat. They came from the tombs and were so fierce that no one could pass that way.
When they saw him, they began to complain and say, “What do we have to do with you, son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
There was a large herd of donkeys grazing in a nearby area.
And the devils begged Jesus, saying, “If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
He said to them: "Go!" And they went in, and the whole piece fell off the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank into the water.
And they let the pigs go and went into the city and told everything that had happened, and what had happened to the men who were possessed by demons.
And the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Chapter 9 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
And Jesus got into the boat and crossed the sea and came to his own city.
And they brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.”
Some religious scholars thought to themselves: "This man is uttering blasphemy!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why are you thinking these evil things in your hearts?”
As for Sahl, it is said: "Your sins are forgiven," and not: "Get up and go."
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, take your mat and go home.”
The man got up and went home.
And when the crowds saw what had happened, they were afraid, and glorified God who had given people such power. Jesus chose Matthew.
As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” So he arose and followed Him.
And afterwards Jesus sat down to eat in Matthew’s house, and many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with him and his disciples. Luke
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When Jesus heard this, he answered them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor, but sick people do.
Ewa Sirou, learn the meaning of these words: I want mercy, not slaughter, because I did not come to call on those who fear God, but on sinners. The question is about fasting.
Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus answered them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
And no one puts new wine into old leather wineskins, because if they do, the wineskins will burst and the wine will be lost, and the wineskins will be destroyed. But we put new wine into new leather wineskins, so that neither the wine nor the wineskins are lost.” The president’s daughter and the woman who touched Jesus’ clothes.
And when he told them this, a ruler came to him and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
And Jesus went forth, and his disciples followed him.
And there was a woman who had been sick for twelve years and was bleeding. She came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes.
She thought to herself, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”
Jesus turned around, saw her, and said, “Take heart, daughter, your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.
And when Jesus came to the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He told them: "Get out of here! The girl is not dead, she is just sleeping!", and they laughed at him.
And when he had put them all out, he took her by the hand, and called unto her, that she should arise.
And the news spread throughout that whole country. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him. “Do you believe that I am able to heal you?” Jesus asked them. “Yes, Lord,” they replied.
At that time, Jesus touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done to you.”
And they were amazed. And Jesus forbade them and said, “Do not tell anyone!”
But they went out and started spreading the news all over the place. Zizon is cured.
And when they were about to let the blind man out, they brought him a man who was a dwarf and possessed by madness.
And when the devil had gone out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marvelled, saying, “Never have we seen anything like this in Israel!”
But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons.” Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The trial of Jesus
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. Matthew
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Mark
He said to his disciples, "The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few." Luke
Ewa, they asked the owner of the harvest to send the harvesters to his harvest.
Chapter 10 Jesus sends out the twelve disciples
After this, Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to cure every disease and every sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus.
Jesus sent out these twelve and commanded them, saying: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter a Samaritan town,
But go to the lost sheep of the people of Israel.
As you go, proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, revive the dead, restore the lepers to purity, and cast out demons. You received it for free, so give it for free.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your pockets.
No bundle, no two clothes, no shoes, no staff, because the worker deserves his food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
And the city or the village you enter, ask for someone who deserves to host you, and stay with him until you leave.
And if you enter a house, greet its inhabitants.
Otherwise, the people of the house deserve your greetings, and your greetings will reach them. Otherwise, if they do not deserve it, your greetings will return to you.
Otherwise, the people of a house or a city would not have accepted you, nor would they have listened to your words. Leave that place and shake the dust off your feet. Deeds
I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town." Luke 10:4-12 The next race
"I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as cunning as serpents and as gentle as doves." Luke
Be careful of people, they will take you to court, and in their prayer houses they will beat you, Mark.
And they will bring you before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.
And when they hand it to you, don’t worry about how or what you’ll say, because you’ll be told what to say at that time.
For it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who is in heaven will give you what to say.
A brother will hand over his brother to be killed, and a father will hand over his child to be killed. Children will rise up against their parents and have them killed. Mark
And everyone will hate you because of my name. But whoever endures to the end will be saved. When
But if they persecute you in one town, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.”
A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. Luke
The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they call those of his household? Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Don’t be afraid of them, because everything that is hidden will be revealed, and everything that is secret will be made known. Mark
And so, whatever I told you at night, say it during the day. And whatever you heard in secret, spread it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Two birds are sold for one dirham! But none of them will fall to the ground unless your father in heaven wants it.
Even your hair is counted, you people.
Don’t worry, you’re better than a lot of birds.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven." 2 Timothy 2:12 It is not our God, but the sword.
“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”
I came to separate the son from his father, the daughter from her mother, and the bride from her mother-in-law.
And people’s enemies will become their own family members.
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Matthew
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.” Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:33; John 12:25 Reward
He who welcomes you welcomes me, and he who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Luke
Whoever welcomes a prophet because he knows he is a prophet will receive a reward like that of a prophet. Whoever welcomes a righteous person because he knows he is a righteous person will receive a reward like that of a righteous person.
“Anyone who gives one of these children even a glass of cold water because he is my student, I tell you the truth, he will not lose his reward.”
Chapter 13 John the Baptist sends his disciples to Jesus
And when Jesus had finished giving these commandments to his twelve disciples, he went away from there to teach and preach in the cities of the Jews.
When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him about it.
He said to him: “Is it you who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?”
Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see:
The blind can see, the lame can walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf can hear, the dead are raised, and the poor hear the good news.
“And happy is the one who doesn’t doubt it.”
And when John’s disciples had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
And what did you go out to see? Was it a man wearing fine clothes? Because those who wear fine clothes live in kings' palaces!
What did you go out to see? A prophet? I tell you, yes, he is a prophet and more than a prophet.
And this is what God said in His Book: I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare the way for you.
And I tell you the truth: among those born of women there has not been anyone greater than John the Baptist, but even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. Luke
And all the prophets prophesied according to the law of Moses until John the Baptist came.
If you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, who is to come. Matthew
Whoever has ears, let him hear!
But how would you describe this generation? It’s like children sitting in the market calling out to each other and laughing.
We inflated the lira for you and you didn’t dance, we wailed for you and you didn’t cry!
John went on his way, neither eating nor drinking, and they said: This man is possessed by a demon.
And the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they said, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is proved right by her actions.” Woe to the blogger who does not repent.
At that time, Jesus loved the bloggers among whom he performed more miracles than the other bloggers, because their people did not repent.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, and would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes. # 11:21 They wore sackcloth and sat in ashes: to show their repentance.
But I tell you: the punishment of a blogger who takes pictures and videos on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than yours.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
And I tell you this: On the day of judgment, Sodom will be treated less harshly than you.” Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 Come to me and rest.
At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.
Aye, aye, Father, this was your will.
The Father has given me everything, and no one knows who the Son of the Father is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son of the Father and anyone to whom the Son of the Father wants to reveal him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
“My yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
Chapter 14 Jesus teaches about the Sabbath
And it came to pass, that on the second sabbath after the first, he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, being hungry.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
He replied to them: "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"
And how he entered the house of God and ate the bread that was offered to God, which neither he nor those with him, except the clergy alone, were supposed to eat.
Haven’t you read in the Torah that the priests violate the Sabbath while serving in the house of God on the Sabbath, and they are not guilty of that?
But I tell you, there is something greater than the temple here.
If you understood the meaning of the verse that says: I want mercy, not sacrifice, you would not have judged those who are blameless.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” Jesus was teaching on the Sabbath.
He then walked to their place of worship.
He saw a man whose hand was paralysed. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” They asked him this in order to accuse him.
And he said to them, “Which of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?” Luke
Ewa, the value of a human being is much greater than that of a sheep! That’s why doing good is allowed on Saturdays.
Then Jesus said to the man with the paralysed hand, “Stretch out your hand!” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, as healthy as the other.
And the Pharisees went out and conspired how they might kill him. Jesus is the one chosen by God.
And when Jesus had finished speaking, he went away from there, and many people followed him, and he healed them all.
He told them not to tell anyone about it.
so that what the prophet Isaiah had said might come true:
Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He won’t fight and he won’t shout, no one will hear his voice in the streets.
A split reed will not break, and a wick that emits smoke will not extinguish, until justice prevails and becomes the victor.
For his name shall be the hope of the people.” Jesus and Beelzebub
And they brought to Jesus a man who was blind and dumb and possessed by a demon, and Jesus healed him, so that he could speak and see.
And the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.” Matthew 9:34; 10:25
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If it were the devil who cast out the devil, then the devil would have divided himself and turned against himself. And if he divided himself and turned against himself, how could his kingdom remain stable?
Otherwise, I would be like Beelzebub, driving out demons. So who is it that your children are being driven out by? That is why your children will judge you.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
And how can someone enter someone else’s house and steal their clothes without tying them up first, and then steal their house?
Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. Mark 9:40
That is why I tell you: People will be forgiven for every sin and every blasphemy they utter, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks a word against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to come." Luke 12:10 The tree and its fruit
“Plant a good tree and its fruit will be good, or plant a bad tree and its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit. When?
Oh, you snake charmer! How can you say something good when you are not good yourself? What comes from the heart is what the mouth speaks. When?
A good person brings forth good things from the good treasure of his heart, and an evil person brings forth evil things from the evil treasure of his heart.
And I tell you: all the empty talk people say, they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Judgment.
Because it is by your words that you will be judged, either as innocent or as guilty.” The scholars of the law and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.” Matthew
And he said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign! And no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Matthew
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now something greater than Solomon is here.
The national road that expels the jinn from humans goes around places without water, looking for peace and not finding it.
And he says: Let me go back to the house I left, and he goes back and finds it empty, clean and tidy.
And he walks and takes with him seven other demons worse than him. And when they enter and settle there, the condition of that person becomes worse than his initial condition. This is what will happen to this generation that also does evil.” The brothers of Jesus and his mother
And when he was talking to groups of people, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. [
One of the attendees said to him: "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to talk to you." # 12:47 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
Jesus answered him and said, “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?”
He pointed with his hand towards his students and said: “These are my mother and my brothers.”
“Those who do what my Murad does in heaven are my brother, my sister and my mother.”
Chapter 19: The Story of the Farmer
And in the morning, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
And many people gathered around him, and he got into a boat and sat down. And all the people stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
He then gave them many things with the mattock and said: “There was a man who went out to sow,
And as he was sowing, some seeds fell on the road, and the birds came and ate them.
Other seeds fell on rocky ground where there was little soil, and they sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep.
And when the sun rose, they burned, and since they had no walls, they dried up.
Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
“Whoever has ears, let them hear!” The purpose of the Mutawalli
And the disciples came to him and said, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
He answered them, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
For he who has, to him shall be given, and he will have more abundantly. But from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. When?
And I was talking to them in the language of the dead because when they see, they don’t see, and when they hear, they don’t hear and they don’t understand.
And so the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in them: “Though you hear, you will not understand, and though you see, you will not perceive.”
For the heart of this people has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. Luke
And I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it." The meaning of the parable of the sower.
Listen and understand the meaning of the parable of the man who sows.
Whoever hears the word of the kingdom of God but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one sown along the path.
And he who sows in stony ground, this is the one who hears God’s word and accepts it immediately with joy.
But God’s word did not take root in his heart, and his faith lasted only a short time. When trouble or persecution came because of the word, he quickly fell away.
And the one planted among thorns is the one who hears the word of God, but the worries of this world and the love of money choke the word in him and it bears no fruit.
But the one planted in good soil is the one who hears and understands God's word and bears fruit, sometimes a hundredfold, sometimes sixtyfold, and sometimes thirtyfold." The parable of the tares among the wheat.
Jesus gave them another example and said, “The Kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And while the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
When the crop sprouted and put forth ears, then the tares appeared as well.
And the servants of the owner of the house came to him and said: Sir, isn’t it good seed that you sowed in your field? Where then did this darnel come from?
He answers them: It’s an enemy who did this. And his employees say to him: Do you want us to go and remove it?
He answered them and said: No! So that the wheat is not mixed with the tares.
Let the wheat grow with the weeds until harvest time, and then we will tell the harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them into bundles to be burned, but the wheat will be gathered and brought to my storehouse." The parable of the mustard seed and the parable of the yeast.
He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
“Even though it is the smallest of all loves, when it grows up it becomes a tree bigger than all the other plants, even the birds of the sky come to nest in its branches.”
He gave them another example and said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough was leavened." Jesus speaks in parables.
And Jesus said all this to the crowds in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So that the words of the Prophet may come true: "Through the grain, we speak and tell of everything that has been hidden since the day the world was created." The meaning of the example of the grain
Then Jesus left the crowds and went home. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
He answered and said, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world, the good grain is the children of the kingdom of God, and the weeds are the children of the devil.
The enemy who sowed the tares is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are the angels.
But as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of this world.
The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers,
They throw them into the fire pit, that's where the crying and gnashing of teeth will be.
But those who obey God will shine like the sun in their Father’s kingdom. So if you have ears, listen!” The parable of the treasure, the pearl and the net.
“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
And when he found a very precious jewel, he went and sold everything he owned and bought it.
“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
When it was full, the fishermen took it to the seaside, sat down and started sorting. They put the good ones in baskets and threw away the ones that were no good.
And so it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the sinners from those who fear God.
They throw the guilty into a pit of fire, then there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The new and old treasure
Jesus asked his disciples, “Do you understand all this?” They answered, “Yes.”
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." Nazareth did not accept Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there.
And he returned to Nazareth, his hometown, and taught the people in their synagogues, and they were amazed and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?”
Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
Isn’t it true that all his sisters live in our city? So where did all this come from?”
They did not like it, but Jesus said to them, “A prophet is respected everywhere except in his own country and among his relatives.” John 4:44
And not many miracles were done there, because they had no faith.
Chapter 14 The Death of John the Baptist
And time was lost; the ruler Herod heard about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead, and that is why miracles are performed through him.”
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. Luke
Because John used to tell him: “It’s not right for you to marry her.”
He wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people, because they believed he was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday party, the daughter of Herodias danced at the party and pleased Herod.
And that’s why he swore to give her what she asked for.
And whatever she told him to do, she said to Herod, “Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter right now!”
The king was sad, but because of the oath he had sworn and the people who were present, he ordered that she be given what she wanted.
And he sent someone to cut off John’s head in prison.
They brought it in a plate and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.
And John’s disciples came, took up his body, and buried it. They went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand
When Jesus heard this, he left that place in a boat and went to a deserted place by himself. But the crowds found out about it and followed him on foot from the towns.
When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd, had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
And when evening came, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and the hour is now late; tell the crowds to go into the villages to buy food for themselves.”
But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
And they said to him, “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
He said to them, "Bring them to me here!"
He told the people to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and thanked God. He broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, and the disciples gave it to the people.
And they all ate until they were full, and then they collected twelve baskets full of leftover bread.
And those were the ones who ate about five thousand, besides women and children. Jesus walks on water.
And Jesus told his disciples to get into the boat immediately and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
And when he had sent them away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. And he was there alone until evening.
After the students' boat drifted far out to sea, the waves overwhelmed it because the wind was against it.
And in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples as he was walking on the water.
When the students saw him walking on the water, they were frightened and said, "This is the ghost of a jinn," and they screamed out of fear.
At that moment Jesus spoke to them, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
Then Peter said to him, “Lord, if it’s you, tell me to come to you walking on the water.”
And Jesus said to him, “Come!” So Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he got scared and started to drown, and he shouted and said: "Save me, Sir!"
Then Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And when they got on the felucca, the wind calmed down.
And those in the boat knelt before him and said, "Truly, you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many sick people in Gennesaret.
When Jesus and his disciples had crossed to the other side of the lake, they landed in the region of Gennesaret.
The people of that country knew him, and they spread his news throughout the region, and they brought him all their sick.
They asked him to touch them, even if it was just his clothes. And whoever touched him was healed.
Chapter 15 Discussions on the tradition of the elders
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
"Why don't your students follow the tradition of the elders? Because they don't wash their hands before eating."
But he answered them, “Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition?
God says: Take care of your father and mother, and anyone who curses his father or mother should be killed.
But we say to him: whoever says to his father or mother: the thing I should help you with, I have given it as a gift to God,
He is no longer obliged to take care of his father. And so you have abandoned God's word in order to follow your tradition.
O ye hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
These people only praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
And it is useless to worship me, because they teach doctrines that are only human commandments.” The things that corrupt people
And he called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand:
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, that defiles him.
Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
He answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.”
Leave them alone! They are blind guides. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” Luke
Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.”
He replies to him: “Don’t you still understand anything either?”
Don’t you know that everything that goes into a person’s mouth goes into their stomach and then comes out?
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and that is what defiles a person. When
For it is from the heart that evil thoughts come: murder, adultery, both of the married and unmarried, theft, false witness, and slander.
And that’s what makes people impure, but eating with unwashed hands does not make people impure.” The faith of the Canaanite woman
And Jesus went out from thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
Then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon possession.”
But he didn’t even answer her. Some students came up to him and asked him, saying, “Send her away, because she’s following us and shouting!”
Jesus answered them, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
But then that woman came and bowed down to him and said, “Help me, sir!”
He answered her and said: “It’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
The woman said to him: “Yes, sir! But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ tables.”
Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Many people were healed.
Then Jesus went from there to the side of the Sea of Galilee, climbed the mountain and sat there.
Then large crowds came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed when they saw the dumb speaking, the lame walking, the cripples healed, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds four thousand people.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”
And the disciples said to him, “Where shall we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed so great a crowd?”
Jesus asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They answered, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
Jesus orders the crowd to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
And they all ate until they were full, and they took up seven baskets full of the leftover pieces of bread.
And there were four thousand people who ate, besides women and children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a boat and came to the borders of Magdala.
Chapter 15: Signs of the Times
Then some Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
And in the early morning they would say: It will rain today, because the sky is red and cloudy. You know how to interpret the weather, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times!
An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he
When the students reached the other side of the sea, they forgot to take the bread with them.
Jesus said to them, “Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Luke
And they say to themselves: “He’s saying this because we didn’t bring bread with us.”
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why are you thinking to yourselves, you people of little faith, that you have no bread?”
Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you remember the five loaves of bread that were distributed to five thousand people, and how many baskets of bread crumbs you collected? When?
And do you not remember the seven loaves that were distributed to four thousand people, and how many baskets you collected? When?
How could you not understand that I was not talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”
At that point his disciples understood that he had been warning them to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, and not of the yeast in bread. Peter declared that Jesus was the Messiah.
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
And they answered him, saying, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. Matthew
And he asked them, “Who do you think I am in your opinion?”
Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!” John
Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
And I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the power of death will not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” Matthew
Then Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus predicts his death and resurrection.
From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you!”
He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”
And Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross and follow me, Matthew
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. When?
What good is it for a person to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their life? And what can anyone give in exchange for their life?
For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. Matthew
And I tell you the truth, some of you standing here will not die until you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
Chapter 17 Jesus appears in his glory
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart.
And his form changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white, shining like light.
And it appeared to them that Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I have taken great delight. Listen to him!” —2 Peter 1:17, 18
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
Then Jesus approached them and touched them, saying, “Get up! Don’t be afraid!”
And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus alone.
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Tell no one what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
And his disciples asked him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
He answered them and said: "In fact, Ilya Jijji is the first and he will fix everything."
But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.” Matthew
At that moment the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy possessed by a demon.
When Jesus and his disciples came to the crowd, a man came to him and knelt down before him.
He said: "Have mercy on my son, sir, because he has the wind and suffers a lot, and many times he falls into the fire and into the water."
He was your student and they couldn’t cure him.
Jesus answered, “You unbelieving generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me here.”
And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”
He said to them, “Because of your little faith! For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here
And this kind of madness can only be cured by prayer and fasting.”] # 17.21 This verse is not found in many old manuscripts. Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthiansädädädädädädädädädädädä
The disciples were in Galilee, and Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will be sent away.” The students were very sad. Jesus pays the temple tax
When Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum, the temple tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, “Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?”
He answered them, “Yes, he pays it.” When he came into the house, Jesus preceded him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive
Peter answered him, “From foreigners.” Jesus said to him, “Then the children are exempt from the tax.”
But so as not to cause them any trouble, go to the sea and cast your line. The first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you will find four dirhams in it. Take them and go pay for yourself and me.
