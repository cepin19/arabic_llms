I’m saying things that you don’t want to understand, Saleh.
Any problems? Salih is open. Open your mind. Open the world around you. Open the people. What are you doing? Open the world. What are you doing?
my uncle's brother
And he wants to develop himself and those around him.
Oh Saleh, don’t be stubborn.
No, no, no, no, I don’t care about you.
And walk on the road
And pass two cut dates through the root
And you are a dead man, Malio.
Eat or don't eat
No eating
Okay, human, I agree.
I don’t know where this guy lives
I couldn’t stand him.
This is our chance, our cars are old and their models are embarrassing.
Try it, you try it with him in a little while, for God’s sake.
These are normal and well-known things.
The bull is the only one who has no personality.
Yes, he is afraid.
I’m the one who’s pissing you off, mom.
The budget is in his hands.
What is this project that he is holding?
A government project
infrastructure and what appears
I have the right to take
You are in a ministry and he is in another ministry.
Oh my God, Mom, you forgot.
A day in the garage
That means I
I consider myself a contributor with them.
It’s not possible, I can’t get anything out of this project. Wow!
It’s none of my business.
That means I am also a contributor.
We are all supposed to take
This is a government project
He finally understands that your son is a fool.
I understand him.
Good things are coming, you will kick them away.
This is a government project.
And this is your chance
It’s like your gear doesn’t fit.
The tray of goodness is in front of you.
Take your bite and put it in your mouth.
What was in Ariel's pocket?
I heard it myself with my own ears.
They say that government projects are well known.
One third of it is suction.
His son, Saloom
Going to Souq Waqif
One lantern is eighteen riyals.
Put it in the budget.
And one hundred and eighty riyals each
They said we didn’t do anything.
You are helping him
Seek refuge from Satan
But I just feel that his head has started to soften a little.
God willing, my Lord.
He is the head of the committee and everything is under his control.
The most important thing is not to forget us.
We are your people
We must be together
This government project is an opportunity.
Sure, Ali.
And we can't do without you.
No need to tell us, Ali.
God willing, all those who will be part of the project team
This is for sure.
Yesterday, I and my friends were sitting and chatting.
We are on your side, you guys.
As members of the project committee, we are reassured.
They are afraid of the head of this committee, Saleh.
They say that
I have good news for you, Ali.
And reassure the group
Yes, by God, Abu Fahd.
May God bless you with goodness, but you didn’t tell me.
Then don’t forget, Saout.
No no
God willing, everything will go well.
Let him agree to this condition being valid.
What a shame on you
I don’t know if it’s going to rain or not.
Is it possible?
Okay, as long as you are with us in the department, you are a contributor to our project.
But the most important thing is that the matter remains between us.
Roast the tray of rice and meat in front of you.
I need to eat.
Bon appétit
You have something
If you keep spacing out like this
We never finish
At this rate, we will never finish.
Or any question is also a saying
We are here to help and support each other.
How can we get our share?
It’s not possible
What we write on it
Then, it’s not just us who will take it.
Everyone who contributed to the project is demanding their rights.
Why not?
Without this fear, Saleh.
We are the ones who set the budget.
The piece of land he bought today and registered in his name.
Meet her later
He told you he wouldn't buy it.
Where did you get this talk from?
He called me today.
He told me to call my brother’s phone, but it’s closed.
I told him good luck.
Tell your brother quickly.
See the second earth
The shoes that I bought for him yesterday fell on the ground.
They agreed to sell it.
He says call him and tell him if he wants it, I’ll register it in his name.
He wants to go and see her by himself.
And our right
And we consider ourselves contributors to it.
Even if we are not contributors
You can eat a piece of food as big as you want by yourself.
At least give your brother his right and your mother's right with you.
I didn’t come here to ask you for anything.
We are also contributors to the project and we have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her
That’s true, yesterday when Sultan came and asked him, he refused.
But I didn’t let him.
And you are wrong if you don’t set aside a budget for the project.
First stage
You are no less than others.
The committee members who are with him
I hear him talking to them on the phone.
They bring in their brothers and their friends
I know that this government project is a way
We don’t want a lump sum and then leave.
Capital
If my brother Sultan wants to attend the meetings with us, he can.
Because the members of the committee
Project budget
But that's all that is required.
You did your best.
Take care, may God protect you with goodness.
Your wife's brother
Do you like it?
He is helping us with the project.
Let us remember some of them.
We have distributed the tasks fairly.
You, Saleh
I have the lassamit, the bricks and the kankari on my side.
And the rest of the things are electricity and water, leave it to me.
Hey guys
Determine your share
By God, I
Sometimes I say I’ll take a lump sum.
And sometimes I say
Leave it as a percentage
It’s not Saleh’s problem, it’s not a problem.
Take what you want and in the way you want it.
The most important thing
We are still here.
Icon this week
Everyone decides on the amount they have in mind.
This means, for example,
After he left, he was surprised by himself.
He also wants an additional one hundred thousand.
Why did he come back?
Or what do you think?
I'm with you
even after the shareholders
Bring your loot, do your job, it’s none of your business.
You have halal orphans.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh increase the budget, increase it
You are very beautiful, Mashallah.
What is his income?
What is this? This is my father’s drink, not yours.
Any Sultan
Oh Sultan, my brother
So he is still considered a contributor.
This is the last name
How many names did your friend Saud put?
Ized Ized names Ikol Khanfahem
Okay, should I put it in the percentage group or the flat amount?
Don’t put it with the thieves.
Count how much you’re going to give him, how much you’re going to give him, I mean give him twenty thousand.
Just that
Even in a note here, they wrote
He is one of the kids from our neighborhood.
But Saud’s list is now longer than Abdulaziz’s list.
All of it is included in the budget for the first phase.
I don’t feel like Jackie at all.
This is the list that my mother gave me, Baji Baji.
She calls every two hours and adds people to the job as she pleases.
May God prolong her life, but hehehe.
Look, my son, my eye
And the one who delivers it to you, she is sick, poor and miserable.
But the woman has nothing.
Oh God, guide you. I have nothing to say to you. This is the last one.
Tell him to plant his liver.
How long does this moment last for you?
I need a job, a place to live and a hospital.
It means eighty thousand riyals.
You are a beautiful soul, you plant love.
Only your sister is precious
May God guide you, put her name on the list.
Husseina ei ei Husseina bint Ahllal
Why are you giving it to her from your own pocket?
Reassure him and tell him that there is nothing left from the second stage.
Two hundred and eighty thousand
Oh, good man, they will install a new liver for her.
Tell him, tell him to give me another two thousand, I’ll buy gifts for the girls.
I’m telling you two thousand.
A thousand riyals for me.
Ay Huseyne bint Ahllal
I can make you fail in front of your friends.
No more
I have a lot of work to do.
I’ll talk to you later.
That’s how the number of people eating from the tray increased.
The infrastructure can withstand it.
Don’t forget me, okay?
Write down the number you want
Madre returned
You and your conscience
I am the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And I say you deserve the million.
They will decide tomorrow when the project will start.
And now, God willing, they will start paying us the first installment.
We want to know how much
Will you give it to us all at once or in installments?
Why is this one more important than us?
Take a step, suck it up, the important thing is that you stay quiet. The committee is waiting for them now and they will come.
Come on, he said, come on, come on, he told you to shut up, so shut up.
You really have no shame and no imagination.
If I hear one of you make a sound
Cut his tongue short
Oh, it took them a long time.
You know, this is also money, not just like that.
It was beautiful before
Fifty million
I’m not joking, the oil is a little bit old
In the end, you are the president.
We don’t want a headache.
We adopt the budget.
From your talk about the project, Professor Saleh, we can see that it is a vital and important project.
And God bless you, this is not only for this generation.
Yes, yes.
Tomorrow is the opening of the first phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you.
I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations
Where will they take us? Where will they take us? The project
Where are we?
Where are we, Ashdrani?
That’s it.
You didn’t see the officials making a pilgrimage and people clapping for them.
We are at the official opening, what’s wrong with you?
So, does that mean that we are now working on the project?
We are in the project.
And the people of Arqata were rained upon.
I don’t know why they put this shack here.
It’s none of your business what happens in the shack.
This shack, God bless you, is the infrastructure.
The official opening of the international beaches
Ashvig for the third millennium
I swear I don’t know what you said.
Oh, thank God, old age is ugly.
I don’t know why they removed me, that’s just great.
But when he parks his car
I was surprised by Halieh Ana.
But when she told me
No one has sent me anything.
I saw her myself, and she has a huge farm.
Thank God, you are comfortable.
Check it out while you're sitting comfortably at home.
Why the harm? No, dad, don’t let anyone play with your mind, oh Sheikha Munira.
Be grateful to God, Munira, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
They are afraid for your share and invest it for you.
I have a headache
Her brothers don’t give her a penny of her father’s share.
We don’t know about these things.
This is a legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust. You don’t trust us.
I don’t know how.
I didn’t like what my brother Rashid said.
He goes and comes back with this cheque they give me every three months.
Okay, this is my right.
Everyone tells me
You don’t trust us.
Inheritance and money matters must be clear.
And when you are not comfortable with me being your father
You know what you do to people.
And this is Masalmeen, the poor thing, with you.
Who would believe that she inherited millions?
Abspha Brothers
Money ruined the world.
But the truth is the truth, and this is God’s law.
And then what?
And we will set up the company.
We invest in land, real estate and money.
No problems, no headaches.
She says she was walking towards the land in the desert.
But it’s too much for her.
Let’s imagine that she is telling him the story behind it.
What's the story?
Your sister started to bother you.
This is the story
She is planning to make a fuss for us.
Let’s give her some money from us.
Falcon, calm down
We need to find a solution, Rashid.
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
Those who donate to me every three months.
Everything is known.
Forty thousand, nothing has changed.
What the hell are they investing money in?
hollow his hollow his hollow his hollow
Why only after?
It doesn’t require thinking
They said we’ll add more so she’ll be happy and shut up.
Correct all your words, correct them.
They are all giving me a little bit at a time.
If I see their women
Al-Alamass teams have different shapes and colors.
And it is forbidden for me to live even half their life.
You begrudge me my father’s lawful property.
My puzzle
This is your right.
Legally and religiously
I feel that they are all robbing me and cheating me.
I’m not comfortable with their way, that’s it.
Oh, my God, Mom, you never know what happens in this world.
They humiliated me, my sick mother.
They do not know that there is an account and a punishment.
And God will punish them for eating forbidden money.
And bear it, Mom, and show them what the courts are all about.
I swear they will hatch.
Is it because we are many, or because of our large population?
That’s why I’m telling you, mom.
Here is a little gift
Everyone has a building that you would call a skyscraper.
I only want my right
My father, build a mosque for my son before I die.
I want to give charity to these poor people.
Okay, mother of Salmeen.
Leave my money in your pocket, mom.
And do not tell them about the courts.
And no false accusations
Do you know why?
At this time
She got what she deserved
Ask the accountant, Yay.
You are the one who is asking the accountant.
Answer them
I mean, I don’t mean, I mean, may God bless you, I mean, I’m here for your sister.
The door you entered from
Don’t make such a face.
Close the door you barged in from.
No, no
No Falcon
Saad Haram
Manour, don’t make a mess for yourself.
Show us your share in the company and the real estate, we have no objection.
Eight hundred thousand
She has always been silent.
This is definitely her husband, the worm.
Or else your sister is kind.
Jenny is trying to get them to dance.
A known and defined legal share
Tell her to take six hundred thousand or go to hell.
It is forbidden for them.
Expect anything, Munira.
My father's company
Eight buildings
Other than land and houses
Tell him six hundred thousand only
And I expect you to give up
No, Munira.
Endure it, they will cut you down and expect you to give in. Endure it, I’ve already told you.
You have the right, my father, to know everything about the lands and the money. It’s not up to them.
But the company
You are a partner with them.
Now they have kicked you out of the company.
I’m telling you, no one can stop me.
See what it is
Your father's company is
You don’t see him screaming?
Let me tell you, let me enter.
No need for that.
He has his papers, I don’t know what they are.
Oh, how long will he keep talking to us? I’ll cut his tongue off.
We are sorry
I’ll bring my brothers Saad and Saqr to my office and explain it to them, they don’t know what’s going on.
Come on in, guys
Look at brother Nasser, what is he drinking?
And they said to him: Welcome, may God bless you.
What changed t t t t t
You are making up a story for us.
She discovers that she is pregnant.
He discovers that she has four hundred thousand followers, not forty.
Come on, calculate it with me.
Ninety-six months
And this story, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million five hundred and twenty thousand
Normal, it’s all good, ya tayr.
He bangs his head against the wall.
Thank him by telling him.
This is our money.
All the young people who inherited it are like this.
May God bless you, we are the ones who ask for forgiveness, the company is yours, and nothing but good has happened.
We are ready.
This accountant is Samir.
Whatever brother Nasser wants, he can have it.
The whole company is at your command.
You want to take a shower and relax completely, don’t ask about anything at all.
You are free of blame.
How dare you
Taking the bait
Rotate through all files
It is supposed to have more than ten million.
Don’t even mention it.
Poor thing, she says.
Her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they had three lands.
And every land is bigger than the other.
May God be our sufficiency and our guardian against them, oh father.
What they are doing is forbidden.
I do not threaten them
What can I do, O Salman?
I have no choice but to sue them in court.
I’ll show you these two pages.
The case was postponed
Be patient, my father, Nasser.
Remind them of the court.
You’re kidding me, you left your bed and the doctor is looking for you.
Nationalist, Yam Salmeen
Go to your room, my daughter.
And heal the sick among the Muslims.
He didn't tell me.
Excuse me
Oh, I remember you, I know you, I know you.
Yes yes yes yes
What is it about, brother?
Don’t worry, you’re welcome.
He will be slaughtered now, the day he talks about millions.
Do you think that Abdullah they sent will be able to do it, God willing?
He is Rashid’s friend, right?
He has known him for years, fairly speaking.
Do you believe me, Munira?
Even Abdullah advised me about this.
Stay behind them
Do not destroy them, lest you destroy yourselves.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah told me?
Some people live to be seventy or eighty years old.
Our courts are for people who have lived at least two hundred years.
Umm Salman, may God have mercy on her
May God have mercy on her, she used to say
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
The case will take ten years or more.
We need to be framed in order to review the courts.
This is it
Hey boy, are you with them?
May God help you, God willing.
You are an old friend from school days.
This world is not worth anything
I’ll come to you in peace.
And you, God bless you, are from a well-known and large family.
And good people
Oh Rashid, we are friends.
Do it willingly
Or you will speak now
Come on, come on, no nonsense, a quarter or not a quarter.
Are you going to do it or what?
She took a set for 90 thousand from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get it from?
They spent their money on their women.
and they are depriving their sister of what is rightfully hers.
You still have hope, Nasser.
They fought with you
Yesterday when I spoke to him at the mosque.
Leave me like I told you
Arab kids and we are known
Why yes, why no
But I still say
O Allah, bless our gathering with these radiant faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with what is best for our religion and our worldly life.
Listen to you
Do you have another topic other than my sister’s inheritance?
He reproached him.
Qum Ruh Lala Tatabaks
What I owe you
I’ve been begging you for months, and you’re still stubborn.
I don’t care about you.
I’m going to court tomorrow morning.
Hollow hollow
Hello hello
Don’t mind her
You’re not going to court tomorrow.
Tomorrow after tomorrow Tomorrow after tomorrow
To give you a chance to show us what you can do.
Goodbye
We only understand the red eye.
And their reputation is damaged.
Come on, let’s see what they decide.
I’m glad you’ll tell me tomorrow that you’re busy.
She decided to go and file a complaint against us in court.
I told her to postpone it until tomorrow and we will go to her.
What is this?
May God bless your tongue.
You told me why
You want to go to court and file a complaint against us.
So that you can get your share of the inheritance.
She said
Your life has become sweeter.
Your world was distinguished
Why? I already told you the day after tomorrow.
When you arrive at the courthouse, park your car in the parking lot.
Ajwafeen is a security and safety device.
Go to the eighth floor.
This role involves judges.
The country's lawyers' syndicate
You will definitely need them.
You came here to make fun of us.
We want her to sue us in court.
Go to court
Audio lighting
And I expect you to give up for us.
It was in it
Show the way
Show the way
My brother walks
I forgot to give my sister Munira something important.
This is today's Al Raya newspaper.
Here is a good article
Only its author seems to be a doctor.
I want to see him, a gift from you.
Let him get out of the situation he is living in.
It’s a sin, I swear.
He has four children, he has a house like normal people, he doesn’t have anything.
He cannot be blamed for putting those around him above and below him.
A poor adventurer in this project
The one I never expected to do business is Abu Waleed.
Eat, eat, the children of the new merchant, Abu Walid.
My love, do you want me to put something for you?
No, no, no.
Okay, get up, get up, move, I’ll get you some fruit, some fruit.
Mom, I want the game that Hamood has.
Bon appétit, bon appétit.
Mama Walid, get up and bring your uncle some sweets.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Walid. You deserve it. Congratulations.
They arranged for me a quarter of an excellent accountant.
Take it, take it, dad.
Dad, now that we’ve become big traders, I want you to make me a room for myself.
Our student Joe has no capitalist ambition.
God willing, I will bring you a BlackBerry from the big ones.
Let’s leave your requests alone.
We are like human beings.
Instead of this mess we live in
First of all, let us pay off our debts, and then things will be fine.
Oh wow, you look very happy, Abu Walid.
He started eating more than before.
A merchant who is proud of himself
My parents are traders.
Project blessings
Leave it for the quarter.
May God protect you, your Lord wants you.
I met one of them, a Japanese guy.
I put my bag on the table and gave him my place, and he gave me a catalog as a gift.
One quarter of a loaf
But tell me, it’s an opportunity
Multi-purpose halls
It’s always like that
These halls are computerised.
Tap on Cinema
Suddenly a sports field appeared
This is magic
They were amazed and agreed all along.
I took a loan from the bank, a little from my wife's family, a little from me, and I sold a piece of land I had, thank God.
You are Madam, the committee has approved.
I placed the order with the factory since the ministry approved it.
And along the factory email
Leen Ayy is calling you
Zaatar
There’s nothing, I swear, I’m sitting in Ali’s office waiting.
The secretary didn’t call me, brother.
And ten are traveling
It’s you and your luck
Now my transaction is done.
The committee approved it.
Why are you the one who is not expected to do something? What happens?
You are not a full manager
Why don’t you go to him and get him to sign it so we can finish?
He had nothing in his hand.
Not all employees are like that.
Everyone is wearing his headdress like this, as if you were saying to a ship with a sail.
Thank your Lord
I swear, brother, I was reviewing them and I was worried.
And God willing, it’s over.
And this is Bu Fahd, no one knows when he will work, he works whenever he feels like it.
What should I do, brother?
Then I went back to the money.
I really need to finish the transaction quickly, I don’t know what to do.
I’m afraid the manager will ask about you.
He said it was sick, he said anything.
Even I’m waiting for Abu Fahd.
Okay, if you are the secretary and you say that, what is the solution?
Give me your number.
It’s not the secretary, sit down, sit down. It’s not the secretary, what’s wrong with you?
You didn’t call, I got scared, the group freaked out, they thought it was the secretary.
We are still waiting for Abu Fahd.
Baba plus my money I Khamam prayed
This one is free, this one too.
Wait a minute, guys.
Calm, calm, Ashos, calm.
Okay, they told you the guy is calm, but just shut up.
Now, Bu Fahd has to go to the airport.
How did it come out?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, let’s catch him at the car, come on.
Snow mask this
May God help you.
Look, Abu Fahd
Don’t blame your father, my love.
But he is very abnormal.
And if he receives the goods
He will lose his money
But I need it now.
Where are you sitting now?
What's wrong with you, Shador?
There is one in front of you.
He calls me in the middle of the night and wakes me up.
I told you, brother.
I told you
Mowheb Abidi Yabuj
Dad, I know, but it’s not possible.
Classes start next week at the university.
And if I register with them and they don’t accept me, I’ll have to wait for the next course.
Dad, it’s three months, it’s a shame to waste it.
So, Abu, look at me, I’m short.
I do this every day, I bring them back every day.
Wait for Bu Fahd, wait for Bu Fahd
And I'm just sitting at home
You don’t understand, man.
You only call at lunch time.
This is the fourth time you have called me.
You don’t understand, brother.
I know you need the money.
But God willing, Bou Fahd will sign the transaction this week.
and pay him the first installment
I don’t know what to tell you, sister.
He woke up with a start.
He walks all night and talks to himself.
And if Bu Fahd happened
May God protect us.
That's why
This week, Bu Fahd has to sign the transaction.
Abu Fahd, this is what he is waiting for in order to sign the transaction.
Bu Fahd will go to work tomorrow
And he travels for a year
And abandons the interests of the people
Yeah yeah yeah yeah how
I’m fine now.
Send me two texts
This strange heat is pulling me, Eterni.
What else is there?
I heard that I’m going to review it.
Because of my transaction
I told the employees I’ll show you what he’s like.
The deadline is almost over.
Give me the phone. Give the phone.
You are talking to Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I wanted to tell you
Tomorrow, I will definitely go to work, God willing, Abu Fahd.
First time you call
Come to me all the time
with the
You were never like this, brother.
I'm talking to you now.
And you look at my phone for me.
I said it was a sin.
At least so you can feel it
And if you are just
I’ll return you to your department.
Fifteen cartons of printed materials
And fifteen cartons of printing paper
I feel so sorry for you, I swear.
the manager who punished him
He brought it with us.
I heard about your factory.
He will lose a lot of money if he doesn’t finish his transaction today and they don’t sign it for him.
If he goes and tells the manager
Here are the people
And if the manager asks about him
Don’t worry, we’ll handle it, but let him go, it’s a sin.
Abu Walid
I’m going, but I’ll wait for a call, God willing.
Behold, a human!
May God help him.
Wait a minute, guys. Wait a minute, guys. Wait a minute.
And how would I know that he would come to the office, take some stuff and leave?
Look, Bu Fahd
No one move.
Don't sit down
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Until she comes
Look, Abu Fahd
Look, Bu Fahd
Wait, Abu Fahd
Let's go for a tour in Uzbekistan, Pakistan.
House by house
alley by alley
We are crawling towards you here, and the millions
Call the hospital quickly.
Don’t talk to the hospital.
Look, Abu Fahd
I have spent my whole life as a correspondent from those years until today.
By God, Omar, ya Abu Said.
How come?
He could have been burned forty years ago.
I am a reporter
Dukha Yabuk
And the sweat would pour down because there was no air conditioning back then.
And you think the bike was easy back then?
It has a yellow seal.
You’ve really tired yourself out, Bossaid.
May your father suffer
But what can you do, son of Adam?
Abu Sa'id
Oh God, forgive us, the manager has arrived, we’ll go and finish our work, as he says.
The manager has arrived, oh how sweet, come on!
Congratulations Boussaid
They say your son Khalid got a job.
How are you?
I told you, God willing.
Trumpeter
I told you, God willing, when the last of my children graduates, I will retire.
Graduate and work
Thank God, I’m going to finish my work now.
I did the message perfectly.
Thank God, we did our best, thank God.
Change it, Abu Said.
You deserve it.
You did your best, Abu Abdulaziz, may God bless you.
You did your best, Abu Abdulaziz, God bless you.
She she
We did our part.
The rest will continue the journey too.
H.K.
After all this age and fatigue
It means all of them are women.
You need to rest, Abu Said.
After he left you, my wife invited me here.
On the occasion of retirement
Coffee and dates, oh peace.
Come back and save me, dad.
You seem to be in a hurry for the khonfaroosh, Abu Saeed, huh?
Don’t worry about it.
Khanafroosh is ready.
Yay yay, God willing, it’s my pleasure. Goodbye.
I told you that the Khonfroosh is ready and waiting for me, oh my God!
I’ll finish all the papers for you now, God willing.
You have a chance to do it today.
Their manager told me he was traveling.
I don’t feel like it.
I don’t even have the energy to move.
Send someone over.
So you are officially considered free.
May God bless you.
Now I can finally take some time to rest.
You did your best, Abu Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
Park Lee Yabok
There is no work
So you’re not in a relationship, dad?
Please, for my sake, do this.
Which human resources
Thank you, thank you, goodbye.
Aki Zahro threw a party to celebrate her son's success.
He brought cake
I can't, my yacht.
I have a transaction myself, I’ll send my father to finish it for me.
Zahra is going to be upset.
I’m done, mom.
My father quit his job.
May God help him now.
He has worked a lot, let him rest now.
Let him rest.
Make me some khonfaroosh.
I made it and prepared it.
Antara was signed
Fear God in this old man, have mercy on him, have mercy on his age.
It’s your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
The poor guy wants to rest.
You humiliated this old man.
That’s what happened when he came back.
He is tired.
Do not consult me about their affair.
I don't complain about their affairs.
I was planning to take the transaction to the bank on my way to work.
And I am threatening, and if anyone is late, woe to him.
May God protect you, my dear.
Do your job, Tokali.
Look at this nose and these small Chinese eyes. Goodbye.
Busaid
This is what happens every day, they send you somewhere.
A good paralysis, mother Said.
It’s haram, it stinks.
In my nose
Khanfroush Khanfar
Main Ashodak
No, I’m in the branch near the market.
Go there and rest
I won’t go to the branch in the market anymore, they also told me it’s not there, I’m sure.
Inshallah, God willing, goodbye.
I have sunstroke.
T T write down the sun
I entered our neighbors' house.
The maid knew me.
What’s wrong with you, she said to me.
I beg you in the name of God to guide you.
No, I don’t have the strength to be a sweet seller, Yam Said.
Mom, where is my dad now?
From the Luya
This is what you say after you tell him which bank.
They told him that the papers were incomplete.
Tell him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the manager.
The important thing now is how is my father, God willing, he is fine.
I felt a little dizzy and my head hurt.
I’m telling you this in front of him.
Let your father rest.
Poor you, Uncle Said.
They must adhere to the schedule; reports are written about what they do, and that is why.
How are you?
Yes, Abu Shaheen.
You can say that I retired and I didn’t retire.
What do you mean?
The first of those years
We are destined to suffer
Your children are men
We are obliged to help them.
And the poor people tell me
You don’t have a clue, I swear.
So now young people who don’t have fathers can’t finish their transactions?
He returned to his job, a job that makes a difference.
A job that lets you go, that allows you to leave.
May God reward you with goodness.
Lala, I’m just next to you, it’s only the coffee that’s behind you.
Where, Abu Said?
I’m going to complete my son Saeed’s transaction.
This is the ministry here next to the coffee shop.
I will take her to the lands, and God will help us.
Goodbye
Mom, what’s wrong? Okay, I’ll see you later. Bye.
It’s better for you this way.
I warned you.
Because I heard you say it to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father doesn’t complain to you, then he’s your father.
We don’t see you silent.
And what speaks
You have humiliated him, you have made him poor, fear God for this man.
Your screams woke me up. What’s going on over there?
Dad, you were a government employee and you know what inventory means.
And hahaha hahaha hahaha they write this first
Now, really, now? What are they doing?
Dad, tomorrow is the last day to receive transactions at the Development Bank for loans.
La la la, who says?
That’s it, dad.
He told you two words and you believed him.
He told you that he has an inventory committee.
I'm sorry,
Oh, how are you?
Run, hurry up and finish your business.
There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
He came back from outside and he is silent.
I call him but he doesn’t answer me.
No shame, no modesty
No wonder your father took a stand against you.
If you are satisfied with this
May God reward you with the best, you have done your best.
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he attached to his bed?
Dear and precious, dad
You have never failed us throughout your life.
Wipe it on me
Leave him alone
And that’s it, dad.
The honored and the respected
Khanfroush Khanfroush
Thank you very much.
I want your satisfaction, dad.
May God reward you with goodness.
We have decided from now on
We should complete our transactions ourselves.
You did your best, dad. May God reward you. Thank God.
But please, for God’s sake, dad.
Consider it the last one.
But I can’t, it’s not possible.
Call me now
I’m not going to the minister, dad, I’m not going to him.
Will the minister be angry with you?
He’s angry, you have to go after him, go to him. No, no, no, this is not acceptable. Everything but the minister.
I don’t want to go, dad. I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t want to upset you.
No, don’t tell me and I won’t tell you.
Your transaction is with me and I consider it completed and ready.
It’s on your way when you go to finish my brother Said’s transaction.
May God protect you, dad.
Consider it the last transaction you will do for me.
Whatever you order, dad.
But your son had to sign this paper.
It means I’ll take it and bring it back tomorrow.
To be honest, I advise you to bring it today.
And if the transaction was not entered into them
You will wait for me after two months.
No, no, no, I’ll make him sign it now and then I’ll come back.
No, no, no, it’s not necessary.
Call him, just let him come in two minutes.
And I dedicate it to you.
So you don’t know Saeed?
No leave taken
He will not return until the evening.
No, all his friends are with him.
I’m asking someone where you are.
Tell me, I'm with Said.
I’m waiting for my shift to end.
Okay, dad.
Get rid of your papers yourself
John, you sent your children.
You don’t have any children.
I don't understand anything, uncle.
Welcome, uncle.
You did your best.
It’s no use.
I will leave you.
Go to the nursing home.
I don’t want to tell them where I’m going.
What are you telling them, Abu Said?
I’ll write something else for them.
Alhamdulillah
He got out of prison yesterday
No, by God, my sister.
We don’t care about this stuff.
I told him that neither you nor I should speak on the radio or on television.
I wish he would go to hell, we’re done with this nonsense.
May God guide him and fix him, God willing.
Okay, my sister, goodbye, may God protect you.
Is this a prison shower?
I was traveling.
Oh my sister, what can I tell you?
Call the program once, the one they call the Majlis program.
And he spoke to the man, my sister.
That is Khalid Jassim.
And he tells him, “Enough of this nonsense.”
My yacht came back, my work colleagues heard it.
My sister was talking about the government.
Talk about oil and money.
I don’t know, I don’t know what happened to this boy.
Not even a quarter of one.
Those who were happy with him and told him to do this and that
They all disowned him.
May God guide him back.
And I, my sister, I have to go, I have cooking to do.
May God welcome you
Come here, dad.
Come and sit down.
Enough nonsense, my son.
Oh God, dad, I’m tired and sick.
This is her in the hospital.
You don’t deserve it, God’s sake, mom.
I don’t want what happened to me to happen to you.
Dad, I didn’t tell you.
What is it, mom?
And he kept screaming.
I don't want you anymore.
Dad, this time you got away with it.
Here I am telling you
Don’t worry, mom.
Forget about it.
Enough nonsense
Okay, why did the poor manager finish?
It’s a shame that after all these years you come today and tell me that you fired me.
You don’t understand what I’m saying, Saleh.
Enough nonsense
Give us just one
Order, Saleh.
And you are a human being who doesn’t miss these things.
You are, God bless you, a follower of public affairs and a critic.
Not easy
It just means we’ve crossed out a few people.
And you are one of them.
You are not the one I mean.
Okay, goodbye.
Brother Saleh
But God willing, your uncle Abu Munira doesn’t know.
Oh, my father, I swear by your soul
Where does he know?
If I ask you
Tell him to work.
I told you they would fire him or not
I asked his mother and she said he was working.
I need to
My mom must be coming in.
What are we going to do with her now?
Our daughter got involved with him.
Whatever you order me to do.
I’ll give him a two-week deadline.
But if it doesn’t work, I swear I’ll grab him by his ears, take him to court and tell him to divorce me.
Have some coffee now, you.
You don’t buzz around like a fly unless there’s something wrong with your head.
Mom, honestly
I want to go out.
What you are looking for
I know you want to go.
Your heart is eating you up for coffee.
I want to talk and ramble.
Go on, get out of here and go to sleep.
Go look for a job tomorrow morning.
God willing, I will get up early.
Mom, I told you I’m done with it, I swear I’ve given up this habit.
I swear, that’s it.
Mom, honestly, I feel a little bit uncomfortable.
And don’t bring up the topic, enough nonsense.
Deaf war
We’ve had enough of the old nonsense.
Where are you, man? You seem to be on silent mode. Give us one of the old ones, man.
We heard, we heard, enough nonsense. We heard.
Enough nonsense
Enough nonsense
Saleh is present.
Salih Raqad
I think my son did something wrong and I don’t know about it.
All we know is that our friend Saleh is at the coffee shop.
I will tell you
Oh, mom, he did the right thing.
Because there were people there
You are just Nadia.
I don't want to waste your time with me.
One of the twins is at the door, his leg is broken.
But the blame is not on you.
The blame is on him for not putting you in your place.
My son, the bread of my hand, I know you well, whether you are good or not.
You're like these cigarettes.
Speak or don’t speak, say or don’t say, I’ll say enough of this nonsense, or I won’t say enough of this nonsense.
Here I am telling you
I'm sending it on the radio.
Walla Saleh, enough nonsense.
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high sense of patriotism.
We can’t hire you.
But what can we do?
Come on, forgive us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
Don’t tire yourself, John, you are dear to us.
No, by God.
Brother, I wait for you to say it every day, enough of this nonsense.
You are a brave man, brother, you don’t fear anything.
And if you see her, just tell her once
I am God, may God protect you, that's it.
What the hell, just say it, for God’s sake, enough of this nonsense.
Come on, the guy is begging you, just one at a time for his sake.
It’s awesome, brother.
The important thing now, may God prolong your life.
Regarding the job
The job is the opposite, you deserve it, you are a patriotic person and dear to us.
We were calling you to inform you.
John has humiliated you in front of people.
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor things, they want to hire me, but there are no jobs.
And now how will you and your mother manage the household expenses?
And don't forget after that
They have four children.
God is generous.
Don't despair, my love.
Keep hope
I don't stop.
You need to go look for a job.
Because my father doesn’t want to cause us problems.
I’m willing to do anything for you, Manira, I swear.
And I repent, I say enough of this nonsense.
We’ve had enough of this nonsense.
You know what he's doing these days.
I told you
But may God guide you, Abu Fahd.
You don’t listen.
I’ll go myself and tell the minister about the atrocities he’s committing.
The Minister's White
He definitely understands it this way.
You are right.
But that’s it.
What cannot be ignored
You know that the rumor that he will be put in your place and that you will be removed is very strong.
I'm looking for a way to get rid of him.
I don’t want anyone to think I have anything to do with this.
Your idea is right.
What are you thinking about?
The way to get Sultan out of your way
You’ve heard of Saleh Saleh, enough nonsense.
May God protect you, this is from our neighborhood.
He fell on him
Brother Saleh, you have deprived us of your voice.
No, Saleh.
I am one of your biggest followers.
No, it’s fine, Mashallah, there’s no need.
God willing, soon.
He comes back, you hear his voice and you are happy.
Bofahd himself is asking about you.
But tell me, Saleh
Why did you stop?
I mean, there are some problems, psychological and health problems, a little bit.
But to be honest
You are considered a fighter.
We haven’t heard it from you in a long time.
Oh God, oh God, oh God, I ask you, Saleh, come back.
Just once, for my sake.
I want to hear it from your mouth.
Saleh told you so.
No, guys, it’s really hard, I swear, it’s really hard, to be honest.
What’s wrong with you?
Real begged you
I am Abdul Rahman, I am a striker.
Then you didn’t tell me that you were looking for a job.
This is your chance now.
Let Real hear you and be happy with you. The next day, go to his office and ask for the job.
And a hollow if you don't tell you
I really want what’s best for you.
Do you know how?
That’s it, we don’t want to get up, go home.
No, no, no, no, no, that’s it, we don’t want it anymore.
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, let’s understand each other, brother.
That’s it, we don’t want it here anymore.
Okay, okay.
Okay, now, if I were to go back one last time, of course I’m a quitter, but this is the last time.
For example, Shiheb means Boo Boo Boo Boo Fahd loves to listen, he loves to listen.
Shally yansah means that there are a lot of problems and a lot of troubles, a lot of them exist.
What is the best thing for him to hear or what does he like, for example, demonstrations? I don’t know, you tell me.
According to the contract
By virtue of his responsibilities
Eighty-eight centimeters centimeter
The job is ruined
Don't interrupt me
Why did the employee do that?
Where VII VII
Don't interrupt me.
Seventh, Mr. Minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
He has a car that belongs to his brother.
Guys, enough nonsense.
And since you’ve come back to us with your voice, we don’t want you to leave us again.
People who are dear to me, I mean, the last time.
Or I honestly cut it off, I mean.
Mom, you said it was over and done with.
You were the one who prevented him.
Oh my daughter
I will expose this guy called Basna Kharabit on the radio.
I just heard that, but they only told me.
I suspect that there is someone in the ministry who is leaking information to him.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
He also cleared the air for him.
The minister is currently absent.
I don’t care.
All my time is dedicated to the ministry, may God protect you.
May God prolong your life, I heard about him.
Oh my God, I said it just for you.
He didn’t give me any attention, brother.
He didn't talk to me.
Abdurrahman, Iqbal told you to go to work.
He didn't talk to me.
You are a poor man, Saleh, by God.
I really feel sorry for him.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the whole story.
The group exploited you for a specific goal they wanted.
Unfortunately, they got to him.
And you know who is behind this story.
Abdel Rahman Ould Frijkem
He is the one who planned all this.
Bo Fahd, it’s impossible to employ you.
If one day you do to him what happened to Sultan.
You are famous, madam.
It’s impossible for anyone to hire you.
I’ll take you to court to get a divorce.
I found the solution.
We are now the best community in the world.
Flawless
We don't have it
We have no flaws at all.
We are comfortable.
What is mediation?
Even if someone knows you, they will tell you to wait in line.
Because it is the system.
He takes more rights than a stranger.
We do not rely on the stranger.
We don't have it
Your effort is your work. We don’t have flaws, we have flaws.
Or one of the big ones
He will make you stay at home.
We don’t have anything like that here.
And my regards
Salih Rashid Sa’ad Rashid al-Bahahiri
Famously known as Saleh Basna Kharabit
I don’t want dinner.
I was running, then I turned around and the shirt tore.
New shoes you just wore, I’m jealous of you.
I saw a boy wearing the new shirt that you and I just bought from Villaggio.
I’ll pull this out, I’ll take him to the sea, I mean I’ll pluck him out.
And this is good, he doesn’t fight.
I swear
You, Adul, when you saw a beautiful child, you became jealous of him.
It's not up to him
Why is Walid wearing a T-shirt?
You are only wearing a new T-shirt, you got upset, you got angry, tell your father to buy you one.
How do you see yourself?
Why did you tear Walid's T-shirt?
Let me tell you
Don’t make me pick you up and stick you to the wall.
I say, brother Sultan
Why did you hit him in the pussy like that and mess up his face?
Shame on you, you little kid, you’re not as old as this kid.
This is a child, this is a child.
Hey, kid
Otherwise, he needs good people and family to raise him and discipline him.
They won't let us
Sultan, I appreciate your words and your nonsense.
Take me to school, I'm a kid, I'm a kid.
You have always been arrogant.
Raise your children right.
And if you are not up to parenting and are not capable
I still respect myself.
I don’t want to insult him and humiliate him in front of his wife.
Ikhwan Ashkbarakum
I swear to God, if he comes back and hits Walid again or does something to him
He has no one to blame but himself.
I’m wasting my time with you.
Respect yourself, man.
Take me to her, let’s go to her.
I will respond to them
Oh, where are you, the old days?
And pure intentions
Oh God, grant us forgiveness and well-being.
Brother, don’t you have more than this?
No, no, no, this is the biggest thing.
Finish what you have in your hand and come quickly.
The extent of the disaster that has befallen us
But dad, just tell me what exactly happened.
Hey Ahmed, there’s a problem at home and I have to go.
Adol's pants are gone
This is the act of a hateful person with a sick heart full of hatred and malice.
Hathi Hathi is the act of his Sultan.
Where can he cut all these clothes?
I didn’t enjoy my new clothes, I didn’t even wear them. May God take revenge on them.
I have to show him
Sit down, I’m talking to you.
If you go at a time when he denies it, he will say, "It's a child and he did it."
What do you think?
You are my beloved Waleed, do you know how to ride a bike?
I know
Walid, my love
I say
Just say it.
Where did he put the scissors, Mom?
Under the bed
May God destroy their lives as they destroyed it.
But I’m worried about it.
I’m not going to keep quiet about it.
This is a crazy person who is not sane.
The most important thing now
And we will not change it.
But I will promote this computer thing.
I don't care
Our son Adil is a child, he broke their computer and we don’t know.
My soul, Nadia, my soul, Nadia, let’s see if he did it or not.
Stop talking nonsense, Fahood.
Go away, go away, go away from your friends, go away and laugh at someone else.
I’ll tell you to desist.
Laugh at someone else, Fahd, you're a spirit.
Welcome, Aweish
The time of quiet hearts
And pure intentions
In Yahoo
I am not the one who goes looking for his friends.
Laugh at someone else, Sultano.
so that he could accuse me falsely and slander me
Scissors
Respect yourself.
Hello, Abdulrahman, come to me, dad.
The blame is on your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
Dad, this is their situation every day, they are fighting.
I don't know.
A session like this
We should make her sit down.
To review our work
And the deeds of those who came before us
What we will become
Take lessons
And we learn
What a peace meeting, you look like children.
the size of a camel
Do you have children?
He doesn’t understand anything.
His role model is his father, not mine.
He takes his father as a role model.
You, Sultan
And you, Fahd.
And I am your older brother
Because of me
He paid for the computer.
Okay, now, when you reached out your hand to him
You guys made up?
No, I just stretched out my hand to get rid of him.
I will get rid of Abdurrahman's dog, he doesn't shut up after he starts talking.
Okay, where are you going?
I swear I won’t let him go.
You made it yesterday
Check it out, don't be shy
If you are a real hero, close the door. I’m telling you to close the door.
You said that Abdulrahman reconciled you with each other.
But I swear I’ll go into his room and break it to pieces.
Your brother
It’s not normal
Your brother is not normal.
I’m going to take a break and have some tea.
A cheetah with its head on its head.
Shut up, shut up, you kids are just fooling around, you have no shame.
You are like little kids, but dad, just stop it.
Oh, I swear I’ll show you, I’ll show you, I swear I’ll show you.
Hit him, hit him, oh mom, hit him, look how big he is.
Blood, my mother
This screaming is breaking my heart.
Oh God
Leave us alone
Oh my God, dad, that’s shameful.
This is me, your community and your interests.
I won’t let them down.
The day will come when the night will reconcile them.
He didn’t have time, mother.
And therefore, he must
May God protect him
Hajji Fasih
But, Mom
May God guide you.
You are supposed to calm down
Mom, bring more wood for the fire.
Oh God, may it be good. What’s happening?
Come on, Abdulrahman.
I wanted you to be my helper, but you became a pharaoh.
You are the sensible one, dad, may God guide you.
Two after each other
Spread out, spread out.
You have embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Sa’d is watching you and laughing at us.
Officer, we want him, we want him, and we will tell him.
Don’t worry about him, the officer banned him.
All three of them were deleted.
Please
Brother, don’t come to me, you still don’t come to me.
The officer banned him. Believe me, I saw them from above.
I heard that the officer arrested him.
From above means far away.
Believe my brother when he says that
Please, you have now signed that your children will not do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome, please come in.
The officer banned him. How do you make them walk? Believe me, I’m sure.
Listen to me
I didn’t want to tell you this in front of them.
This is Abdulrahman, their older brother.
Assistant Deputy Minister
And the second is their middle brother, the director of the authority.
Take two Panadol pills and rest, my soul.
It was banned by Officer Ay Pendulum.
You have two paracetamol pills here.
Wai wai, may God protect us from the enemy.
May God be sufficient for me against the enemy.
May God be sufficient for me against the enemy, they played a game with me.
What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?
Who can come from there to here?
This is his father’s big hand, he made a flat thing and throws it away.
Do you really believe that?
He looks like a good, respectful and polite man.
He says this is the daughter of the poor.
Even if
He’ll catch up with you now.
He won’t take his eyes off you.
I’ll destroy you.
All of this is fine until you get the chance.
What does it mean that she turned to look at you when you passed by?
It means by chance.
You turn around and she turns around at the same time.
No, but there must be something.
I notice you when I pass by.
I feel that she is happy inside, she has joy and happiness.
Go tell her to give me a pen, brother.
Take my notebook.
Do you believe it? I don’t even know her name.
Too much of a romantic
No, dad, we are now in the 21st century.
You look like you're really going to get it, man.
To be honest
How long have we been sitting here?
No, go ahead.
And from today, I intend to dedicate myself to you.
But you really need to rest a little now.
My father still has an outdoor shoot to do after yesterday.
We are not destroyed, by God, and the horses reached the secretary. I told him, "Look, I don’t want press interviews, television appearances, or even contracts."
Let me have some time to spend with my family.
May God help you.
Even when you're busy
The first thing that comes to my mind
And I have the number of its owner, I will call him today.
What were you late for?
They sold the villa and have been living in it for a few days.
I love series and acting.
Umm Abdulaziz says they are poor people and live a simple life.
It’s their share, we don’t have a share in it.
May God bless your morning, uncle.
I hope nothing bad happened.
Dad, this car is calling us every other day.
It seems that your father’s battery is dead.
No problem, don’t worry, I have the tire and I’ll fix it for you now, God willing.
May God reward you with goodness.
We are ready, we are ready, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
I’ll look for a flat near you tomorrow and I’ll live there so I can come to you every day.
Tell us what you have and what you want.
That’s it, dad, enough.
Please come in.
But Walid, what?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name
I went back to Abuj's house.
Did you believe it?
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, the actor I love, turned out to be Yarna.
Everyone praised him.
They say he is humble and kind.
Home is where the heart is, yes indeed.
I don’t take pictures with him.
So that my colleagues at work believe me.
I can’t believe that our house is next to the house of the actor Rashid Abdullah.
Talk to him, talk to him so he believes it.
The depths of the earth
What we see on TV
I wish I could see him.
Our friend has arrived, thank God, thank God.
If they want a jalboob with a sail, I have it.
I’m here, but guys, go easy on me, I’m still not used to it, I haven’t gotten used to it yet.
You have received the news.
Yes, he did his best, may God reward him a thousand times.
Peace be upon you
They confirmed that there are employees who are being transferred to the new branch of the ministry in Adkhan.
What they told you is not coming back.
I didn’t hear the names.
No, but what I heard is definitely true.
His name is Abu Ali and he is with them.
My name is I
But until we know exactly who we are moving
I, I, where am I, where am I, and where is the smoke? May God protect you, I can't.
Dad, can you do this job or not?
The committee is still studying the issue.
But if you were chosen
The blessing has visited us, Abu Walid.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali.
Sorry again, brother Rashid, it’s about the furniture.
We are neighbors today.
His people reckoned him
This is because of your good nature, Abu Walid.
May God reward you, brother Rashid.
I’ve heard a lot about your kindness.
May God perpetuate love.
But, my daughter.
I’m ready to go around with you until you find the nicest and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When will I come back? To be honest, the furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
God willing
I told you that before, my sister.
If you need anything
Consider me like your sister.
May my eyes never cry
Where did you go, my love?
She called me yesterday and I forgot to scold her.
No, my love, I don’t want to tire you.
No more
Okay, goodbye, I’ll call you later.
To be honest, I was talking to her.
But these people are not like us.
They are all rich, where are we and where are they?
Mom, you don’t have to.
What’s up, mom?
Wait for me just a little bit.
And I will give you the signal when to ask for her hand in marriage for me.
I told you
It’s okay, mom, don’t worry.
She comes to me and says, "Propose to me."
I just put the dinner in the living room.
If I wanted to have dinner
I’ll have the driver take her to university, God willing.
And then we agreed that we are family.
Whose car is this?
Soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
They support and love good, yes indeed.
Yes, you are right, dad.
Even if our parents don’t do that.
And my name is definitely with them.
Are you sure?
What a disaster! What calamities have befallen us?
I’m shocked now, my head is spinning because of this news, I don’t know how to react.
Soul soul soul soul soul soul you are now, God willing, God willing, it’s good, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you
What’s up, Abu Ali?
The committee met today
And the list of names of those who are being transferred came out as smoke.
My name is Wiham
Go talk to the manager and have him remove your name.
I don’t think there’s any benefit, O Ali, I don’t think there’s any benefit.
He asked me and told me there was no hope.
The great artist
Consider your name on the list.
You did your best, Abu Salem, God bless you.
Come back, please.
I want to take a picture with you so I can show it to the kids.
Oh, my kids will be happy now.
May God keep them for you, God willing.
A picture of an artist
At your service, may God protect you.
Welcome, welcome.
Ava Alayk Ava Alayk Hazer
You and those who are dear to you
I said it would be better a day or two ago.
Come on, come on, mom, get ready.
Get ready, get ready, what’s your right?
What’s wrong with you, are you crazy?
She said I have no objection.
I will kill your mother.
Come on, go to them.
But my son, that’s enough.
I don’t want them to think that we are poor people and that we are just getting by.
You need to look good.
Where can I get clothes to wear and look good?
You got me in trouble with people.
What’s up? I’ve never seen you wearing jewelry before.
It’s not mine.
Umm Ali's right
Um Ali is proposing a marriage for her son Ali.
You want decent clothes and some jewelry.
She said she wanted to show them that they were good people and had good things.
Oh oh, Mashallah.
Who can do it?
Mashallah, look at her, my Emirati girl has grown taller and turned blue.
Mashallah, I have nothing to say about the gum.
You are a queen, Mashallah, you are a queen.
You still need to get ready.
Because they say that my father should come to meet her father.
I’m definitely not going in these clothes.
I first went to them like this in my new outfit.
Come on, mom, go easy on the woman’s stuff.
Um Walid didn’t hold back, she gave you her stuff, so go easy on them.
ee ee
Then we should also become like them, Zain.
Why didn’t his mother go and propose to him?
But those women
Now I have to go and see the men.
May God keep you safe, just as you are.
Nothing else, may God bless you with the cloak.
The good people did not fall short.
They didn’t fail us, we stayed in the cloak.
When I come back, I’ll take it from you and complete the set, okay?
Everyone is waiting for you
But brother Rashid, how can I leave him like this or help him with his cloak?
But just look, come here first.
This needs to be closed.
aha, yes, I am from Istanbul
Grill a stick, the dress is yours, but look
This is God, may He protect you.
Left hand inside the bisht
He was threatened to be destroyed in this way.
The Pashtun attitude comes from below like this.
God God
Wow!
Walk, walk, you want to feel heavy, you want to feel a little heavy.
Oh God
Act like a millionaire
May God grant you seconds that they didn’t give you.
The left declined, the right rose
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What’s wrong with Aisha?
Do you know what he just told me?
You say that because you are my friend and we don’t want to part.
I’m telling my brother to come and propose to you.
Tell your friend not to say anything to her brother and embarrass herself.
Empty speeches have been abundant these days. A few days ago, Suad told me that she wanted you for her uncle, and today it’s for her brother.
They want to take my girlfriend.
I was sitting and watching
Everyone knows the relationship between us.
They don’t know that we are just colleagues.
That’s it, I’ve had enough.
They have to know tomorrow.
Why did Walid refuse?
I'm screaming
You are rejecting my son Walid.
The actor is more honorable than you, you hypocrites.
But you guys
Have you been acting all your life?
It's not your roles
Serve people
You attract people
You wear your acting clothes in life in front of God and His creation.
The cloak I wore on TV
Me or you?
I wore accessories, gold and jewelry.
And you played the role of
You got married
What do you see?
One walks in front of his wife.
He took off his ghutra like this, on both sides.
He does not look neither to the right nor to the left.
It reminds me of that friend of yours that you talk about who is with you in the office.
Come with him, a boy and a girl.
Why did he start walking like that again?
As they say
May God help him, man.
Walk straight, don't stop.
He is a poor man with no personality at all.
He laughs happily
He made us my grandmother's outfit.
No, no, no, this is not good, and you are sitting there.
That’s how it is when you walk while standing up. Get up, stand up, get up, get up.
I’m begging you, Khamis, I’m begging you.
What? You're going to the city?
Come here, I need you for a bit.
Where are you going? Sit with us for a bit.
His wife made a mess of him.
You must like it this way.
Oh, Thursday!
Turn off the TV and if you see a presenter
I’m afraid that you will cause me problems.
I swear to God, it’s work.
I’m sitting here, I swear I’m sitting here with Salem, my colleague at work.
Pilgrims
The line is blocked iod iod
She slammed the phone down, she’s going to cause me problems at home now.
Now when you say I didn’t leave, you mean your friend is jealous of me because I’m with you, mm, once.
Come on, now, now, maybe it will arrive. God help me with the package.
and then kicks you out
You’re not the first one to shoot.
No, no, no, he can’t, my brother.
I torture my mother in her grave.
My mother advised me to
She told me not to shoot.
No, no, no, I can’t, it’s impossible.
I'm looking for something you have.
Lalala kh kh kh khalak khalak
You are really not normal.
Don't come to me and you
Tell me, I want to understand what’s going on.
No, no, no, mom, I don’t allow you to say that.
Salem in particular is one of the best young men we have in the area.
He told you to let go
He came back and told me to divorce her, just divorce her. What do you mean? Am I a bull? How dare you?
No, Thursday, you look like you’ve officially gone crazy.
Leave me alone, for God’s sake, may God protect you.
I was talking to him alone, how cute we are.
May God guide you.
The poor man has a broken heart.
I want to give him the message that came from the minister’s office, it’s important.
Give from God, may He guide you, give from Him.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Bring it, I will take it to him.
Because of tomorrow’s meeting with the women’s delegation that is coming to us.
A women's delegation
What’s wrong with you? What’s wrong with you? You’re not sleeping today.
Hello Salem
I am your brother Khamis.
No, I swear to God I’m talking to you while I’m awake.
My brother
Delete my name so I don’t get blocked, brother.
What do you mean by deleting your name?
The only one who can delete your name is His Excellency the Minister, and only him.
Brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Social and official
I need
Hello, hello, hello
Tell the truth
That’s the one I was talking about when you were hiding behind the tank.
Salma Salma Salama, by God, Salama
As long as you talk to Salem
Are you talking or what?
It's me, Ali.
It's not me, Khamas.
You’re not telling the truth, are you?
No, I'm not casual anymore.
She suspected that I was talking to someone, brother.
This is the life, man.
And may God keep you safe, Salim, call me.
And may God bless you for believing me.
That’s who told you to call.
It’s none of your business.
Don’t interfere in what doesn’t concern you, or else I’ll show you what I can do to you too.
I will file a complaint against you.
Hello, is that you?
How do you live with a woman who has such a long tongue?
Let’s start the meeting now.
Long live you, Hassan is going to call Khamis.
Okay, let’s discuss the real estate budget first.
Please come in.
I hope he finds it, God willing.
I’m telling you, as soon as he saw the women, he got scared.
I went to the ministry to look for you, and you are hiding here.
Come on, come on, the team is waiting for you in the meeting room.
I can’t sit with women.
Hey Khamis, how does your wife know?
I’m afraid you’ll call.
You want her to doubt me? Come on, man, don’t you understand?
Ikon, take me and Michelle back, then take me home.
Your wife will only call at this time.
Of course, you are a big company.
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry.
One of the largest projects in the history of the ministry.
Hey guys, what’s wrong with the table? It’s shaking.
No, Your Highness, it’s not this table, it’s me.
Please answer.
Who is with me?
Which Syrian asked for it?
My phone is for you
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I’ll tell you.
He fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Oh, her brother!
My sister told me that if you continue to do this job with women, don’t come home.
That is why he submitted a letter to the ministry to have them transferred from our department.
He told me exactly that the minister agreed to transfer him, which means he did what you wanted. What else do you want?
What the hell is his wife like, brother?
This is what they intend.
What can I say, Khamis? Who can I talk to?
I’m telling you, he’s not right.
So what are you going to do now? Your wife and kids are coming tomorrow.
I swear I don’t know what to do.
And you fulfilled her request, why didn’t you go back home and see your children?
Because she wants to make sure officially.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, that’s what I did. I sent her brother and gave him the paper.
Because she wants to see the minister’s signature and make sure.
And God willing, if you agree, God willing, we might go home tonight, God willing.
This is my brother and this is the minister’s signature.
After the two parted ways
Tomorrow he will be working in the new department.
This means that starting tomorrow, he will have a different office and a different job than the one he had before.
Which way is this section, may God protect you?
God bless you, and this is the minister's visa.
Nothing, nothing, that’s on your right hand.
Yes, yes, God bless.
Here you go, your office is ready.
Saad, Abdul Qader, and Mashallah, that means a big office, yes indeed.
Goodbye
How to request a transfer
The whole department is women, brother.
Madam
And no one can make a decision again except the minister himself.
You have to stay until the minister comes back.
Dude, just agree with your colleagues.
And you called them by men's names so that your wife wouldn't know.
And I left two more for you for the new employee.
The new employee, I mean the new employee.
I swear, the minister’s office has turned into a place where only men work with us.
Are you serious?
His face is funny, imagine a man sitting between five women, he looks like an antique.
But they just told you that his wife is jealous of him, she’s insanely jealous.
I'm sorry, I
A poor man who lives within his means.
But he asked us that if his wife called, we should not talk to her. We respected his request and remained silent.
Abdul Qader, who is with you in the office
This is not too expensive for you, you should see if it fits you or not.
My son called to say that my wife is coming to my office.
What are you doing?
Go straight, first door on the right
This is the welfare office.
With Khamaso Bo Al-Niswan
These are six female employees.
He is there, I attacked him, he is present.
Don’t do these moves
This is my wife, she is jealous of me.
Because I'm sweet
May God guide you now, Sultan.
We just want to know where we have reached.
What happened was that my brother Saqr and I were at the bank yesterday.
Look, from this point of view, the project
Hello
Brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Come on, go to the kitchen quickly, come on.
I’m dressed now, I’m going out.
You should be in the kitchen in the first place.
We have no women who obey men, God willing.
And if the scorpion angers God, may He protect us from its sting.
This is essential for rain. Look, look.
Look, uncle
Aisha, please call the secretary and ask him to inform the employees.
Tell them that Munira postponed today's meeting to tomorrow.
God willing, it will be good.
They issue such orders.
Woe to us if we do not implement it.
They should know that you are a senior official.
Communications and responsibilities prevailed
They all think that a woman is just a servant.
I have never seen people in my life who despise women as much as they do.
These people are still living in the old days.
Don’t go to work, come here, go to the kitchen and make us tea.
Where are the servants?
The second one has been missing for a week.
Even the servants were not spared their insults.
They are right to be fed up.
May God help you.
The notes from the bank are simple.
Coming
My uncle is also something, what do they mean?
The compound of villas is not nice at all without a garden.
Okay, the garden now.
Before you go out, sister, I want to get your opinion on a matter.
My love, Fatoum, I have to go to work late.
Okay, come on, tell me what you have, come on.
Are you going to talk or should I go?
Play it at school
Yat returned to the women’s union committee.
The school chose me to play with them in the team.
Who are you?
Now you’re telling me you’re going to the national team.
Do you know what your brothers and your uncle would do to you if you thought of telling them this?
You can only blame yourself.
That’s what we warned you about.
I swear to God, I’ll pass by and greet her. I haven’t seen you in a long time, dad.
I haven’t seen you for a year, a whole year.
Did you marry him or not yet?
May God guide you.
Who would take someone who is neither educated nor has a certificate and doesn’t know anything? May God guide you.
No, no, no, it’s not a flaw for a man to be uneducated.
And then this is Khamis, the son of the scorpions.
He bit him, he caught him.
No, we only take one person who is not compatible with us and is not at our level.
A needle like him
May God help you.
What should I do, Aisha?
The minister has traveled and all transactions are being transferred to me.
And the word of truth is that Mustafa, the director of the security resources administration, will see you tomorrow.
But the ministry’s guests arrived today.
The program you have
And now I’ll take care of you, Aisha.
Hi Maryam
Okay, come on, I’m coming, I’m coming now, come on.
What do you say, Aisha?
Where did these disasters come from if not from these brothers?
I don’t know what happened.
Honey, you need to apply compresses so that your face doesn’t swell.
We warned her and told her not to tell them.
She told them comfortably that they would beat her and fuck her.
You know if I told them I hated it.
John, I’ve been upset with you for a long time.
You play Ava ball
Next time I will break his neck.
Know who is talking to you
The Scorpion's Lute
Hulk is here
But uncle, I didn’t hit Sultan, he was the one who hit me.
I don’t understand
I chose economics and political science.
Honestly, I chose graphics because this specialization is in demand these days.
Architecture
It's not your turn
You took your chance.
Greed is not good, my father.
Tamer the Scorpion
Hit it, break it, break its teeth, dislocate it.
Give it to me
I have some stuff here, come
You go on missions
I am majoring in architecture.
Make yourself comfortable.
To make sure
Sultan and Saqr, I spoke to them.
They don’t mind marrying you to Munira.
What else do you want?
No, our Thursday-born son deserves it.
I’ll arrange an appointment with them and let you know, God willing.
You were nominated as part of the delegation.
I understand your circumstances.
But give yourself a chance tomorrow.
I’m telling you the truth.
You are very interested in me.
And you were nominated from above
He was right.
My brothers and I know them
It’s impossible for them to agree.
I am surprised by them.
Their car instalments are paid from my salary.
I'm the one who pays for the house.
No, don’t come to me again and say travel with me.
We were planning to marry her this week.
What do you say?
The idiot Thursday who doesn’t even have a middle school certificate.
Marry him and travel with him.
In the name of knowledge, oh God.
What they are doing is a sin, by God.
If she refuses, they will kill her.
Dad, how many times have I told you?
Wherever you go
Tomorrow, tomorrow, God willing.
Don’t worry, I’m a scorpion, son of scorpions.
Even if he brings a gift, it’s okay.
I want to marry Khamis.
Go to the kitchen, for God's sake.
And put them in the living room.
Tonight is the Real Madrid vs. Barcelona match.
I hope Valencia won’t beat us, God willing.
I’m talking to you from reliable sources.
She is dedicated and hard-working in her job.
What do you think about what happened now?
We wanted to do
We are forced to continue
Please go to your desks.
Thank you, may you live long.
I am a man.
Pour it there.
The Minister's Messenger
May God protect her and prolong her life, she is present.
Please come in, sir. Please come in.
Good evening, Minister Siah.
Yes, may you live long.
I washed the shirts.
Pour coffee for Captain Emad's soul.
And then again
We are traveling to China the day after tomorrow to play a match there.
Captain Naseeb, let me introduce you to my sister, Mariam.
Where are you going, uncle? I'm going to Bab Abi Amlij.
You are an ass.
You don’t know your elbow from your armpit, you want to become a minister.
God willing, say hello.
Yes, auntie.
The spirit of Kat, which has a whisper, is another one.
Representatives' contacts
Do you believe it? A little while ago, Mishael called me.
Then plumb it
It’s a sin against you, Nof’s role is not suitable for Masha’il at all.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mashael Yatraoli means twenties
Okay, why don’t you take Mary’s role?
What suits her more?
Nof's role is thirty
Get rid of this disaster that they have put us in the committee.
This is a problem, I’m sure he won’t be quiet.
And he will stop us at the unit.
He talks to you about art, family values, meaningful art, and content, I don’t know what.
This is the one who put it for us in the committee.
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
Me, you and Hamed can influence him, but how?
No, no, no, it’s impossible.
Because there is nothing to prove that it belongs to me or Al-Hamed.
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks.
After he finds our names
May God protect you, the company is registered in the name of Hamed’s wife.
I don’t worry about it from this point of view.
Then make sure who the head of the committee is, it’s not me.
The last decisive word is mine.
Lala, dad, everything is fine. Welcome, welcome.
I just talked to them and agreed with them on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, Professor Rashid, please come in.
And as you know, you know that this meeting is dedicated to deciding whether to approve the series "Rape of Conscience".
It is produced by the Modern Arts Touches Foundation.
A sweet, strange, bold, action-packed series
I am with Hamed
Frankly, the series has a very nice story.
I'm with you, Hamed.
What I liked most was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to put the gun away and then dropped it in the car.
You don’t know that this is his son’s car. When the police came, they searched it and it was an action.
She picked up her son from school.
And he shoots the cartoon with his leg.
John gives him that powerful kick, and the carton flies and enters through the window of his mother's room.
Here is the surprise
Oh wow, this is the scene, this scene, and the cartoon is in the mother's room.
It’s great that a local company has reached this level of work.
We need to encourage them and take them by the hand.
But brother Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion.
You left it to brother Rashid.
With respect to your opinions and impressions about this series called Rape of Conscience.
A rape of human values
And some nasty surprises
One and a half men in every episode
We’ll leave the text for the next episode.
A series written without social awareness
It does not carry a meaningful message that would improve society.
Tears are falling, so you have to cry in the scene.
Rashed, please.
You gave your opinion, Ali gave his opinion, I gave my opinion, let Mr. Rashid give his opinion too.
It is obvious from the sitting
It means that I can smell an agreement between you.
Matters are sorted out
Some people understand this and it is their specialty, while others have nothing to do with the subject.
I reject this series.
I’m afraid he’ll get us involved and cause us problems.
Don’t pay attention to him
What can he do or what is he able to do?
I keep my word.
John gave me the bag and told me that it was from Mama Samira.
I don’t know what’s going on again.
I can’t believe it, Nasser.
This is the new series I told you we’re going to make soon.
The driver who raped their daughter
Because of the great good that came out of our relationship
The first good thing is, of course, this beautiful ring you have on your hand.
I’ll tell you how
On behalf of Hamed’s wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role, of course, was to fix things and issues.
He has a five percent share of the work.
A sweet role
These are just examples, like the series you saw about the rape of a lost girl, it was very nice.
By the way
What is rape? Rape, what is it, oh God?
Rape of dreams
Why are all the names like this, I mean, similar?
For example, last year most of the series were all about girls.
It means that you will find more than eight or ten girls in the series.
Durg Mazon
How many torches do we have?
Oh, oh, your luck has turned around, what else do you want?
Hello Omar
I don’t care, I don’t care.
Syrian, my love, I have to go to work, Mary, what happened?
Take a minute and go
He says he wants to see me for something urgent and important.
I have to go.
What I know is that Rashed went and met the minister.
He told you he sat with him for half an hour.
They said that these people will get you into trouble.
I tell you that he complained about us, and you say it's good.
What happened now is that the minister’s office called me and asked for me.
And they were afraid that the minister believed him.
I will meet the minister.
The man just wants to get his point across in the series.
No more
This is correct, sir.
But first, I, the Minister’s assistant, would like to clarify a point, and it is not my habit to talk about a fellow artist who is not present.
May God protect you, Rashid. This is his characteristic and everyone knows it.
He hates everyone around him.
All material interest
But he is still a specialist.
But God bless you, it doesn’t mean that every person who comes and gives an opinion should replace you in technical matters.
especially television works
A series of rapes of conscience. God bless you for what we are working on.
A huge, bold operation
At the Gulf level, God bless you, we will have a media scoop.
And a terrible spread
This is of course your specialty and you know more about it than I do.
A hollow condition, a white-faced serial IP.
And raise our name high
But what the journalist Abdul Hamid wrote, listen, listen, listen
One representative even commented that
The series contains immoral calls.
He laments the decline in moral and artistic taste in work.
This is a bold statement and a strong criticism.
Your people will be humiliated if journalist Abdulhamid follows them.
If their words reach the officials
These are smart people who know how to manage it.
The tail of a gang
We want to create our own website.
We put all the company's activities in it.
The company told me what its name was.
From today onwards, you are the media consultant.
The series Rape of Conscience, produced by Atard Productions, is considered
A qualitative leap in Arab drama
because of the noble ideas and values it carries
It is a series aimed at developing society.
The journalist Abdulhameed is the same person who criticized them a few days ago.
It’s possible that he’s changed so much, a hundred and eighty degrees?
How can Abdulhamid accept this for himself?
The journalist Abdelhamid and his ilk
Don’t worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me what I thought of the series, and I told him that the series is going to be a hit across the Arab world.
May God hear you.
Guys, my artistic sense tells me that our series is going to be a hit.
We don’t know where he is.
And this is him putting his bag down and leaving.
I’ll start by encouraging you.
All of you are like this, the things you bring in the series, we have neither seen them in our lives nor heard about them.
The writing is clear from its title.
To be honest, all your authors are children.
What happens if it happens or if it doesn't?
Your series is boring, boring.
What do you think?
He seems to be shouting a lot, dad.
We only measure ourselves by the standard of stupid TV series.
Anyone can understand it and grasp it the first time.
In threads and hidden dimensions that require focus for one to understand what this work wants to say.
By the way, this work is actually political.
It’s a sin to show it to people.
What’s wrong with you?
Anyone who sees you like this would say you ate poison.
Yesterday evening, Ali and I were at Souq Waqif.
And we're sitting in a coffee shop
He didn’t give me a face
Nasser, what do you think about this topic? If His Excellency the Minister gets upset, it will be a big problem.
In one week, he will make us all stay at home.
God, the series is just okay, it’s not that bad, everyone who saw it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to go to him.
And he must have told him that I told you this series is a failure, it’s bad and there’s no action in it.
Oh my God, what a disaster, guys!
Leave the topic to me.
What should I do if I miss you?
Listen to me, Eli.
From now on, I don’t want any post on your page that criticizes the series.
Please, Elie.
I saw the topic a few days ago, there is no criticism of the work, there is only abuse of the work.
Please don’t make me mad at you.
He plotted against him.
But I was an opportunity one day.
If I were you, I would never say such words.
But to be honest, I didn’t receive a single message thanking me for the series.
Sho Sho, an unprecedented success
Goodbye
Brother Rashid, let me
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Rape of conscience, the pearl of television series
Long live you, this is a journalist we have an agreement with.
Listen to the second newspaper, what they wrote.
Then they agree with people, read, read on the readers' page.
My heart stopped.
But they didn't tell me to grill it.
Yeah, dad, you’re lucky, the minister is happy with you.
To be honest, Nasser, by God
Get ready for the rape of conscience, part two
No, no, no, my brother, I don’t want this to pass.
The first and last series I wrote
I’d rather work in scrap metal than do this job, dad.
Part two after this disaster
Third and fourth
What’s wrong with you? You don’t want the benefit?
One of my friends is sitting in his majlis.
That’s us in it.
The magician said
Go ahead
We want a word on the occasion of this revision.
Thank God for the success
The skeptics are enemies of success
I am surprised
How can a series win an award when it’s boring and a failure?
But these are specialized people.
They gave him awards, they must have seen something that we didn’t see.
Prepare a second part of the series for us.
God willing, may you live long
They said he was a magician, but he was a magician.
I remind you of the rape of conscience, part two
I saw you standing with the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals, we agreed, you know.
I hear him telling them to get ready, there is a second part coming.
The same thing
Dirty money is put into banks to be laundered and comes out clean.
These series that I see are low, weak, despicable and worthless.
They will enter it in Gulf and Arab festivals.
They clean it up, give it awards, and it becomes a high-class series for people to watch. They clean it up.
Is it possible? Why is it not possible?
As long as the jury members themselves are the ones producing the series.
Peace be upon you
Peace and mercy be upon you. Thank God you arrived.
Yes, we have signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the price.
Come to the office.
We are a small bakery and we have two bakers who sell roti and bread.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
Don’t download a single dollar
They want it or we cancel the contract.
The contract we signed yesterday is enough.
With the European company

What you see
A great job worker A job worker like no other
For the first time, I will release a product that will be the first of its kind in the world.
This is what I brought, not the biggest roti baker in the world.
I'm telling you
How to make roti with sauce
Cut it with your hand, or you will go to the kitchen and spend an hour looking for scissors to cut it, and sometimes you might even cut your hand.
Make this zippered roti bread
Ikon put the cheese down and then he got hit
This is my bread, this is my trousers.
No, you are the saj roti bag, how is a child?
Abu Nasser, how can I get rid of this bug?
So when someone goes to work, he should tell his friend that he has eaten two sets.
Why didn’t the dough of the Noor Mountains hospitals go to them yesterday?
I know I’m asking you why she didn’t go yesterday.
The story, Your Highness, is that the bakers and the supervisors who oversee the dough are the ones responsible.
Reply later to the bakers
That’s what happened, sir.
What are you doing? You’re just yelling at him like that.
He’s sitting there with all this nonsense about football and stuff and he’s ruining my work.
You know your son loves football.
What’s wrong if a few employees from the company take them for entertainment?
You have four hundred employees in the company, so what are you taking?
These eleven people are considered the main players.
And above them, after that, he took four reserves and two administrators, but he only took seventeen.
The team's media spokesperson
I made this story up about these poor people.
But I’m doing okay until I develop, even though the fans, i.e. the audience, are considered the most important player on the field and the twelfth player.
Let him enjoy it, they give it to him, they put it in front of him and he is happy.
And we are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now, when he told you that he wanted to play football first, what did you do for him?
He listened to your advice and obeyed you.
We didn’t do anything.
Now that he has brought a few employees, he makes them play in front of him, watches them, enjoys them, and then you come and ruin his mood.
What he said is that he doesn’t hire employees.
Even if some of your people need employees, give them a few, it’s okay.
Important bakers
Oh, my God, may God guide you, why did you take the important bakers after it happened?
The second time you hire employees, tell me.
No, no, let Hamdi review this transaction with me.
Hamdi is in the hospital.
Why doesn’t anyone belong to you, may you live long?
I finished my shift and I’m going out to ride my car.
Listen to you, Nasser, may God prolong his life, he is calling you.
I walked on it.
The goalkeeper who plays with us told me that we couldn’t find him and we have an important match tonight.
Qayil Mayshino, fetch us a goalkeeper, we’ve reached the stadium.
The cat said, "What do you wear, goalkeeper?"
I have never played football or held a ball.
This is the situation
What cannot be tolerated
And tomorrow we will find you a job to work in. Come on, no more wasting time, no football, no nonsense.
Let me tell you
Dad, you want me to dissolve the team and cancel it, right?
Yes, that's right.
Okay, God willing, I’ll do it for you, but I have a request.
It’s a shame, it means the team will be eliminated and the final match will be ruined.
Lalala in this one, he and the boy have a right to it.
I don't understand.
Zain, congratulations on your victory.
Congratulations, Professor Nasser, on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
See, I prepared the team physically, mentally and psychologically, and thank God the coach did not fall short.
Inside your mill
Congratulations to all of you and the party is just as I promised you.
I say your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he's embarrassed and being polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, peace be upon the Prophet. We want to congratulate you on your team's great victory, the International Bakeries team.
With this great victory
May God bless you. May God bless you. No, no, no.
A picture without a cloak. Moment by moment, hold on a little.
No no
There is a mistake in wearing the cloak.
There is no doubt that your patronage, great interest and creative ideas played a major role in this victory.
The coach's plan
But in the final, he played in a 5-5-3-2 formation.
As a great athlete, you know that changing the plan confuses the players, but the Bakery team was not confused and played a great game.
The coach's plan
As the first athlete at International Bakeries, what advice do you have for the players, Abu Nasser?
Until the end of time
Hello hello
May you live long
He greeted them, with them was Hamoud Sultan.
May God bless them, they honor us by having dinner with us, right?
Dinner is here.
May God bless you, Abu Abdulaziz.
is considered a contribution to the private sector
Team Toh
Be jealous of us, come on.
No, I mean
Abu Abdulaziz
The agent of the machines that we use in the factory
Did you see how?
This is the one you wanted to get to know.
The ball introduced me to him and I hinted to him.
I told him, ya Abu Abdulaziz.
You have always been far away from hatred.
What does it have to do with you?
As far as I know, the ball is in his lap. I see it between me and him, about fifty centimeters away, which means I'm close to it.
Abu Nasser hasn’t arrived yet.
No, by God, he didn’t come today either.
In a seminar on sports injuries, he is the platinum sponsor and must be present.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I saw the building behind the bakery that he was going to turn into a workers' residence.
Hello, he is drowning in football.
As we have accustomed you, dear viewers, before every match, we meet one of the symbols of sports and talk to him.
This man is the one from whom the bakery team draws inspiration for his great ideas.
How is the International Bakery team doing? We heard that you are undergoing a comprehensive development process.
It means that you have to work in these offices and endure this hardship.
A trivial amount, i.e. after all this effort I’m only getting one million dollars?
No, man, relax a little, relax.
It was your fault, Heidi, not mine, brother Shaheen.
It's my fault
What’s wrong? Did I make a mistake?
But you didn’t tell me that the players are wanted in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf reach incredible levels.
The player who got two hundred thousand.
Here in the Gulf, they take it for three or four million dollars.
Understand me, Mr. Masoud, how?
The fax is stable from me here.
And I saw him in front of me.
I’m telling you again, my father bought four new players for the team, in addition to the new shipment that includes four players.
Look at this, what is this? This is amazing. He puts Billy and Ronaldinho in his pocket. All of this is in his pocket.
It says eight thousand.
Right, right, dad, but this is the price, may God bless you, it was set by a Turkish club.
In the Emirates, they want it for 700 million and 200 thousand.
Look at me
Okay, can we check the goods?
Surely in front of you
The man ducked.
That’s all.
No, no, I give you everything guaranteed.
You are fat, Mashallah. This is good, you are fat.
This is the basis, this is the right basis.
The systole muscle
This muscle is the most important thing for a player. If it gets damaged, he is useless.
You did your best.
Let the driver bring them to us at the club. The robot, the robot, what did I say? I said the robot.
What the hell?
Come on, Hamdi, let’s go.
Congratulations, congratulations.
This is God, may he protect you, buds.
Yes, I bring them from the jungles of Africa. What can we do for them?
We feed them, we raise them, we fatten them up, and then we destroy them in the stadiums.
I didn’t ask for anything, I didn’t ask for your nose, take it, dad, take it. Do you have space in the car or should I carry you in the pickup?
It wasn’t the day he saw them pressuring us.
The attacker is coming down to me
I don't know what that means.
The defender descends
Cashew Macacacani Lulululu This is what is supposed to come down
Our coach is a novice.
Inshallah on Mars
Neither Spain, God willing, nor Mars.
I don’t like the way he reads the course of the match.
This walks on a line
The game has its own rules.
God willing, in two days
Raise your voice, let it be heard
This program was born in Spain.
He doesn’t want to believe that the coach is an idiot who doesn’t understand football.
Listen, listen to what Mitsu is saying. Go ahead.
He knows that the attacker of the struggle, Silolotekaouawa, was born in the penalty area, as Ahmed Al-Tayeb said, and he knows where to position himself.
Don't let anyone mess with your head.
Stay away from me.
And I know how to deal with this coach.
Why did the team decline? Why?
What is supposed to be happening now should make the International Bakery Center coach's team think about changing the game in the middle of the match.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
The player Takulamakakukolalalalalo doesn't belong here. He needs to move to the place where he always plays.
The coach's word is the truth, I will change.
Kokunale Hopuway Malalu withdraws
Inshallah Inshallah Inshallah
What the hell is going on in the stadium?
What is happening now should not exist between the team manager.
Team coach
If there’s anything they’re going to postpone, it’s until after the game.
Now all the people are watching, and all the people are seeing, and the thing is in front of the camera.
The ball is in the goal. A fourth goal for the success team.
He scored the fourth goal and he is the star of today's match.
This coach is stubborn.
He said that’s it, Uncle Bou Nasser doesn’t want you as a coach for his team.
And what else do you want?
I'm watching the game on TV, and you stay on the bench. Do what I say.
My son, don’t do this to yourself, it’s not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how can we play without a coach?
What is your father doing?
That’s it, Rashed.
What’s wrong with you, my daughter? You broke my heart. Tell me, what’s wrong with you?
Divorce me, mom, divorce me.
How did he divorce you? How did he divorce you?
I don’t know, mom, I don’t know.
How can he divorce you? You’ve only been married for a month.
I swear to God, Mom, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t.
It means that I will divorce you on the way back home.
Oh, my mother, oh
Mom, I swear to God, I don’t know, he suddenly came in and told me to get up and go to my parents’ house.
I asked him why, he said, “That’s it, I’m divorcing you, you’re divorced.”
I’m alone and I swear I don’t know what’s going on.
A couple gets divorced, and people talk about us.
I'm with you
I swear I’ll tell you.
I didn’t even know he divorced her until you told me just now.
Stay seated for a minute and I’ll come to you.
Her high morals
Barcelona Saturday
Abdullah's eye view
Yanni returned with a tear on his cheek.
He says, “Mom, I left Barcelona.” He really loves this team and respects it a lot.
Is she insulting him and hurting his feelings?
He told me, "Mom, I left Barcelona." I said, "That's it, what do you want with it? Let it go, divorce it, I'll get you another one."
I told him that your daughter got divorced because she left FC Barcelona.
But just because of this reason, he will divorce her? Are you serious?
I don't care about you.
Is it easy to hurt feelings?
A wife questions her husband's loyalty
I can’t believe what I’m hearing.
We don’t need a girl who doesn’t respect international teams.
This time she made fun of Messi.
Problems arise between couples, and we are supposed to
Unit replacement A
Girls are a lot, and I have a thousand girls that I wish for.
Listen to me, daughter of the people.
But that’s it, I don’t want to hear anything else.
And please, I told you not to come in. This is my son, and I know him well.
We told you not to come in.
I’m going to get angry at you now.
Don’t worry, mom, don’t think about it.
Unit replacement A
But why are you still upset?
But whenever I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
My love is absent
Poor thing, what’s wrong with her?
This girl's name is Mona.
I got married for a month and got divorced.
And if I tell you what happened and why I called, you will die laughing.
We have an agreement with him, we want what’s best for you.
What interest could there be, Mom, with someone who divorced his wife because of a football team?
The hairdresser knew them and told me the whole story. Mom, don’t get me involved with him, I don’t want to get stuck with someone like that.
But you just stopped listening to these hairdressers who have nothing to say.
Do you know how? Tell them that I don’t agree.
Let her get confused and say whatever she wants.
Good morning
I told her, I told her, my daughter, don’t cut off your livelihood.
If it is destined to happen, it will happen, even if it is a matter of livelihood.
But she will cut off her livelihood and ours with her.
This building
He doesn’t say no to me.
I will leave this bad hairdresser with her stories and talk to God.
They just spread rumors when they hear them.
You don’t have to worry about it.
Understand it and tell her not to close the door of good that opens for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You’re not sane. You really believe that the man divorced his wife because she left Barcelona?
Leave the nonsense and don’t become crazy.
I won't let the opportunity slip out of my hand.
And they taught her that she was the reason and that there was something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen to me, girl, don’t let go of the guy with two towers.
What is this, two towers?
But they are about to discover that they are two towers.
That is why his father, Shaheen, was called Abu Barjeen.
May God bless you
Oh nonono, sweet, thank you, merci.
No, thank you, I don’t want it, please.
Long live you, they have already asked and you have signed, and the money has already been spent.
You are not focused, and it is clear that you have a lot of concerns. It’s been a month, sir.
That was the first wedding month, now it’s a new wedding, Abdullah got divorced.
Before that, he was married and divorced.
Yes, this is the third wedding now.
That’s all there is to it, brother. Just give it a little push.
Oh Real, this is a difficult generation.
The opinion and the other opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, oh mother.
Mom, don’t forget that I put your fur coat on top of the suitcase.
So you can take it in your hand while you're on the plane.
I swear you went down to London.
Yeah dad, you’re not planning to go to London, are you?
Hello mom
Okay, that’s fine.
Because she will come with us and do some shopping at the same time.
Malaysia Malaysia
Malaysia, take the fur with you
Goodbye, Mom.
What’s wrong with her now?
And what do I know?
This is right in front of you, ask her, I don’t know what’s going on.
What’s wrong with you, dad? What happened?
I did my best in it, I didn’t give it any attention.
Who is this girl?
She’s supposed to be on her honeymoon, she should be looking at you with her eyes, serving you with her hands and feet.
Is it possible that she is sitting and you are pouring water?
No, and don’t pick up that cup next to you and drink from it.
He is not well-mannered.
Jan said to her: I am the one my mother gave birth to and she is the one who gives me water with her hands.
What’s wrong with her like that?
She looks very sad.
And who is the one with her?
This girl's name is Mashael.
Poor thing, she got pregnant on her honeymoon.
You won't believe it if I tell you what happened.
May God bless you, auntie. Thank you.
Tell your aunt that your aunts are asking about her.
But I don’t know where my mom booked for us.
Hello, hi mom.
Mom, where did you book for us?
Because she wanted to go there with us.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Why did you do this at the airport and why did you take the kids?
What happened between them?
Now you’re asking me, how would I know what’s going on between them?
By God, his absence
Where is my mother?
She is in her room talking to this crazy man.
Now you're telling us that she has been calling him for two days and his phone is off.
She only just caught it.
This is us waiting to see what he’s up to.
He said that he was annoyed, the boy was tired from being outside and wanted to come in to rest.
Mom, every day I tell her, "If you bring me apples, peel them," but she doesn't peel them. Every day she annoys me.
Then you know I don’t like apples with their skin.
What happened to the apple that peeled off?
I’m telling you
You are divorced.
And once if necessary
Go, my beloved
I would sacrifice myself for you.
Oh, Mom, Manira, what happened?
What’s wrong with you? Why are you still upset?
Call three times and tell him you are divorced.
Shut up, for God's sake.
I don’t know, my mother saw me at the disco in Spain and then she told him.
He really doesn’t have a story.
Yes, he really doesn’t have a story.
You dance for her two or three dances.
Then, may he never live who divorces my daughter. He is not worthy of her.
How can I release you?
Come here, where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to cool off with that shameless guy.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Decorated with gold, rubies, coral and diamonds
And the daughters of people are a toy for you and your son.
They don’t even have mothers who would burn for them and understand them.
You are making fun of the ones you have.
Shoot them however you like.
I didn’t drink your water, let it go, let it go, let Barcelona go, let it go, let it go
The one who is going to a nightclub
No shame, no modesty.
Deputy Minister, born Arab and Muslim
He accused his reputation and the reputation of his children.
Don't move, stay still.
Have a little humanity in you.
Parental right
There is no one who would sell a piece of land like this again.
Abu Saqr took it from my father by force.
Why did your father sell it?
May God guide you, Abu Saqr. If he sets his eyes on someone, he can say no to him.
Leave it to God, man.
Welcome, welcome, come in, come in.
Come on, come on
Hey, Abu Saad, how is your project going?
Put your hand on it
You said last week that you were going to go to his office.
I told you that if you want your project to succeed, you need to get your act together and grease the wheels.
Bu Saqr, the old millionaire
Whoever eats in this world will eat.
This is not a problem, brother, we will eat it, we will fill it up, and we will stuff its belly. The problem is how we will reach it.
You need to know Bu Saqr's key so that the doors can open for you.
He was with him during the Umrah and greeted him several times.
You don’t need to know anything, as long as you spray it, you’ll get through it, but you need to know the right opportunity.
I’ll tell you what the secretary said to me first: Abu Saqr is waiting for you for dinner.
I turned on the ignition and came.
This is Abu Saqr, may God protect him, he makes dinner every day.
One Rial
He loves the gathering and being with his friends.
How beautiful it is to sit in this farm at the end of the night.
Yes, long live you, this is Bu Nasser, the car agency behind the complex, it belongs to him.
May you live long, I would like to get to know you.
Get a license
It was my son who got the license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
May God bless you.
Abu Saqr, may you live long
I asked you, don’t refuse me, say yes.
Just say "Tam" (done), long live you.
A gift from me to him
And whoever delivers you, do not reject me.
My affairs are messed up
So, is it normal that you met him and told him what you wanted?
You still don’t become a fool.
It’s okay, Abu Nasser.
Explain to me how you did it, what did you do?
I was served by circumstances.
And we were sitting with him
His son Saqr has a good driving license.
I have a falcon as a gift.
If you have a car
manageable
Come on, come on, lend him your ear.
So it happened.
He got out of the hospital.
I had an operation to remove my tonsils.
And he will definitely make dinner.
The boy deserves to be safe, may you live long, Salaam.
Reward and health, reward and health. God willing, he will not see any harm. God willing.
We met at the rosary shop.
I think, God willing
Oh, Real, we’ve started to forget how old we are.
They told me again that the room next to us was where your son Shaheen was, and he left.
I said I’d come back and visit you.
I congratulate you, Abu Salama Shahin.
You are a good person, God bless you. Listen, Your Highness, you won’t leave without having dinner with us.
I'm in the mood for it.
You just say "done" before
On the occasion of our dear son Shaheen's discharge from the hospital
The tower I have on the corniche
Okay, done.
Oh, Mom, don’t be stubborn.
I don't like business and I don't have any inclination towards it.
Whoever gets to start a business in this time without capital is lucky.
In the agency of vehicles and loaders, but he just says he points.
Love comes from God, and people love you because of your father's love.
Even the university
All the doctors love your father and respect him.
And three-quarters of them are with him every night in the majlis.
May God protect your father, everyone loves him, you just have to point.
Oh, Mom, people take loans from banks to start a company or a business.
I’m sitting in the assembly.
Rental shop opening
Something new, that's it.
This is a falcon that I saw with my own eyes yesterday. He gave them to me and said, "Sample, try them."
I just got their agency yesterday.
See how
And then he told me, “Mom, all the merchants love me.” May God make His creation love you, oh Lord.
Yes, long live you.
I’m on my way to the office now.
I saw a new supermarket.
They are preparing it.
I really liked it.
I don’t know who it belongs to.
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Saqr, congratulations.
May God bless you
In the name of God, in the name of God.
What is it? A partner comes in and takes it cold and chilled.
You are now able to say no.
Okay, what’s the story?
What else does he say?
Shower with him
You don’t even know who your father is.
Whoever doesn’t love his father
I told him, I am Qasim, a friend of Abbas. He said, you have something to do with the pussy.
I have a bakery, thank God, and I make a living from it.
I don’t like the name, lala.
What I noticed
No, brother, the name is not good.
Okay, that’s a good name for Iranian bread.
I found it in the Grand Bread.
Qasim Khalas, we call it Grand Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you
Peace and mercy of God be upon you, O long-lived one.
Excellent, excellent. Is there anything you need? Do you want anything?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
I’m telling Iyad that this is our new employee.
She sent her car for repairs, God bless you, and came to take my car because she is a marketing representative at a marketing company and cannot do without a car.
You might still need your car.
No, no, I don’t need the car today, actually.
Come on, it’s okay.
This is the age of science, knowledge and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid that a person must be armed in his article, whatever the article is.
Well done, Dr. Sami.
May you live long
Study and study
You are calling us dogs.
No lessons, no trade, no economy.
He never read a book, not even a newspaper. I never saw him holding a paper in his hand, even once in his life.
You all know who the falcon is today.
I didn’t even want to get you into this business field, but
Uncle Bou Nasser is alive and well, he is right in front of you.
Who remembers him?
But there are people who are naturally born for business, they love business.
You are right, doctor.
God willing, Shaheen, you will see your brother again.
God is generous, God willing.
Now you're talking
Of course, this depends on upbringing.
You’ve done more than enough, doctor.
To be honest
How did a falcon, who hated trade so much, develop such a great economic sense so easily?
If they counted a hundred billionaires in the world today, he would be one of them.
Do you know, Abu Saqr?
Saqr was chosen by Knight for the Market Medal
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser?
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser was admitted to the hospital.
A source once told me that you heard that Saqr, the son of Bu Saqr, wants to take the car agency from his father.
The agency flew away from you
A world that is never satisfied
It was his father who helped him enter the market.
And that's what made him open his eyes to business.
Frankly, the doctor says his condition is very difficult.
But that’s not how it works.
Nothing is impossible
I don’t care if he’s injured or supported. I’m telling you to divorce her. Divorce her means divorce her.
That’s how it is in the 21st century.
And we meet, dear viewers, with one of the men of goodness and generosity in this country.
A man who knew the right way to help the needy and the deprived.
Of course, we have with us the founder and owner of Saqr Charity Association.
Of course, if you had told us about this association, Your Highness.
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to achieve, of course, for the world and for everyone.
Without any hypocrisy, favoritism, or desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds, we are preparing to deliver.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
May God bless you, long live, and may there be more people like you.
My wife and I left the house.
But the madam spends half an hour opening her new project.
I’m waiting for her
It doesn't matter.
I really love you guys, I love being with you, I have a lot of fun.
And provide for my children.
All my life
You seem to want to waste my time.
And beyond the problems

Come on, guys!
That’s how it is in the 21st century.
That’s how it is in the 21st century.
Whoever wants to go diving, diving requires effort.
I want a man
Souq Waqif is alive
You deserve it, you deserve it. Congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you.
Mashallah, everyone loves you, Shaheen. Love is from God.
If I say a word, you just say "done".
Tomorrow, on the occasion of getting his driver’s license, my son Shaheen will go to the agency and choose the nicest and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The breeze blew upon us from the branches of the valley.
Oh, love has entered, love has taken me to my country.
Hi Fadi
Anoud, how are you?
No no no no no
You just told me that the dress will be ready in a week, but yesterday you sent me a message saying it will be ready in ten days. You’re so boring.
You want him, Crystal wants him to take a little more water.
And now, God willing, she will start talking to Anoud and ignore me.
Why, how much light do we have?
Don’t be sad, the whole world is not sad, and Anoud is not sad either.
What else do you want, Fadi? They are already jealous of you.
Oh, how beautiful is their talk, they are jealous of me, not like our people who are jealous of you.
The important thing is that you don’t forget the topic.
My dress is ready.
Please, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I will come to you next week to pick up the dress. Okay, goodbye.
How can I help you?
Just send me the dress home.
No, I didn’t like it.
Mashallah, I went to Fadi’s shop today, it’s a good business and the girls are coming and going.
Thank God, we succeeded in this project.
What happened after that?
Bounasser is my cousin
What’s wrong with him?
Look at the envy
We’ve never heard how this bankrupt project will get the money for the shower.
I broke it, it sucks
And when I start trading
Are you sure?
Listen, Haji.
And God willing, you intend to keep quiet about it.
Seven in the morning
YY They will bring you breakfast
Don't give up, I had breakfast.
I just wanted to say one thing to you.
I heard that you
I'm planning to start a business.
But where am I and where is this talk? May God guide you, my cousin.
Designing women's clothes is not like designing something else.
Who told you?
I have business money.
No, no, no, no, no, just me.
Do you want advice? Do you want to see? I’m here, meaning if you want me to help you with something.
Okay, okay, cousin, okay.
Okay, forgive me, I’m leaving.
Here you go, sir.
It’s the first time you’ve told me if you want more.
Come on, Fadi, tidy up the place, it’s crowded, I can see.
The store is not enough
I thought you said you were going to take the shop next to you. Go on, take it, God willing.
I wish
The shop next to you is a merchant.
There is a guy called Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi, other than your cousin Bu Nasser.
No, there isn’t.
I’m coming from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name in a transaction with a friend of his called Essam. He has his papers.
Designing women's clothing
Sure
I saw the lease agreement and his name was written on it.
What’s wrong with her? What’s wrong with her? What’s wrong with her?
What’s wrong with it? What’s wrong with it? What’s wrong with it? It looks bad.
What ails your sick heart?
Both of my projects are successful.
I said I wouldn’t ruin it for him.
This is an open market for everyone.
Sh. Sh. Abu Nasser
Take care of what he says.
And I feel your pulse, I tell you what they say, you're planning to start a business.
Dad, I didn’t lie to you.
Seek secrecy in your affairs to get them done.
Go to hell, you and your stuff.
But what can you do?
Dad, this is sustenance, everyone takes his sustenance.
Stretch out your hand
You are the people I expect this from.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh, that’s too much.
In Pitby, you reached out and touched me.
Open to all
You are brothers
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Get a Lebanese designer
I am a woman, ask me.
Know our women well, they die for Lebanese men.
Madam, this is being repeated to you. No, no, this is unique, there is nothing like it in all of Doha.
Wow, Madame, this suits you, and this sweet talk, and this piece that they sell for thirty or forty thousand pounds.
Any such thing
Do you remember the closet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter?
Madam, I will make you a wardrobe that doesn’t exist anywhere in Doha.
You want to succeed
What exactly is it?
Why don’t you know?
Start of customer data
What do you think, uncle, shall we go somewhere else?
Oh no, no, Fadi!
And then they play by themselves at that time.
It means we lost. No.
We need to face it.
We force our customers to come back.
Okay, are you going to pay?
What I pay for it
I am ready to do anything.
But the important thing is that he doesn’t beat me.
This is the dress you chose, it turned out to be sixty thousand riyals.
Sure, without ties to those present in the text.
This is a gift from the designer, me.
And I put a crystal pill on it, there are only fifty pills like this in the whole world. This is a very special pill among them.
There is definitely no discount, our prices are known worldwide.
No, definitely not. Who would do such a thing?
Wait a minute, Madame, what happened? What happened?
Look at us, Saad, look at us
This is what they do.
They slaughtered us, we don’t have any customers left at all.
Heidi, this is a war, ya Abu Nasser.
And we are not going to be silent about them.
We must fight them the way they fight us and respond to them.
I’ll take a loan from the bank tomorrow.
And wage war against them, and show you [His] might in them.
It’s not the desert that brought you here, Abu Nasser.
Check out the ad
Check out the ad I posted.
We’re giving away two evening dresses for free with every wedding dress.
He has four evening dresses, four with each wedding dress.
And we have a quarter-page ad.
Jovi wrote half a page.
I don’t know what he’s up to.
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
They haven’t had a single customer in their shop for six days.
No, and today in the afternoon I have good news for you, they didn’t open it once, they closed it.
And if you hear that he has put his shop up for sale
I will slaughter him, I will slaughter him.
They can’t even sit down outside.
Okay, so drink your juice and go to him.
I’m here, God, where am I and where is he? This is a problem.
You are an enemy who has something against me.
This is someone who deliberately wants to spray the place with this smell, God bless you.
And these are chemicals
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You are the sons of a great uncle, not little kids who fight like children.
It’s night time and there’s a bad smell in the shop. Is this fair?
I didn’t spray anything, this is your smell.
About the mistake
You wrote a pledge to the police about yourself.
I don't care.
This time I am
He has a diabolical plan for him.
Without anyone having anything on me
No, by God, everything is normal.
This is what confuses me.
I don’t know what’s going on, this is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our shop.
You are the one who made me show my face in that second place. May God guide you.
What did the doctor say?
I see the shop is whistling, no customer has entered it.
I don’t know what to say, it’s like they’ve cast a spell on him.
Women and girls don’t come near the shop at all.
You mean the designer Saad Wahsh made a magic mold?
It’s not far-fetched, don’t rule anything out these days.
Magic exists, and that's after that.
Zain, is he sleeping now or is he awake?
Go in, brother, go in. I’m afraid the ceiling will fall.
You lost, Sultan, you lost.
I don’t know what he did, the dog.
He is a beast.
Calm yourself, brother, don’t get upset with me.
I don’t know what he did.
My lover taught me how to do it. His friends say they started collecting money for him and paying off his debts.
The designer who has
I am Lebanese.
You told him, you told him.
You don't know where he went, do you?
The stars, the stars, the stars are there, and these extras play their roles.
Call Real again, maybe he has a situation.
Oh, oh, Uncle Ahmed!
What’s up, Uncle Ahmed? You’re sitting here and leaving the hole to keep making noise for me. What should I do? Where are the extras you said you’d bring today?
Get away from me, it’s better for you. I called him and my head hurt even to ask Professor Abdullah.
First of all, don't shout because we are actors, we want to relax a bit, we want to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man called more than once in front of me, calm down.
What, what, what are you saying, Professor Abdullah? What are you saying?
Mr. Abdullah, what should I do? This crazy woman will finish the scene and then come after me.
Come on, guys, come on, sweethearts, next one, next one.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Professor, we want to finish, but the extras who are supposed to film the scene are still not here.
You don’t want anyone to yell at you, right?
Do your job calmly and without shouting.
And this is our situation, we’ve been screaming since morning, we want to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think? I’ll arrange a scene like this for you until I find an actor who can play the role right, God willing.
He really wants to do one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, come and look at the pictures.
But if you're not ready, I'll call it off today.
Above the youth, oh God
What can I tell you? There is a Filipino who is suitable.
You don’t know Bu Walid, he’s always on Evercash, he always says he wants someone who inspires the cabaret to be from the cabaret and Qatari.
Sir, we will put a ghutra and a ‘al on him, he won’t be visible.
Alaa, are you serious? You just want to, you guys are just like boiled eggs. This is a production. Respect people's feelings, father. People's intelligence.
It’s because Alaa has put everything on your head. Distribute the tasks and you will feel better.
Focus so that we can think. Think with me, Reem. Maybe you remember someone from the group like this.
Who am I?
Remember Ahmed, there was one in Frij Aslita named Saud Akhnar.
Saud Akhnar, no one else
Saud Qawati said
The director tells you he wants a rich guy and she tells him cans.
My love, he is just an extra in the end, meaning you bring in a rich and prestigious person and give him an extra role.
But a little makeup, Reem, and wear a clean cloak and dress, and a fancy car.
God willing, it will work.
How are we going to get to him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Saïd Ouaati
I’m fed up with this
E E E Aho Aho
Yes, he did. Thank you, dad, you did your best.
Now, how about it, mom? There’s no other ghutra except this one that my uncle brought from his trip.
Dad, you only have that one that you wear.
Dad, it’s in the closet under my clothes.
The group, Mom, is waiting for me at the door, complaining.
God, God, may He help you, dad.
It means that today I will see you and they will film you on TV.
Oh, Mom, they said that I will appear on TV as one of the big guys.
Sit down, you dog.
Come on, Ash, this is spitting on you.
Spray spray
Haj yama
Quickly, mom, thank God, now.
God willing, dad.
No, God willing, God willing, but they will give you money.
May God help you, God willing.
Oh God, pray for me.
I brought you Saud Qawati. Saud has a laptop.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.
This is not Aboud, the son of Fatima Aboud.
Hello hello
Hello Saud
This is the one who will do the scene.
Yeah, God willing, God willing, he will do a good role. Calm down and do well so they can give you a longer role. Okay?
Tell your mother how she is.
That’s not the one that was taken at the first corner.
Shame, shame, Ark Ahayeh Saud.
You started wearing glasses.
The old slave
I haven’t changed, I regret nominating you.
The guy they brought in to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
Oh, come on, dad. Hello, hello, hello.
This is our way out, Mr. Ghafel Faadel, to whiten the face.
The most important thing is that you are not afraid of the camera.
Brother, I only fear God.
Just relax and listen to the director's instructions. Whatever he tells you, say "Inshallah".
My brother, my brother, please, you will play the role of one of the cabaret people, one of the rich people. Do you understand or not?
Come here, boy, come here, boy.
I'm talking to you.
This is too light, you know. The role requires someone heavier.
Everything is acceptable to some people.
Ask me why I wear the hijab.
Dad, this is the one who is in charge of filming. Listen to me, I’ll take you to the makeup room now and teach you the role.
Shame, shame, shame.
Come here, please.
We got to know her again.
No no no, you have it, you have it.
I came and God brought you, please come in, please come in.
My teacher, the car you want for the scene is ready.
Saud is cleaning everything up and fixing it.
Any mistake we make, we will do it again, and the assistant director is here to listen to you and reassure us.
Imagine yourself as the oud merchant.
You say that
I’m telling you, be patient, don’t rush. I didn’t expect that from you, Abu Abdulaziz. You’re Abu Abdulaziz, speak up.
About our rights
Sweet and know
Come on, brother, come and clean my teeth.
He cleans and completes the full name: Bu Abdulaziz Falh Al-Marzouq. Nice.
Sweet, continue, continue and consider.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Why don’t you just divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced. She is beautiful, she is beautiful.
It’s very nice, continue and consider yourself not taken.
Why don’t I tell him to fuck off?
You are perfect. May God bless and greet the Prophet. He is honey.
Salt cleans my teeth.
How? Why? What?
Sir, the owners of the house are disturbing us and they want the hall, so we’ll film the scenes in the hall first and then we’ll film the things outside.
What do you mean they don’t want it?
Yes, they want to, but they’ll delay it a bit. They’ll film another scene and we’ll come after them, God willing.
Let them come to you here.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
May God bless your morning, long live you.
Hello, who are you, boy?
I am Salem Bushouai Al-Shouai, may you live long.
And the blessings and the blessings of the people are known.
You deserve it.
I’m so angry, I’ll come back after I get my lips done here.
Come on, brother, those with weak noses now.
I wanted myself
If it was someone else, they would have died laughing.
I would like to eat
Hello mom
My mother is sick now, I have to go to her quickly, man.
You’re going out dressed like this?
I can tell you that my mother is sick and tired, but he says
Listen to me, you can go like this, but when I call you, you have to come back quickly.
And I and he, we can’t give you the location.
Okay, okay, I’ll look for a taxi, brother.
Taxi? If you looked here and spent a year looking for a taxi, you wouldn’t find one.
You know, we rented this car for the scene.
Since she’s standing there, go for it.
Yes, please, brother, I wish you would give me the keys. My mother is sick. Please give me the keys.
In the car
I want a chair.
Wait, I’ll send you a chair right now, right now, oh sheikh.
I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you.
I’m telling you my mother is tired, by God, she’s in the car, I need a chair, God bless you.
Where is Mered inside the car?
Oh oh, dad, dad, what’s happening
Shut up or speak, look at yourself while you're silent.
Hello
There’s nothing wrong, but your aunt, my mother, has an asthma attack. Come on.
Let them highlight the bed.
Okay, okay.
Don’t worry at all.
May God be sufficient for you, what have you done?
Thank God, Rasheed.
Free our son Rashed
Come with me, Mr. Rasheed, please.
Go with him, Mr. Rasheed.
I will take Mr. Rasheed and do what is necessary for him.
This is your Mamoun.
I’ll have the nurse come and check your hours and see what you’re drinking.
Here you go, Mr. Rasheed.
With your permission
We are waiting for a lot of snow.
No one is paying attention to us, mom.
Sir Snow wants to leak a cup of coffee cappuccino.
Oh, you’re not the first one. There’s a security guard at the hospital who has a Filipina girlfriend.
And who told you that I refuse?
But none of them gave me a face
Philosophers and no conditions
He doesn’t have a certificate, I don’t want your mother, what’s wrong with your mother? Go and find your friends.
There is a girl in the hospital that I like.
Oh, I didn’t give you my face, go find someone else.
The heart couldn’t bear it, it was attached.
Your brother studied medicine and fell in love. Do you believe it when I saw her?
This is a gift for Dr. Muhammad.
He he Snow in Ant
Let's go
I swear to God on Halaweh.
May you live long, auntie is in perfect health.
You are a professional actor, Saud. Come on, guys, who’s next? Come on.
Oh, how wonderful you are! See how they clapped for you and praised you.
Come on, now go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Hey, you good man, leave it and come and sign for me here first.
Yes, from today my name is Falih Al-Marzouq.
Leave that talk and write Saud.
Saud is dead.
From today, my name is Falih Al-Marzouq Bu Abdul Aziz.
May God bless you, my love.
One buffet
I did two
Until I heard one of the bride’s relatives say, “Oh my God, these people are so classy, I don’t think anyone can do what they did at the wedding.”
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Hey mom
I have to bring them something on the occasion of the engagement.
What is it, mom?
Look at your brother who is embarrassing us.
And it’s a shame, really, bring it
But it’s just enough for us to get by.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make us a laughing stock.
Tell me, what good thing did you see?
This type of free class is for high-class people.
Above average tariff
No, we want something unusual, something that not everyone can buy.
Forgive me, ma'am. Whoever doesn't know you is ignorant. You command, long live.
Just shut up, you don’t know anything.
I’m afraid the money I have won’t be enough.
Don’t embarrass us, go and withdraw money with the card.
Oh, oh, oh, this is so beautiful, it’s so classy, I swear.
Saleh Malaj yesterday
Salih Nasser
Okay, okay.
Good news, Abha, I’m coming to you.
They booked the small hall and the food for the baby.
Fairy Gibb
Al Lam Alal said what she said about the wedding of Beit Al-Sa’eed.
Surely all people say the same thing.
This is what scares me.
My sister, my love
I'm just sitting here, worried about money.
He doesn’t care what people say.
He wants to make us a laughing stock.
But I was supposed to bring us something that fits our budget and circumstances.
You know that some people borrow money and others sell their houses and cars just to have a lavish wedding and not let people talk about them.
You just stay out of it. The wallet that you wanted to embarrass us with is enough.
You yourself said that the manager liked the Chinese girl and took her home.
Zain, the bride's family said that you should choose the hall and the stage and prepare everything by yourselves.
And God willing, you want us to choose anything.
It doesn’t mean anything, but I’m saying that the place we went to just now is very reasonably priced.
This is the place that organized the wedding of the Abu Thahab family.
Someone used it before
To be honest, just once, by God.
I will marry the daughter of the long-lived Mubarak.
No, we don’t want anything used.
Abi Kosha, we are the first people in the world to use it.
You want to stand out
What do you have, Raoni?
This is the wedding tent, I’m entering Qatar for the first time.
Inspired by the information sura, i.e. Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and new
The price of the whole set including accessories is frozen.
Let me count it for you, but it’s not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, if we do it like this, our money won’t be enough. Everything is better, more luxurious and more distinctive. All this costs money.
Everyone does that.
Shut up, whoever delivers you
What are the errors?
Did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
We easily removed both of them, but the Noah's Ark wedding hall is more expensive by twenty thousand.
No, and why, may God have mercy on your parents, I say that the luxury couch is much better, to be honest.
Shut up, I don’t want Noah’s Ark.
These are the weddings and these are their costs, and we are considered average people, you know.
So, a room for 150,000 and a hall for 150,000, this is the one you booked, the Royal Hall, as you said.
We didn’t say it was witchcraft, but why the appearances? Everyone wants to look at the other and everyone wants to do better than what the other did.
The battle of appearances is only beneficial to wedding shop owners.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit us and lie to us.
I swear I know a friend who says his brother has a wedding shop.
The cage costs no more than two thousand riyals.
No, I can’t believe it, I hope her father will agree.
That’s it, stop it.
Just like other young people before you, they got married and acted.
Hello, your highness, long live you.
How are you?
I know you love to be unique.
And that's why I'm telling you.
For the first time, it comes to Qatar, designed by the international artist Peter Salmo.
Its agent's composition about the nine planets
From the solar system
With a little bit of Noah’s ship, something very beautiful comes out.
I’ve never seen anything like this before, you’re the first person in Qatar to use the nine planets.
That’s it, I’ve had enough.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now
So, salvation
May God reassure you.
You are welcome
It’s a lot of expenses, brother.
Anyway, I couldn’t manage to get all eighty of them.
All I could do was sixty thousand and twenty thousand, which I took from my brother.
You did your best, you did your best, may God help you, brother Fahd.
Come here, Fahd, come here. As long as we are boasting and showing off at the wedding, we are in a mess.
No appearances, no arrogance.
You will definitely get the cards you want.
God willing, we will start with the cards this week.
If our wedding turns out to be better than theirs
Mom, look at the cards your son is making for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to make wedding cards.
Mow Beit Amena went to Italy, designed the cards, printed them, and came back with Beit Amneera.
They went to France, even people who don’t have a lot of money go to Lebanon, they go to Lebanon and bring their cards.
This is how the country is, you want us to violate the law.
Where do you want to travel to, God willing?
We saw a lot of really cool cards.
It’s really expensive, but
But it’s unique and no one has done it before us.
Zari la mo hilo
I say gold is better because it shines.
Dude, if he can’t afford the wedding expenses
Why would he get himself into trouble in the first place?
Let’s leave behind all this arrogance and extravagance at weddings and the unnecessary losses.
The only ones who benefit from our mental illness are these hotels and party shops.
Poor guy is gone
Let me go and take him there, it’s a shame that he might not find anyone to take him.
Welcome to your destination
I didn’t do anything wrong, Nasser.
Dude, the bride’s family is supposed to support you.
But I'm just once, just once.
I mean, it doesn’t have to be a hall in a huge hotel like this.
And our daughter, we found her on the street, and the others are no better than her.
This is a problem, everyone is looking at everyone.
Who told you that I got married?
At least these people don’t have this kind of arrogance.
It’s all a simple party and the expenses are according to our means.
And then come on, man, these days people have wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheaper and less expensive
So you are not married to your countrywoman?
Forget to show me where
Araweg Aad
If I were to choose between Abdullah Rwaishid's wedding and Nawal's wedding
You look better than me.
I say my love
If the boy has Arwaishad’s number, give it to us so we can talk to him.
Okay, my love, you’ve done enough. Goodbye.
We had agreed on a DJ, mom, why did you change your mind?
Um Nsour's view is better than mine.
You forgot who she is and who we are.
Those who are less than us will become better than us.
The topic is not like that, mom, but as you can see, my brother Saleh is breaking my heart and we don’t want to put pressure on him.
I felt so sorry for him.
Wow!
It's my hospital, and which hospital?
I don’t know, it suddenly fell on us.
I heard this talk and then it fell on us.
He has no story, you can’t blame him after you prepared everything and people came, he says he doesn’t want a wedding.
He wants us to fail.
Here is what the doctor said.
He’s going to embarrass us, sister. He wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, only good will happen.
Don't burn her heart
Oh, mom, you are a man and you are the one who brings the money.
Soul soul wind her heart
If I told this to Abu Youssef, his heart would stop, I swear to God.
You know why the minister is still keeping Abu Youssef.
By the way, he was supposed to have retired three or four years ago.
There’s nothing wrong with it, he’s helping me.
No, you are not sane, by God.
You understood that I am his father now.
Let him go through the papers and records until you return the money.
This is called excessive cooling delay.
I don’t know why my soul spoke. Why are you afraid?
It’s not a big deal, and in the end I’ll return the money anyway.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The committed disciplined
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there is no other way.
I gave you the money after the audit.
And they leave their case to God, and they don’t audit me quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the pill, the pill, the pill.
I ate the whole pill, I ate it all.
Lala, God willing, we will be in the hall from 7:30 to receive the guests.
Lala, we’ll actually be there.
I’m going to throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all Doha.
A surprise
Okay, my love, Fatima, I want to talk to you.
I’m afraid for you, my son, they will envy you if you go to them like this in a cloak tomorrow.
Oh, mother, the length of the cloak is good.
Police are coming.
May God make it good.
Six police officers, you stay here, I’ll come to you.
May God be sufficient for you, Salah.
Your marriage is over
The cage of marriage is now replaced by the cage of prison.
They found the papers I was hiding for your loan. Now they’ve got it in their heads and caught me.
Why are you upsetting yourself?
You hear worse things than this.
Shengoul is back
A loyal and dedicated employee
Does he like his job? The ministry contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, out of his concern for his work, went to inquire about the materials.
He found it for four hundred thousand riyals.
It saves the ministry one million and six hundred thousand.
The minister will go and punish him. No, no, I don’t believe this talk.
Why don’t you believe it?
That’s Saad who arrived.
He must have the full news.
Kick him out of work
What is happening in the world? Where are the values?
Except that he told you to call his office manager.
He told him to let Hiddam take the place of Othman.
And that's it.
The daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
And Osman exposed them
No, no, no, this is not possible.
You are always surprised, Saleh.
Who does this company belong to?
Who has it
That’s how we became
What are you saying?
What about the poor employee Othman now? What is his fault?
His fault is that he is an honest and loyal employee.
Do you think the manager is in his office now?
He just left a moment ago.
What’s wrong with the world?
We will see strange shapes.
I agree with you, Othman doesn’t deserve it, but there’s nothing we can do about it.
It’s a sin, long live you, he has seven children and no passport.
He has been in this job for a long time now, where will he hit his head and where will he go?
Did you see what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister
I went to Othman’s office and worked with him. Poor Othman wanted to take his stuff, but I prevented him. I told him to go and I would send his stuff with the janitor.
Where is he now?
The scales have turned upside down, Othman.
This is the end
What God has willed has happened.
Praise be to God
God is generous, Othman. God will not leave you, God willing. Goodbye.
I hope nothing is wrong, your voice doesn’t sound normal.
I know, I know you are very sensitive.
I don’t feel like going to work anymore, I’ll just leave.
And I’ll have another chance to visit my mother and bring you the stuff.
I don’t want you to stay like this, upset.
What’s wrong with you? Why are you shouting at me? I’m your mother.
I’m not shouting, I’m asking you.
It’s normal, dad, for you to let your wife, your father, your brother ride with you.
The world has changed, where do you live?
Ashdarani, my mother
You are not sober
People are free The universe has become a small village Where do you live?
But plumb
Be modern and live the moment, don’t fall behind
Put the stuff down quickly, come on, stop talking. You’re just watching, come on, close it properly.
I hope nothing bad happened, Saleh, what’s wrong with you?
No, you’re not normal today.
So I shouted at the maid, even though she was not to blame.
You know that I had no choice, I swear.
No, I don’t feel like it.
So I can forget the disasters I’ve seen.
My love, there is no more.
Dad is a little angry today.
Something that makes us happy, may God prolong your life.
Thank you, thank you, you have done your best.
Work hard, diligently and persistently.
That's right, Salam.
The most important thing
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That's right, long live you.
Tell me, what good is an employee who doesn't take bribes?
It has no use.
That’s why I want all of you.
There is no place for us here for the loyal, the principles and the outdated values.
If I ever find out
He has no one to blame but himself.
We will not let anyone’s blame deter us from the truth.
That’s why I want you to cooperate with me.
And if you doubt
Notify me immediately
Thieves and sons of thieves, and of course our sisters are no better.
Noura, if one day she doesn’t take a bribe, she’ll steal from the government on her way home.
Mashallah, Mashallah, well done. This is what I expect from all of you. I don’t want it to be just her; I want all of you to do the same.
May God bless you.
That’s why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
You really know how to choose; you chose the right thief for the right place.
That’s it, Umm As’ud, that’s it. Don’t torture me any more.
I didn’t send you to prison.
But I ask God to protect me from Satan, who tempted me and made the trust seem good to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a real man with children.
What do you have to do with honesty and loyalty?
You have always lived as a thief and been comfortable.
You finally became a decent person.
Let me talk to your father.
Bear to repeat it again.
One who walks straight, bribes, steals, and lies, lives comfortably.
My father is in prison because all his money is haram.
Buss buss
This is not an outfit you wear.
We are a respectable family.
It’s not a shame for you.
Where is Tangier?
Why isn’t it exposed?
You have no shame, you have no decency and no shame.
I’m ashamed to wear my brother’s clothes.
These days, he is alone and ashamed.
What’s wrong with you, why are you shouting?
I wear what I produce, Jovi.
A respectable person alone would dress like this.
And God willing, you will walk in the street without showing any part of your body.
I had a hard time with her because she wouldn’t listen.
Or I’m not neglecting it.
He brought her those transparent clothes that don’t need anything.
Be careful if I see you one day wearing something below the knee
Whoever warns is excused.
We are coming, God bless you.
God willing, it’s just a scoundrel and a bum.
He looked at his father.
What you see in front of you
Honestly, it’s a good riyal. Where can we find something like it?
Don’t worry uncle, I’m black too.
And yes, the riyal is very good. My daughter Sarah is very dear to me and I care about her future.
Doesn’t that mean you’ve heard about it?
Thank God, Mashallah, her reputation is terrible.
I enter the house at three thirty in the morning.
It’s Mashallah, I enter at five o’clock in the morning.
Hello, hello, what is it?
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I see a father who doesn’t listen to his son.
Come on, dad, stop fooling around, start your car, I’m waiting for you.
My love, I love you.
I love you too, I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone.
Basically, basically, my father is here.
Where is he?
Azaqarti is just like my father, he is a liar and doesn’t give her anything.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Majid.
Abdulaziz doesn’t like that boyfriend who came before him.
Welcome, come in, welcome, it’s an opportunity, a weed.
And the Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians had not cut their nails.
as the State of Palestine has committed itself to do in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
The United Nations is generally meeting today to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the fingers of the Palestinian people.
If their nails are long or not
There was a condition that there should be nothing in Palestine that would irritate, hurt or draw blood.
The State of Palestine
I invite the whole international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make it out of cork.
And Alzatonat, ya Zalmeh.
We press the olives like this, we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call on the international community
By conducting inspections of the nails of Palestinians
And now we start the voting.
No, it doesn’t get to that point, no.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Saleh Saleh, what's wrong with you?
I dreamed of Abshno.
I dreamed of an upside-down world.
Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now, brother, what is the number of the school I will attend tomorrow?
I am a teacher, just like you.
Why didn’t my school change since I started teaching?
What character, brother?
But the problem is that his personality is weak.
By the way, the teachers who are with him are the ones who protested against him.
To that extent, my brother.
What we see is silent.
Then he went on to explain
It wasn’t supposed to be mayonnaise at all.
Brother, we’re not saying this to you to make you upset.
We’re telling you this because this is your last chance.
He told me that he accepted Rashid even though his personality is weak.
He is shaky and too kind.
Whatever this is, it’s a son of the country.
Why are you silent now, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you said is correct.
From tomorrow
Professor Rashid Al-Yadid
Professor Rashed
May God bless your tongue.
Forget it, that’s it.
And from tomorrow
What kind of justice is this? And then?
Here I am telling you
I am a teacher, I don’t like mistakes.
Imagine a boy came to you and said the same thing that the boy said to you in elementary school while the inspector was sitting.
Take your bag
Little by little, I broke the door.
One has learned from his mistakes.
From the first minute
Here I am telling you
I am nervous.
How am I?
Shut up, Zain.
He told me to shut up, you know.
I heard him
He said that Professor Rashed kicked me out.
Ava, he said, “Oh, that’s good, but I don’t want to see your face here in class.”
Our teacher did not recognize the boy
He was born
There is a teacher, Rashid, yes.
Here is what happened to you
Professor, is there a problem if he tells his father?
Okay, you still have a chance. Where do you see us as having a chance, sitting here?
You can find him sitting near the chairs.
Above the chairs
Chairs chairs al
And in the end, the son of Adam is a human being.
But you just yelled at me.
A quarter and fool around, fool me.
My father is traveling and will be back next week, and when he comes back I will tell him.
No, Abdul Rahman, and may God protect you.
We are a quarter of the raspberry ice cream, it is very delicious, you may not have tried it, it has a little acidity, it is really amazing.
Go and get it quickly.
All he’s afraid of is telling his father.
You said that his father was traveling.
I’m a woman traveler, my father is dead, my father is gone, they took his straw and told him to travel.
May God protect us, God willing.
He took his bag and gave it to him, gave him your phone number and told him that if he needed anything, he could call him, he is his friend.
Just that
But what?
You were the ones who told me.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
bathroom bathroom bathroom
Hey Rashed
Sleep, sleep, you sleep, it’s okay, sleep.
Teacher Abu Nasser, Teacher Nasser is in the bathroom.
One juice and
Come, come, come, come, give me
Come on, hurry up!
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That’s why I gathered you all here to hear your ideas about the party.
Does anyone guarantee it?
Oh my God, you have caused us problems. That’s him, he’s connected.
Three o'clock
Hello, the sugar is joking, I swear.
Faster, faster
Hello
Stand up for the inspector Sit down
Yes, order.
Hey teacher, come here, come here, teacher.
I’ve already upset him.
I’m not mocking you, man. I’m asking you if you’re done talking.
Did you finish it or not? Where is the teacher's authority? You are making a fool of yourself. You are insulting the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, that’s enough, that’s enough.
You raise your voice again
So I raise my voice, first of all you should know who this boy is the son of.
Faster, faster
Just two Arab women
Lala Arabibten, I want four, four, five cars, God's land is vast, go, go, go.
To be the owner of this neighborhood
Abu Nasser used to do this and he didn’t do that.
May God make it easy for him.
I am the manager here.
He is well known as Bou Nasser.
He gave all the teachers extra lessons.
But me
Who is the manager here?
You are the manager, may God bless you. What’s wrong with you?
Rilke's Descent
Put it on your head and sit on the chair, brother.
What does six mean?
There is no need, I swear, I swear, I really want to make you comfortable.
What is his name? What is it?
You’ve got it with you now
Respect yourself, it’s better for you, and you’ll take extra lessons whether you like it or not. Are you okay with that, or what?
What’s wrong with you? Get up, get up, get up, get out.
Okay, God willing, we will go out.
How are you, we told you, you son of a man.
We need to stop him in his tracks.
Wait a minute, guys, wait a minute.
Don't blame us, Abu Salmeen.
Oh, Bonaif, you are the head of the neighborhood and you must put a stop to this.
I am not my father's son.
I will show it to you, I will.
Hurry up hurry up
Take care, may you live long.
Mashallah, when did you buy this new car?
You are the one who didn’t believe me.
He trimmed his mustache and his face turned red.
I swear I didn’t know it was him when he came to us. I only knew it was him when he spoke, from his voice.
You know that we passed by there a week ago.
This means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
This magic fish will tell you the secret that it brought up from the bottom.
I told you that from the first day.
I’m explaining the map, but I don’t hear any sound.
We do not
Respect yourself
After I replied to you, go away, get out, come on, get out, get out.
As soon as your appointment as a minister is announced, I will immediately look for a good job for you.
Okay, come on, don’t tell me to come and take this job.
No, give me some options for this job and I will choose the most suitable one.
My brother, the minister
I swear I didn’t feel comfortable with the calls I received.
Mashallah, everyone is congratulating.
What do they say, mother? May God destroy you.
This is normal. Every minister automatically employs his friends and his people.
Don’t worry about it from this side. It was nice to meet you. See you.
You know, of course, that I will become a minister.
Verchonye dehan seer
Khair Beyna Kanaz Kanaz Beyniftah Lana
Back to earth
Come on, everyone went to congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on
Congratulations on the minister's visit.
Congratulations, long live you, congratulations.
Congratulations, the minister’s watch is well-deserved.
You deserve it, Minister's aide.
Brothers, the responsibility is great, may God help us to carry it, God willing.
As they say, a choice that befits its people.
You left after I told you that Abu Saleh’s phone rang.
He was a little far from it.
Don’t mind him
What kind of love suddenly came over him?
And Abu Sultan is not easy.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Well done, you did your best.
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, mom, that you didn’t believe me.
You are telling me coffee shop talk, coffee shop talk.
After her husband died, she said that I was the one who killed him.
May God protect us, may God protect us.
So you don’t have anything to say, you don’t have anything.
Mom, get up, let’s go, you’re driving me crazy, get up.
What do you mean, it’s none of anyone’s business?
Relax, you
I just went in and showed them my ass because they pissed me off.
They are right
But I didn’t want to say that in front of my mother. You know, my mother would expose us.
Whatever you hear, you spread it. They call it a sieve. We don’t want a scandal.
What guarantees you that if they remove him, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked
And if he is removed, you will be the first candidate.
What guarantees you that they will even remove it?
I’m not sure about this one.
I see him carrying you just like I see you in front of me now.
You’re doing magic for him.
But the plan I have in my head is guaranteed and effective.
The plan of burning and stopping
Let him ban all activities that take place in the country.
At that time he will burn, either he will be burned or he will be fined, and if he is fined, he will have to pay the fine.
I swear, brother, I don’t know how, I don’t know what to tell you.
This trip of yours is called participation, and it reflects how much you love the country.
So you see it like that?
You are a statesman today, you must be in the picture.
I have to contribute to everything. I apologize, Your Excellency. I apologize. I apologize.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
What? Long live you, this is just a simple sheep, it’s not worthy of you. What? What did you say, long live you? Are you coming with me today?
The real is waiting for you outside.
You know, to be honest
I don’t want to go.
I’m tired, I’m tired of posing, I’m tired.
The Minister of Justice changed his words today, and as he told you, you are a social figure who has lived a long life.
May God make this good man subservient to you.
Receive, receive, receive
I don’t imagine me
Ati Ati
I took him to a party and a wedding today. If he doesn’t get slapped, he’ll get slapped with okra. Picture.
I also brought you something nice that I want you to give to her.
Listen, I also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
That’s it, make it shine. I want it to shine, shine, shine until it’s polished. I’m looking for this shine.
The shopkeeper, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, Mubarak’s bike, if there is a picture, a picture, the minister’s hour, give him a picture, give him a picture, I don’t, I don’t, go away, give him.
This cycle
Congratulations on the opening, God willing. Congratulations, the minister congratulates you.
Picture, picture, she is fat, fat, may you live forever.
Nothing, may God bless you.
I have it on the second page.
He doesn’t know what it is.
National participation
Remember Allah
This is the fourth friend of mine who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities, Umm Khalid. They call you the active social activist.
I heard a word yesterday that hurt me.
Yesterday was the party that Bu Sultan took me to.
The Buds' swimming victory party
One person was talking to his friend.
They think I can't hear them.
The minister said
I want to buy a birthday gift for my nephew.
Hello hello
I will wait for you inside the newspaper every day, dad.
Yes, yes.
This is what you will do, bring a lot of light, dad, what do you want me to do, fuck you dad.
Whether you pay money or don’t pay money, there is no problem.
This is what it means, your minister will not look for him and will not search for him.
I am I, Abu Saleh, the minister.
Bo Sultan didn’t come to take me to a place, I’m waiting for him.
He made me sit in the first row and went to his car to rest.
I don’t want anything from you, may God guide you.
Come on, my dear, for the sake of my parents, listen to him. I’ll call you back in a bit to make sure.
And you started calling from yourself.
People are giving us discounts.
I told you
It’s really nice.
Aye, this aye will take me back.
I bear witness that this minister is God's servant, God, God, may He protect him.
Hello, hello, the minister is coming.
No, I’m a little tired today, by God.
Okay, if you have this enthusiasm, give the order.
You don’t have to worry, my brother Sa’ad will take you and look for a party for you, God willing, he will find something for you.
It's a good party.
No, we don’t have any activity today.
No, by God, there isn’t.
Where can we find a child?
You're welcome, you're welcome.
I say there is no one to ask.
May God bless you, Ruhollah.
I tell you to lie down and rest.
A moment of happiness
Anything, God willing, we will do.
What beauty!
And it can still be done at a later time.
And this is just a show in the cabin. Just look at the photographer and let him slap him in the face with a few pictures.
Oh, that’s good. Oh, goodbye.
You have killed him
I hope that the reserve league match will be good and that he will be alone on the field.
This is the minister who is destined for us.
Sweet, he reached the top.
The end is near now that people have started talking.
May you live long, he is now more famous than you.
May you live long, if you go somewhere, take Abu Saleh with you.
Long live you
A shining star
We turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister has arrived, the minister has arrived, the minister has arrived.
I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine, I swear to God, if one of you takes a picture of me, I’ll break you, I’m not coming down.
Brock broke my camera, I can't take pictures.
I greeted you a lot.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is my brother, Khulood.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Why is that?
This is the first time I see him.
The first time you see him
I haven’t seen him for years.
Oh my God
This is my immortality.
I haven’t seen you for a long time, come to me, my love, come
What can we do about him? He is used to it.
Oh, there is no power and no strength except with God. You replied to the same topic again.
Get out, I’m telling you to get out and stop giving me a headache. I just got back from the wedding at three in the morning by myself.
But come on, let me rest, this is not a story anymore.
Build your brother
I swear to God I will tell my father what you have done to yourself, you have become like a girl.
He was just playing, playing.
He was playing with a makeup box and I told you he was playing with it.
But this is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Khulood is back, and I wish all the kids were like him.
With all these ads and nonsense that he posts about his brother.
Come on, my darlings, come and say hello.
Hey my loves, how are you?
No, my love, we’re not going to Spain this summer.
I need you
Cheetahs from Kuwait
Hi Hamada
Listen to me, I’m talking to you
There is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.
I’ll let my beloved Amal choose.
But what do you really think?
I say the one by the sea is better.
I hope that in the near future we will buy a yacht and go directly from home to the sea.
We and our children
Come on, set a date for the wedding.
It’s almost over, just one year and a few months left.
What is this? Your brother has put on too much perfume.
I hope you’ll be honest. I’ve noticed your brother Khalid, I don’t know how.
But it’s very different from your brother Saad.
Whether he came back or not, it’s everyone’s own choice, my love, and everyone is free to act as they wish.
Then your fiancé is a retard who doesn’t know that there are unisex perfumes.
I say let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself.
I don't care.
Khaled Masad
It’s not just your perfumes that you use like women.
You even use their colors.
What are you doing, Khalid?
Oh, you really don’t have a story.
Mom, why don’t you want to believe anything about him? Don’t you see his actions and behavior?
This is the time of perfumes for both.
Did you hear me? I warned you.
You saw the Bluetooth
Listen, the guys are talking in the majlis, they say it’s widespread in Doha.
I heard about him, Rauna.
You will see, then I will tell you.
Oh, look at how she dances!
Bal bal bal bal jo movements
These are the girls. This is the one you said dances well and does moves. Do you know who this is? This is Khulood, Muhammad’s cousin.
My cousin Khulood's dog's money
But here, I’ll show you it.
Wait for his brother Saad to come.
Why don’t you let him come and I’ll show you? Let him come, Saad will send him the Bluetooth so that his family can see it.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, hello.
A certain defeat
My cousin is sitting far away, I can see him shining.
I can’t, I can only tell you that your Bluetooth is on.
I’ll just send you something.
Thank you, Sheikha.
Shut up, you bastard, you son of a bitch.
You are finished, Saad.
I'm traveling tomorrow
You won’t see my face in the country again.
Where will I hit you on your head? Where will I hit you on your head?
What will people say?
They say their son has left them and traveled, and you want to make a scandal for us.
Wow!
What Khulood did to your son is a source of pride and honor.
A real old mold, it’s not a scandal for once.
This is what my face looks like when they say this is my brother.
Say he went to get treatment, study, work, commit suicide, anything.
The important thing is that I don’t live in a place where the scandal haunts me every day.
Where are you going to go back to?
Go to hell
This is the end
We don’t know where that one is, and this one is packing his bags to travel.
We don’t even know where he wants to go.
What do you think will happen?
What’s wrong with you now? I came to your house so that you would pity me, but you said things that hurt my heart.
I told you to take care of him.
Don’t leave it for the servants.
You didn't know about it, nor did you care.
Your father is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
My mother is right
So there is no hope for the sake of your sister?
You are right about this.
All he did was make us immortal, he made us all faceless among people.
I can’t see anyone.
You told him something.
This is my father’s biggest mistake.
We are in the case of the fucking faggot Khulood.
I didn’t tell him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
I’m just going to the airport.
I’m very worried about him.
Our house had to get to this point, Amal.
Don't be surprised
Khulood and his ilk were not accused of tarnishing the reputation of their people.
Their brothers and sisters heard it
No matter how much religious values call them
They go and dance and get drunk
In the evil drain
I swear to God, dad, I’m confused.
Goodbye, dad.
Take care of yourself, dad.
Yeah, I actually have a small gift for you, dad.
A gift for me
Now that he has put the CD in the laptop, I am afraid of what will happen. Walk with me.
Oh my God, Mom!
Is it possible, Mom? My dad is still watching the CD. It’s only three minutes long.
Can be seen
Where does he appear and where can he go?
Answer me, what’s wrong with you, Abu Sa’ad?
Dad
It’s okay, Amal.
If I look for it, I will get very tired.
So that I can find and throw away your morals.
But forgive me
May God help you.
I say, I see you've gone up to the roof.
My love
We are in the age of freedom.
The era of human rights has nothing to do with us.
Whoever has an aerial, take a thousand, my darling.
Of course, this talk will make God love America, my darling.
Al-Hinn Arf in Majjiyadah
Malum one thousand and two hundred
May God be sufficient for you, and you are the one who stood with the driver. I asked him how much his salary was.
Mom, I don’t have any money, I have a lot of work to do.
The one who complains to me keeps saying that the salary is a little bit and there is no benefit. We gave him seven hundred with him. He got the license and you increased it by a hundred. What else does he want?
I told him that when you complete the year, I will increase your salary.
He looks greedy and will make our lives miserable.
But stop it, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, deport him and get rid of him.
It’s easy for you, this word is easy for you.
You mean you’re going to make him pity me? I hate riding in the car with him.
Leave him alone, that's it.
You just told me the story. I’m the man of the house. I’ll decide to keep quiet. You too, just shut up. I’ll handle it.
Get up, he wants to go out, get up.
Come stop
What do you think he says?
My friend says that you don’t see what’s inside the village, whether he says it or not.
Dad, this is not a friend, this is my uncle, I am the brother of my father's brother.
It’s five minutes to go, God willing, we’re on our way.
Five minutes
Leave it inside your head, you're good.
You don’t have any air for madam, all you keep saying to her is salary increase, salary increase.
Everything is expensive in this world of ours.
After a few months, he will give eight hundred.
Dad, I have a big problem in the country.
This is a driver inside Doha in Hassal, one hundred thousand two hundred.
In the first one, there could be a thousand, in the second one, three hundred more than a thousand, dad.
I’ll think about it patiently.
Look, I’ll add another hundred and that’s it. Hush, hush, no more additions.
You don't just talk, you do a hundred more things to get the job done.
A peer to say
I say I will you
I gave him a hundred, but it was of no use.
Two hundred, no use.
Shashi, I am afraid.
Not Kov
I don't understand what you're saying.
I hope it will be three or four thousand.
I tried to fix the snow machine inside the house, but it didn't work. There's no point in spending a lot of money on it.
I am very scared.
This is all so adorable
How much
Two thousand five hundred
I am afraid of the police, this is Egy and I am in prison.
No koff ant
I just made your coffee.
I’m telling you, I’m wearing my coat and I’m going out.
I voted on it, but no one answered me.
The only thing left in his room was the closet, which was empty.
Amneera, her servant, is 14 years old.
I have nothing to say but may God be sufficient for him.
Okay, I’ll come to you.
I went to the police and reported it.
Now that you have reported it, you are no longer responsible.
We will not fail, God willing.
And if you look around the neighborhood here and there, you might see him. Please let us know if you do.
I’m after the money, and when I’m full I’ll go and surrender myself.
I bring them, I spend on them, I dress them, I feed them, I train them, I drive their car.
It's not up to him
The game starts now, come on, come on, get in, it’s better.
Yeah, we were afraid to tell you.
These are the foxes' team, and foxes don't get caught easily.
Do you know that if more than three people register, it means we didn’t win? We need ten or fifteen.
Obvious mockery, obvious mockery. Let's be honest, the mockery is obvious.
This level, if it doesn’t get more than three, it’s not an MB team, it’s the foxes team.
I’ll tell you, take it.
I have faith in the soul, the players, and the performance.
He has nothing. They should thank God if they get out with less than three. They should thank God.
Our team is still hungry for appetizers, they say. This is the team of foxes, get away from us, dad, they are.
You scored a goal, you're comfortable, you're happy now.
I expect there are more statements, or is that it and it stops here?
This is a very good fox. This is in your brain, come to me, there is no good in you, you are looking for capital. This fox eats chicken.
No, I don’t have a car.
You are my money's companion.
You didn’t hear what he said.
He told you that this fox is very problematic.
You are in good hands, there is no problem.
Yes, sir.
You don’t know or what?
This is the site of the Fox Team.
He sometimes appears on the Fadfod program.
You will lose today, you will be defeated.
By God, you are a shitty team, you are a loser, you never win, you are always defeated.
What do you think about today's result, Thuloub?
What will this result in?
The result of this class is foxes.
This guy should come and take his own money, he’s the one who made the shot.
Let’s be realistic, don’t tell me that the foxes won and flew away.
This is Papa's foxes.
This is a fox taking a chicken to make food.
Oh, long live you, you didn’t see what he was doing here in the stands.
The audience is dying of laughter.
Zaher is inside Malab and his money is safe.
He is a real fan, meaning he has real loyalty to the club.
This is for the big Qataris who go to malls and all that stuff.
A friend invited me to have a cappuccino.
Look at the world, brother.
The boy took out 500 riyals in front of my eyes and paid the bill.
Let me hear the poem you wrote about our match with the frogs.
The safety of the Arabs present in the tribe.
You are a frog.
You are not part of my team, you are turning against me, you are my enemy.
Everyone cursed the club and the team, see what happens.
There is no word
The day one of the foxes was expelled
What is the reason for this?
I don't know what you mean by "سوي ترد واهد مال ثالب فريق".
I made this game name from these letters, how did I do?
Salama Salama Salama Arab tribe of Hatherin
Every month we meet to choose the ideal fan.
Mashallah, who did you choose to honor this month, God willing?
The members of the association's board of directors are the ones who make the decisions.
May you be cursed, and may each one of you be the size of a camel.
Who runs this big club, Thuloub?
Get up, get up, the driver who ran away from us is on TV, get up.
Now this is it.
This is a good story, that one is a fart.
Pen or it will hurt you, snow says
But now I know how to reach him.
Oh God, let the audience come out.
Follow him
It is a wrap from me.
It is an accelerator
We lost him now, that’s it.
Sweet
Shut up, you don’t make decisions, I’m the man of the house, I’m the one who decides.
We cut doubt with certainty
Majed Abdalrahman Al Sebji
Name, name, name, Allah, Allah sleeps on this wealth, you are blessed by Allah.
Who built Sebej
Buy a record in my name, Nam Lalala, he doesn’t want to live in Andy’s house.
I just want to make an investment.
God’s pocket is good, invest in His generosity. God bless you.
What do you want, people?
There is nothing to do, may God bless you, may God bless you.
Come on, guys, let’s have some coffee.
May God bless you, you have no story, you don’t command anything, may God honor you.
Are you saying you’re sure? Is this okay? You want to embarrass us in front of the cabaret?
May God protect us.
Mom, mom, I'm mom
Now, what will your father do to us? We don’t know.
I didn’t mean it, mom.
Please, mom, don’t tell my dad.
Your father is turning the house upside down on our heads.
He’ll definitely kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn’t break it with the workers.
Zain, mom, why don’t we go get some glue and stick it back together?
We will stick it on it, Mom.
Where can I find one like her? How would I know? Where did your uncle get her from? He brought her as a gift.
I swear I'm afraid for you because of him.
Mom, I’m afraid my dad will hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Come on, go to your room quickly.
Uncle, uncle, uncle, you are my uncle.
Uncle, the vase is broken, uncle.
Mom, Walid is not coming with you.
No, mom, it doesn’t matter what’s happening with you.
He left home, mom, he’s afraid of his father.
It’s a sin, mom. Fear God for the boy’s sake.
Oh, Mom, this is not parenting. May God guide you.
What should I do now, mom?
I don’t know how to act.
I don’t know, but I’m afraid for him because of the cars on the street.
May God protect him, God willing. I think he might have gone to the shop or to the neighbours’ house to play with the kids.
I would sacrifice myself for him, my little Walid is so cute, kind and lovable, oh mother.
Lala, mom, seek refuge from the devil and don’t worry, God willing, everything will be fine.
Oh, mom, goodbye.
Where is his son?
My dad is going to beat me.
My dad is going to kill me because of the beating.
Don’t be afraid, my darling.
Don’t be afraid, my love.
I didn’t let him lay a hand on you.
I broke it against my will.
Come on, dad, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face has turned yellow.
May God fix him, may God fix him. Come here, my son, come here.
Oh God, oh Generous One
I’m afraid my father will come to me here.
But dad, don’t worry.
No one interferes in my son's upbringing.
This is my son and I raise him the way I see fit.
But it’s a shame that the child is trembling in fear of something he didn’t do. Shut up, father.
Why doesn’t he have eyes?
Let him open it.
The bag accidentally hit the vase. Believe me, he didn’t mean it.
You, you have to defend him.
Don’t say anything to him for my sake, forgive him this time, the boy is pitiful because of fear.
But where is he now? What is he doing with you at this hour?
He is not here with us.
Where is it?
Take a shower inside Qom.
I’ll take it to my brother today.
Okay, if he brings another one other than the first one
Come on, let’s take a picture, brother, we want to play.
Your mom said you are studying.
Dad, just this game and we’ll go study.
Why don’t you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, dad.
Okay dad, go away, don’t ruin it for us.
Come on, dad, that’s enough, don’t overdo it. Come on, dad, we’re going to get up and study.
What is this nonsense? Look at this.
If you do, I will call your uncle, Abu Walid, right now.
No, no, don’t tell my uncle, don’t tell my uncle, no.
What do I owe you?
I tell him that you don’t listen.
Come on, let everyone go and get their books and study.
Okay dad, put your phone in your pocket, we’re going to study. Okay dad, don’t tell my uncle.
Oh God, I’m confused and don’t know how to act.
I’m afraid that if he finds out, he’ll cause us a problem.
He will definitely ask me why I took him to the hospital.
Okay, what’s wrong with what you told him?
If he knew that Walid had Ebola in his bed, he would kill him.
Oh, Mom, it’s all his fault.
Oh, Mom, this is a psychological thing.
The boy is not small anymore, he is now twelve years old.
It’s okay, mom.
They’re coming to have dinner at our place. Then I’ll just hint at it, mom.
Vagif Ashirov
Her mother is going to Bahrain to buy abayas.
Mom, a pilgrimage and a need.
Fun and legislation
He says every night that he wets his bed.
I read Eboli every night in bed, don’t tell me the story.
He said I had to take him to the hospital so they could treat him.
The railways don't have a story at all.
He doesn’t understand anything.
He is right
I have to take him to the hospital, Mom, so they can see what’s wrong with him.
His hose is very dry and straight.
Elsba is the last one in the neighborhood to hear the screams.
Sit down.
Eat, my mother, eat.
I have nothing to say.
I want to take a quick shower, wash up, and I’ll go get you some clothes. Come on.
I asked you, please.
I have to teach them a lesson.
Don’t you interfere.
This is what we call success.
And the immortality of forty-nine out of fifty
This is a success.
But their signs are good.
I told them, “Woe to you if you don’t get fifty out of fifty.”
Please don’t take them to your brother.
They need to be disciplined.
These are my children.
Okay, I swear, uncle, uncle, this is the last time.
Why don’t you bring fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Zaide, alone
I tell him not to go with us to public places.
We went to the hospital yesterday, they let him in, but they told him, "You can't come in, it's none of your business."
You’re not going unless you go with us.
But just call me, my brothers.
Okay, uncle, I’m dying. Okay, okay, okay, okay, I’m dying. Uncle, this is the last time. Okay.
Let me teach you a lesson, come on.
Be careful, this is not the beating we will see at the end of the year if one of you doesn’t get fifty.
I said the swimming pool
And fear of oil
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They told us tomorrow
Khaled Abdul Rahman
Well done, Khalid, you did a great job.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent, Faisal.
May God bless you.
Mashallah, you are smart, you came second in the class.
The teacher is shouting because he got 49 out of 50 in accounting.
The teacher is scared of his father because his father wants him to get 50 out of 50.
I’m not talking to you, son.
Call, call the friend who is with him in class.
He said I saw him at the school gate.
Call, call Maj, maybe he’s going to his grandmother’s house.
No, he didn’t go to them.
Where did this guy go? Where did he go?
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
What’s the story with this kid, brother?
Oh, he’s definitely a failure and afraid of his family.
May God guide you, you bastard. The boy is excellent and came in second in the class as well.
But he’s afraid to go to their house.
Because he is only missing two degrees in mathematics.
May God have mercy on him.
Walid Walid
Walid Walid
Come here, Walid.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, minus one degree, two degrees, it’s okay, I’m not saying anything, I’m not doubting you, I’m not hitting you, Walid.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.
Nuclear energy
which constitutes sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
Saudi Arabia leads the world's reserves with a percentage of twenty-four percent.
Then Libya, the United States and Nigeria.
at a rate of three percent for each of them, and the rest of the world combined at a rate of fifteen percent.
And then
and also from production
This is probably one of the secrets and reasons for the scramble for this region and its countries by the major industrial nations.
And at the top of them is the United States of America, the world's largest consumer of oil energy.
However, oil prices are constantly rising.
And coinciding with a decline in the role of the US dollar
which is used as a unit for oil pricing
where the price of a barrel reached yesterday
This has led to an increase in the revenues of producing countries, and at the same time
which would increase inflation in them
Inflation in some of those countries has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
Life and commodity prices
in a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's phone numbers.
Deputy hours Welcome to you
I would like to start with you with the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where could prices go?
Of course, where prices could go is a puzzling question.
Or what is called market force
Not OPEC
and not the producing countries
It is not the producing countries, and OPEC has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is it only the relationship between price and supply and demand?
And not even now, supply and demand do not have a significant impact.
What are the factors?
Other factors besides supply and demand play a role.
What for investors
They felt a lot of pressure and turned to oil, gold, or what is called commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in the stock markets.
and gold too
We have seen gold rise from $350 in recent years to reach $970 now.
It is still today, as I mentioned, about one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all increasing, and if they decrease, it is a slight decrease.
Let me remind you that this was in the first quarter of this year.
This is the second quarter, when prices are supposed to drop due to low demand for oil.
But we found the market to be in an exciting and amazingly changing situation.
In the second quarter, at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
Economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
I talked about political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Do you think that Iran expects Fallon's resignation amid the political complications?
It accompanied her today and made the headlines of most American and international newspapers, which could affect oil prices.
Beh beh el mayya ay ay el youm ay
We are now in the age of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Unreal factors can have an impact.
And they create a kind of turmoil in the market.
And also create a kind of political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out that other options for fuel could also be pursued with regard to Iran.
The markets always react to the news of the badger.
Of course, there is no confirmation yet that the United States is at war with Iran.
I am one of the people who does not see this scenario.
Falun is and may be there, we haven't seen it. What will it be like in the future?
But we are the ones who work in the energy sector.
We see that all these political tensions
Global oil supplies
On the contrary, there is a very comfortable supply.
What does it mean that there is oil going into storage?
There is never any shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps it is a preparation for the next war.
Given this reassuring picture you are talking about regarding supply and that there are no obstacles to supply.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan
That’s another thing.
Prices rise to record highs
The price of oil could reach
World oil reserves
You are here. This is here for today. The Gulf is the most important.
in addition to Iraq, Iran and other Gulf countries
They now represent more than sixty percent of oil reserves, so that's definitely it.
You are today
If a very minor accident occurs
Therefore, it indicates
This means that if a war is waged against Iran, there is no guarantee how high oil prices could rise.
God knows, it might arrive today. We arrived without it.
Wars up to one hundred and seven dollars and one hundred and ten dollars, and it might jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, as I said, oil is under psychological and political stress.
And the tensions of Yemen and the speculators who exploited these tensions
only an oil investor
It is not a real investment, it is called a non-investment. It is future buying or future marketing, yes.
It is called oil paper.
And all of these are speculations in oil paper.
All its production is approximately three hundred thousand barrels, or less.
These people may be encouraged to buy more, which will lead to further increases.
I hope April is an April Fool's joke.
I hope there isn't any
Jenny is coming to the area and it is said that this is on his main agenda.
My generation is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media people have said.
I didn’t know what was in Jelly’s bag.
I cannot predict what it will mean.
Is he going to start a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
And why doesn’t the son do something else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. April is very close, just a few weeks away and we will enter April.
And the world may pay
And America is a major consumer nation.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the difficult number
You can't throw this number.
Its production costs are cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely
No other country in the world can do it, Gulf.
We have heard this talk from the West and from the United States for many years.
High employment
etc. And the Caspian Sea War remembers the story and
Whatever these dreams are
When you sit with the close ones in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
What are they saying?
About supplies, the importance of the region, and the importance of precautions
When I asked one of the European officials, I said, "It is strange that you talk among yourselves in the pilgrimage in closed rooms."
In a way other than the way you speak in front of
Or the media said no, for political reasons.
And of course there is what is called the standard anus, or in other words, two holes.
The word that everyone who knows it understands that it is the role of the Gulf states.
It is important today, for example, in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest oil producer and exporter in the world.
and enter
Despite all this
Commander of the Central District
Start a war with Iran
even if it is an air war or an air strike, as they say
Supplies
You are not late, you are very generous.
I don’t agree with you, we are not in
We do not deal with Westerners either.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
regardless of the nationality of this market
It means non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (parentheses) for the sake of generosity.
Arab generosity
Here, give it to me.
Observers say that the real price of oil is
The reason for the rise in oil prices
You Gulf people, OPEC and the countries
You are very generous to the Americans, you insist on holding on to their currency.
You said that the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I was told that the real price in exchange for the dollar's decline is sixty to seventy.
Okay, the price is now one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar fell by thirty-five percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take proportion and ratio
No one can deny that.
One of the main reasons is
Compared to the decline of the dollar
If we take, if we take
If we take this comparison
Oil prices
because the United States of America
Of course, it is in her interest at the moment for the dollar to fall.
The weakness or stagnation of the US economy is something that the United States cannot recover from.
So, so, what happened in this weakness and economic recession?
You too have become
The United States lowers interest rates on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the dollar?
Let’s talk about why the price of oil is linked to the dollar.
The first one is over a hundred years old
The first barrel of oil was exported when exports first began, and it was exported from the United States of America.
Issued in US dollars
It has been so since the beginning of the 20th century until today.
Dollar pricing Pricing oil in dollars
historically became
And for a hundred years, the whole world has been interacting and getting excited.
which makes Norway the third largest oil producing country today.
and its source of oil
Russia is the second largest oil exporting country.
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe
Priced in dollars, not priced at
Everything is changing in the world. There are other sources and information that point to something other than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
Oil has become the real cover.
Is this statement true? There is nothing else.
These agreements
It is based on the idea that oil will remain the cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States protecting these regimes.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Let’s take OPEC as an example today.
You have sixty-six percent of the deputy's seekers.
Of the thirteen countries
Of the eighty-five barrels per barrel, forty percent is OPEC's share.
There are many countries that are very large in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the barriers that prevent pricing in another currency?
See, because the price is in another currency
Not all adults make decisions when they read.
You are Saudi Arabia and the great Gulf countries.
Today is the day of OPEC as a whole.
There are sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that
There is an agreement between all oil-exporting countries to
There is no direction or intention to change.
And try
But now these countries are not able to change the pricing currency.
unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of Tared?
Let me speak now, I mean, about the Europeans.
Why don’t they export their oil?
from the North Sea, Russia or Norway, in euros or rubles
Because it is in their interest for their currency to be expensive, high and elevated.
On the contrary, no, on the contrary.
Here is where they have the loss.
One euro buys one and a half barrels.
You are the losers because your currency has fallen because it is tied to the dollar.
He is also a loser, a very big loser.
The connection between currencies here and the Gulf is a historical one.
You remember that in the 70s the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
Now you are connected when you talk about separation.
It’s like marriage when you get married.
And you bring divorce, divorce is not easy.
No here
Or are you doing a Catholic decoration with the dollar?
The costs must be studied in a way
To study in a professional way and to teach
Kuwait also devalued its currency by 25% against the dollar.
Saudi Arabia Bahrain UAE Qatar
It may adjust the price of its currency.
We’re talking about it now, but that doesn’t mean you don’t intend to study or think about the subject.
Of course, the study differs, as His Excellency the Prime Minister stated.
Wall said that the Qatari currency is undervalued by 32 percent.
Be part of this study
I don’t think there is a trend that you alone are unique in having.
Kuwait has taken a unique step. Why don’t you take the same step?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than it is a loss.
But we are
And nothing else.
These four Gulf states have announced
Everyone means a believer.
I am one of the people who personally support him.
It will support it
You must be part of this study.
In and of itself
He created what He created of one nation or two nations.
until the time of the currency comes
You won't be able to change the Watani situation.
Of course, there are specialists there who will study it.
They will be the owners
This requires a political decision, not specialists.
Let’s wait and not rush now, see what happens today.
People started, I mean
Of course, in a complicit situation
The deputy said that the inflation rate in Qatar reached 14% in 2007 and will increase to 15% in the coming year.
It eats people's salaries and devours people's salaries here, the salaries of the employees here.
People living in Qatar have seen their salaries eroded by thirty-five to forty percent.
We will be back after a short break to find out the extent of the salary increases that will take place.
Employees in Qatar will be at least as good in the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to “Without Borders” in this episode, in which we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
Qatar's Minister of Industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the huge price increase
Oil, which has brought tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
It was about oil and my question was about the expected increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has a reserve of 97.8 billion and it is expected to reach 2.6 billion.
Only one ton, and the Kuwait Times report is an economic report on the largest revenues of the Gulf countries.
Saudi Arabia's expected revenues in 2008 are 190 billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy last year, sixty-six in the UAE this year, it was expected to be fifty-seven.
Kuwait was sixty-four and it was fifty-four.
A twenty-first share of oil minus fifty-five billion
It is gas, other reports say. God forbid envy, we don't envy you, Mr. Deputy.
Iraq, forty-seven billion
One and a half trillion
Areas of expenditure were one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries imported one thousand billion, i.e. one trillion.
Imports were multiple dollars.
A $300 billion investment in the United States
Nine out of ten billion
There were three percent in Bahrain.
In 2007, there were six and a half in Oman, which will increase to seven. In Qatar, there were twelve seventy-five, which will rise to five hundred and fifty in Qatar.
This means that those living in Qatar can expect more expensive goods, higher prices and a more expensive life.
Life is being devoured, prices have risen sharply and will rise even more in Qatar.
We feel sympathy for everyone.
It must be treated
And the treatment means aiming to control inflation.
So you will increase salaries by fifty percent?
They say you are against salary increases.
This is not true and in a way
Ministers against salary increase
There is a problem and the solution must be the best solution.
There is no patchwork solution.
Okay, is there a balance between the two?
This is it.
The important thing is to address inflation.
And here in Qatar in the committee
His Highness the beloved Emir issued a decree to form it.
And put
Put and set means rules
Strong in solving the problem and controlling inflation
The important thing is to control inflation first.
Inflation
Here it is, if you don't control it.
Be the deputy's messenger now
A market research specialist published it at the end of February, a few days ago.
Prevent these people from entering.
Now you will deal with inflation and let inflation eat away at these people's incomes.
Many of them are now
Entry into other countries
Increase our salaries, then I want to see how inflation gets stuck and then goes down again.
I'm saying what they say, which is that there is parallelism in the subject.
But now
It is not a temporary solution.
The problem is increasing in a greater way.
And so here
An attempt to limit inflation from one limit to another
Boredom will always
Because the increase was huge over the past year, over the previous year. Right.
The oral point The oral point
And those who work with the government are different from those who work in the private sector.
The private sector is completely neglected.
The issue of this increase must also be considered fairly.
I don’t know where you got these notes from or how you got them.
We live in Qatar, where the deputy lives, not in Germany.
I tell you the opposite, today the private sector has started to pay.
Most of
Many Qataris who used to work in the public sector have moved to the private sector.
Because of the high salaries
He has a problem
It moves to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic.
He gives good salaries.
We are connected to what is called the market force.
market power
They do not come, and they are highly specialized.
Don’t come to Qatar because Qatar is the least, the least means the least salaries or the least costs.
or they come at a cost
Okay, with our full understanding.
I am not anticipating events, nor am I saying that there will be a salary increase.
So there is no hope either?
To control this inflation
Let’s take some time
control this inflation
And God willing, this is what the report says, that Qatar is in 2008.
Inshallah, that is to say
We believe that these numbers will change.
Spray a little on people
It is a process, which means that we should be a professional company.
Of course, with professionalism and with everything else, but
Inflation
Because of spending
The big one on different projects
Let me ask some questions from the viewers, and I hope that everyone will ask them directly. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
This is based on the fact that the ruling families are in the Gulf.
I don’t think the reason for that is that OPEC doesn’t agree.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the ruling family, and the rest is spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain the same.
Peace and the mercy of God
May God bless you, my brother Ahmed.
I will not talk too much about what my brother said regarding the ruling regimes and the issue of pegging the dollar to the riyal, or the riyal, or the Gulf currencies to the dollar, but...
Through it, America wants to globalize the world under its banner.
The US trade deficit with China has reached eighty-two billion dollars.
With him, the European Union reached sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all global policy trends are against the dollar.
We are now paying the price for this as Arab countries and oil-producing Gulf states.
It could end up in a confrontation with the US.
And among the first developed countries in the world, such as China, Russia, and others, the issue may become
Purely military
The explosion of Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and even American bombs.
Thank you very much for this explanation and this information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Welcome, your question
Could you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Ask your question
But what I see is that the deputy's assistant is determined not to cooperate.
The topic of not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is falling.
And, God willing, it will fall to the bottom.
He is a good man.
The style of Arab brothers should not be followed.
Thank you, brother Mohamed, thank you, thank you, and now we have the last question from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. What is your question, Ahmed?
May God bless you with goodness in the evening.
Thank you very much for the great interview.
A salary increase, God willing, things will improve. We don’t mean him, what is meant is what?
We are all facing problems, it’s true, but it’s not because of the salaries, no.
Salaries, God willing, things will be fine.
But first, ask your question quickly.
I can’t hear you. There’s a problem with your line. Do you have a question?
All of them are expensive, all the prices are high, all the goods are imported.
Out of European countries
Okay, we have factories and workshops all over the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you for taking your time.
The issue of high prices is now an important issue.
The case of the poor with the poor people, man, stay with the poor people, the deputy is looking for them.
The one who doesn’t have a billion here is basically a poor person.
Here it means that we are brothers to each other, of course.
Those who don't know Qatar
This is not true for the State of Qatar.
Whoever comes to Qatar today will see what the indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
The highest growth indicators in the world
This is the tree. Where is it going? What will you do with it?
What is in the context of responding to it?
It’s because when he spoke, the brother from Morocco spoke in a way that was not true and not real.
The person who does not see the defect with his own eyes
If the person who means him comes and sees Qatar, he will see the huge developments that are taking place there.
You are indeed asking for significant growth.
And everyone has the right
And you, the residents, where will you bring people from?
So, does that mean you will, for example, import a surplus from China, for example?
We will not import, God willing.
The state is built on a plan and on
B. The optimal independence of these funds that come from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
To be the State of Qatar
It is considered one of the greatest historical achievements in the Arab world.
Today also the to
LTL focus on
And what will be its impact?
The big post-oil and gas picture
It means you don’t give birth to Dubai.
Every country, every country, every country has its own Every country has its own characteristics
We in the State of Qatar have focused on education.
All the components of the al-al-al-al
There will be a medical city here where people can come and stay.
It will be a media city that will embrace
Of course, it is the world today. Today we must build.
We are building a vision
On the post-oil and gas era
There were fatal mistakes.
Unfortunately, there was a very unfortunate situation where we did not take advantage of this boom because it came as a surprise to us.
But we were not prepared for it, neither in human, technical nor educational terms.
Today I changed after thirty years.
And the most important thing
The day is here, it's a frenzy here, imagine.
Vision
Vision
Many thanks to the deputy. I also thank you, dear viewers.
We hope that you have enjoyed following us and that we have provided you with good service.
Qatar’s foreign policy appears unclear to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations
At a time when Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it still is.
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas
Submitted by Qatar
It has started
Largest Arab country
which angered the regime in Egypt
He came from Qatar in a fit of anger, to the extent that he accused it of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was also not far from important files.
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier who is a prisoner.
Qatar's foreign policy has extended to Qal'atcholiet in a way that has angered larger Arab countries.
And what power puts you in this position?
These achievements include
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us on our website, www.aljazeera.net z.
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
On September 22, 2007, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It was a landmark visit in relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Redrawing borders
Wash off what sticks
This is what I said.
Newspaper or magazine Al-Haqaz
the agreement you made with Saudi Arabia, through which you restored relations and the Saudi ambassador returned.
to Doha
At first, your introduction was long and seemed to require many answers without your last question.
I think he carried it
Especially when it comes to Saudi Arabia.
What is flour
For Qatar, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
existing between the two countries
I spoke about silencing Al Jazeera.
I spoke about a coup movement.
I think these issues have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the clarification.
in the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined to a certain scope.
Points of view
Thank God, this is the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
The Gulf is very important.
More than a hundred years
The relations were always bright, honourable and based on trust.
I want to limit it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This issue is settled and there were no conditions.
To solve any problem
But there was an understanding and there was a sincere intention on both sides.
To resolve this pending issue
It is not a seasonal job, but a strategic relationship.
We wish it not to last, but to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic speech
until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, otherwise I would have avoided a lot of problems.
I always said what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia, therefore, is not diplomacy, it is faith.
The subject of the island falls under the subject of media.
between the two parties, and many countries were brought into the line.
She believes that she can ignite it or that she can gain points at the expense of other countries.
or at Qatar's expense
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
They resolved the dispute that existed within the Gulf family.
This is in contrast to what it was before.
He bowed down out of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement except an agreement of love and an agreement of interest.
But anything that contradicts this topic, ask Al Jazeera management: Have you built a promotion strategy?
There is a grudge between you and Saudi Arabia, so that what happened before can be avoided.
The relationship was originally based on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, four.
There must be solidarity.
I resolved some of the disputes on this basis.
We are working to resolve differences between some Arab countries and other disputes.
Because now, if we look at the differences in the Arab world, they are differences of opinion.
When we have an opinion on a particular policy, a particular procedure, or a particular issue, and another country has a different opinion
This is two points of view.
Some observers thought that you enjoyed criticising Saudi Arabia.
criticizing it
Did you get tired and decide to go in another direction and then go to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
It means the same, the same idea.
Lala, first of all, we don’t enjoy it and we’re not free.
We will not deal with any other party in this manner.
So, the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
Among them, and I know there is an understanding.
It’s too big and you know we founded it.
There is a kind of model
But Saudi Arabia, but but Saudi Arabia
Let me put this in two lines for you.
My dispute with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram began in the issue of April 12th last.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In an extensive investigation, she said that the extensive investigations
Hezbollah network reveals sabotage plot
A plot targeting Egypt, involving three countries: Iran, Syria and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media mouthpiece known for its conspiratorial role
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect
And a struggle over the years
I’m not saying this to stir up anyone’s emotions.
Let me complete what you have completed.
We can
and the Egyptian president
Careful
On Arab relations
First point
Gaza topic
As they say, and as we admit.
Qatar is a country.
It is small in size
You can participate in a scheme of this type.
Because we have suffered from the interference of countries at one time or another, and I don’t want to go back to that.
Who sold some countries’ interference in Qatari affairs?
Therefore, His Highness’s Government’s policy is
Now that they have discovered what they call a conspiracy,
And also, the name was brought up, meaning I want to say that Syria and Iran have a protector and they defend themselves. I am not going to defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter of this kind?
And the pyramids do not speak out of passion.
Qatar said it tried to undermine Egypt's role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
I have expanded it to include a parallel conference to the Arab summit, which will steal the spotlight even more.
And you are using a media horn, which is Al-Qazeera channel.
Here you go.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable with Miss, you know.
I can tell you that we are confident.
We are
It is not our principle to intervene in such circumstances.
What forced our brothers in Egypt is what we hold the Egyptian officials responsible for.
The disagreement or sensitivity that exists among some members of the Egyptian government.
But some officials are sensitive.
What's up?
I’ll come to you on the subject.
The days of Foa, peace, and the issue of peace, and that we
and was preceded by one held in Egypt
And then we had a meeting
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You have no dispute with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, since then
Any Islamic conference is an Arab conference. They are sensitive there.
Why this sensitivity?
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
And we always hope for the best.
We discovered this allergy.
He is three years old.
The Gaza conference that happened
Egypt does not want to hold it in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar and at the summit in Kuwait, we told them, "Hey, guys."
The Palestinian people have been on strike.
More than two weeks
But we are holding it before a scheduled conference, the Kuwait conference, which we were the first to boycott.
People are being killed and
And B Web means procrastination
The dispute began
Nor has any small state stopped this fighting.
Of course I know that some of the brothers are in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else but Egypt.
When they said that after
Okay, you are on the island.
The Israelis reported yesterday that there will be a meeting to stop the fighting before anyone gives a speech or anything.
What is
My brother, they brought in medicine and food during the strike that our brothers were subjected to.
They say the gate is narrow.
What brought the trucks in?
They once told us that there was an agreement on the other side and they had to come.
Now is not the time for us to bring in Fatah or Hamas.
I don’t care about Fatah or Hamas, I care about the one and a half million people who are being attacked.
They don’t have any medicine.
When we started talking about this issue and talking at the Gaza conference
Qatar’s involvement in the matter causes sensitivity in the Egyptian regime.
It’s not interference.
We did not talk about how Egypt is dealing with the situation because this is Egypt's responsibility.
That means one official said we discovered a big conspiracy behind the issue.
He still hasn't told us what the conspiracy is.
That we mean this official.
He tells us that Egypt is a big thing.
Okay, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a major country.
That is why we always ask the great state for many things.
Because Egypt is everything to us
And you also invited them to a conference, which was also a provocation to them.
We were invited to a conference.
Rebuilding Gaza
We coordinated and our position was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden means I know that Turkey has brought things in through Israel.
I would be happy if I saw her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
One of us and among us
And if Egypt wins or does something politically good
This is what we believe is in the interest of Qatar and the Arab world.
Egypt’s stability is important to us.
If she does a good job, that’s important to us.
Let me finish what I was saying to you. Your question and introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The case that you just ruined me with
No, I will tell you, I will tell you, I am now, I mean, angry.
You must be angry at the officials of the Egyptian regime.
We are the ones who made the Doha summit a failure.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom and wanted
He wants to do his business.
And that is why some countries that intervene are prohibited by the UN.
This is what I said to our brother in Saudi Arabia because we
We have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, even on this point.
The severity is due to an apparent internal problem.
He has a certain limit of officials
b. Senior officials
A large country has one person in charge, while a small country has many people doing these things.
So it was you who was there.
It's CNN. It doesn't play any role.
Darfur is part of Egypt's national security and Sudan's.
The five major powers have decided
If it were any country other than Qatar, it would have been possible.
But these sensitivities lead to an increase in the problem. Why do you stick your nose in everything that is near you?
We want to solve the allergy problem. We take allergy medication. They tell us what the allergy is.
Why allergy?
Some of the brothers are in the government.
They have an internal failure and want it.
They want to draw attention to a conspiracy, a coup in Gaza.
It means what the English say about the Italians.
Everything is going well
A recipient not only for instructions but also for analyses.
We know what happened, okay, because
The case must be dealt with locally.
Not treated
No, my priority is my country, by God.
My priority is to do the first thing by looking at the issues that concern my country.
Then I will see if I have enough time.
Consider issues that concern my Arab nation
Otherwise, Qatar tried to fix it.
Think about every Arab issue in which you can contribute and do your best to contribute.
Why is it provocative? Why don’t you take it in good faith?
I can’t treat you.
I can explain my opinion.
You throw it at me.
And we, we, we, in our opinion
What comes from the heart
Let me finish for you.
When the reconciliation initiative was announced and the presidents met in Kuwait, we were optimistic, and I issued a statement welcoming this matter.
In dictations
Of course, the Egyptian official who explained his heroism
In an article, in an interview, or something on TV, I am not going to respond to it.
Because I have a response to every point.
But I am keen to maintain the minimum level of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests.
And also in response to the call made by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But all I advise is him and others.
They are trying to fix their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or anything else, just as we have mistakes in politics and economics, no one is immune to error.
Because they also accuse Qatar of these accusations.
You deny that Qatar has any connection to anything related to Hezbollah cell.
This is a funny topic.
to distort Egypt’s relations and to undermine its role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
We are, first of all, few in number.
If we are able to play this role
This is not true.
There are accusations against you personally.
to pay money to Shalit's captors so that Qatar could take Shalit and take him, and outbid Egypt's role in the matter.
He always accuses us of paying money. First, we didn’t pay money and we didn’t talk to anyone about paying money.
But this is the case
We want Egypt to succeed, just as we supported Egypt and still support it in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
He said that the Palestinian president should remain in office until he resolves this issue.
We were there and were the first to support the State of Qatar.
The Palestinian Authority and institutions will remain until the dispute is resolved.
And We said, “Take.”
The Arab League says no, we passed it because we believe that there are people who do not want this issue.
But we passed it cleverly.
Does that mean he is addressing his boss?
his Prime Minister
Brother, I don’t know if there is a problem.
It’s from us, it’s from them, I don’t know.
They decided now, in the April 12th issue. Al-Shorouk newspaper was the only one to publish the news.
Egypt’s political leadership has decided to launch a news channel to counter the media mouthpiece known as Al Jazeera and put an end to it.
In a few days, everything will be over and it will be settled.
But do you fear that Al Jazeera will become a thing of the past?
It means that we are now living in a political adolescence.
You also surrendered to Saudi Arabia and the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not give up, and they did not give up to us.
We treated them like brothers.
A small state that surrendered to the great state of Egypt.
No, Saudi Arabia is at an important point that we need to clarify.
Qatar’s relations with Saudi Arabia are different.
And then we’ll talk.
Qatari relations with Egypt are strained.
We rely on it a lot.
Let me be honest with you, oh desert
But there is a major political disagreement.
Because we don’t have a personal dispute, I told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you now to solve the two problems of Gaza and what else?
And this is an issue that has affected us a lot.
We want to address this from a psychological perspective, meaning we want to solve this problem.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Prince Saud Al-Faisal's absence
We talked about everything.
But it was clear that things had become tense and were not resolved.
No, no, there was no, look
It means I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt are good.
They have complaints, and we owe them that as brothers.
And we have a complaint that they have a right to make against us as younger brothers.
In a great country, we do not want to compare ourselves to any other great country.
This means that Egypt is bigger than appeasement.
It is not a matter of life and death that I mean, but rather a solution that comes from heaven.
As far as we are concerned, if someone is waiting for a response
Someone is waiting for a method
Qatar has
Treat him differently than you would a peer or a brother.
As a great nation, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if someone deceives someone
This means that I know that Israel is doing this to us.
And although the previous American policy was also with me or against me
I don’t think they want to imitate either Israel or America in this matter.
And then, if we also take their policies into account, they are also under pressure from external parties.
Let me finish telling you about several issues.
We also understand and know that there are still dictations coming even to the great state.
The dress is what drives you in your politics.
We don’t have any movement, our movement is one thing.
This is Qatar’s internal security and it is our internal affair.
And in any area where we can help in the Arab world, we will help.
What are the sources of power for Al Jazeera Channel and Al Udeid Air Base?
You could say that this is not strong.
Faith in God and confidence in ourselves
His Highness the Emir's vision
We don’t want to bother anyone.
Let me finish what I was saying, don’t interrupt me, we don’t want to upset anyone.
We don’t want to compete with anyone.
Let them say whatever they want, whether it is about Great Qatar or anything else.
But we have a point of view.
First, we expelled them and closed the Israeli office.
Glory be to God, they used to say close the office, we closed the office, they got upset and went to tell the Americans, look at these people.
They went and joined what they call the devil's team.
What are they saying?
For Americans and Europeans, these are our friends and we know how to deal with them.
Conspiracies
efforts made
It’s a shame that we’ve reached this stage, and in the end, what?
Oli now
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt? One, two points.
and on the basis that Egypt has a major role in the Arab world
We believe it is important to read it.
I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew
needs to leave
Occupying the attention of the Egyptian public, government, or other entities, or their leaders, with trivialities.
Focusing on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a great nation.
in the foreseeable future
I mean, I really can’t imagine how this issue will turn out, God willing.
And I know there will come a time for reason.
And there comes a time for those who are from us
If I am
or they have
They are united by great Arab interests.
We will find one day that this is the case.
It means that the world still has a long way to go.
I mean, we don’t get angry in the Egyptian way that you have.
If someone extends a hand to us, we will extend our arms a meter.
His Excellency Sheikh
It means that we have never gotten used to running.
But only on a solid basis, we are ready to run to Egypt.
Stand with Egypt
There are now many rumours that Egyptian workers in Qatar have been harmed by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians who work in jobs, whether in universities or major jobs.
Do you know anything about this topic? First of all, it is not Qatar’s nature to cancel jobs and cancel them.
Because these people have nothing to do with what is happening.
This is a market where there is a change in demand, they cancel one and another comes.
It is supply and demand, and in some nationalities it decreased, while in others it increased.
Okay, answer quickly.
The office was there
We were worried about the office, so we should leave it now.
They said that in the days when they were waging a campaign that all our losses in negotiations with Israel were due to this office.
We closed it, let them solve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And we were among them, and it is our custom to invite all accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to honor Gabriela Schell.
No, by God, we did not honor her before, when the relations were, as they say, good. Honoring her now is a bit difficult.
There is no reason now for you to reopen the office at this time.
The office opens if the reasons are absent.
You are the one who made it big.
The size of Egypt, you mean.
It was Egypt that imposed this.
Our relationship with America is a strategic one. Let me be clear with you.
In some matters, and this is one of them.
What are the most important things?
There are issues in our region, in dealing with some of them, we had differences with the previous administration.
We now have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe that there is great hope for this administration.
Jadaa Fi: Moving the peace process forward Jadaa Fi: Solving the Palestinian issue
All our friends, and this is what we deny.
What is happening in Iran and how does it affect the Gulf and you?
This is a matter for the Iranians to decide how to resolve their issues.
among themselves
In their usual way, and I am sure that most of them will overcome this crisis.
Iran’s stability, as His Highness the Emir said.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share a common border with Iran.
Of course, we will have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because we are a country that seeks peace and stability for this region.
We would intervene whenever one party wanted to change or amend the Doha Agreement.
I think Saad Hariri said
It’s over now, only the strategic conversation between the president remains.
Among the Lebanese groups
How to see
As for Yemen, do you have a role to play, or have the Yemenis taken a stand against you?
Look, first of all, we are known to have supported unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab and Gulf state that stood with Yemeni unity.
The topic of the south, we spoke with Yemen and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet with the President of Yemen.
I explained to him that our goal is stability in Yemen, because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I do not want to say what each party did.
But what really hurt me was
Qatar, which took this position, is accused of paying money to the Houthis and to senior officials.
Yemenis, because we do not interfere in these matters.
And whoever stood with unity does not stand against it.
And for another purpose that serves Yemen's interests, whether political, economic or otherwise.
This is a topic that we have no problem with, but I was actually shocked.
Because I went there more than ten times during the fighting. His Highness the Emir sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this accusation is strange.
Time is up, but I would like to ask you very briefly: will these problems that you have told us about, in your attempt to solve problems, change your policy of interfering in other Arab problems?
I swear that if His Highness listens to me, I really think there is no need.
And once he offered us a large sum of money.
More than five billion dollars at that time, which means that if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion, which is better than a headache.
I just say it and I believe it because maybe now is the time in the Arab world.
What is allowed in it under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency Sheikh.
And perhaps even exceptional with the state of Sheikh Hamad.
What was agreed upon in Doha
How did the Doha miracle happen?
Authorize the committee and give it all the support.
On Lebanon, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
Since there was an Arab consensus
We went to New York and were able to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we saw this in Doha, where both parties were keen.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or not to be there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
We see the reality and know what the problem is after sitting with the Lebanese for long hours.
I think it is a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I think that Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere in the region is directly reflected on it.
Whether it is peaceful or not peaceful
Lebanon is destined to be in this location.
to be so
And unfortunately
External reverberations
I can say that the problem is between the Lebanese, even if there is a problem, it is not the number one problem.
Sheikh, I know that perhaps it is too early to talk about what happened behind the scenes, but
What happened? What do you mean you came here?
You stopped, so to speak, the conflict on the ground.
You didn't delay for a single moment
What exactly was going on? I know very well that even the Lebanese leaders at the time, the symbols, were talking to me about what happened.
No, I was there from the beginning.
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him, if we come to Lebanon.
I am presenting this idea, and His Highness the Prince has supported and endorsed it.
All the Lebanese leaders will be present there.
Because you are here in Beirut, I look at everyone in their area.
And you are in the same hotel and in the same place.
And you met and talked on the same plane.
We created this atmosphere, but that was our idea from the beginning.
This was the most important decision, the most important one.
Of course, in Cannes.
And this is what I have noticed from the Arab University.
We will be honest brokers.
And, thank God, I think this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
Both parties
To reach a solution that is honourable to both parties
And the solution is that there is no loser
Before you take your step
The consultation took place at the Arab University and we found support.
What we did
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will move them to Doha.
And he had commanded me
Ignore them, take the load off, and take their phones away.
We were able to bring them there, and also the brothers in Syria supported the position.
And I told you at the beginning that without Arab support, the committee would not have been able to do anything.
They wanted Why did they want the solution?
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened
and this tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
In several cases surrounding the Arab world
And whenever we put out a fire
It is in the interest of the Arab world to be protected from foreign interventions and
And we try as much as possible to make it
sends troops
even if it is military
In this case, I think it is a matter of
At the point of Sheikh's state
He always said to solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file.
A Saudi-Syrian agreement
B Qaf Qaf, if it is correct, or Qaf Arab means Qatar and the Arab League.
Can what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to review ourselves.
Because of Arab differences
And any agreement between two Arab states
And we've tried that.
In the war of seventy-three
When Arabs agree to solve a problem
I think this is a good thing.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
the two parties
They will prevail with wisdom
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we in the Arab world face huge and great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
We are powerless and weak.
How do we stop playing in the Arab countries' arena?
As Arabs, we have at least a minimum level of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
We are spectators
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust between us. Trust is lost between Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries
It’s not so much about treason as it is about a kind of
What is the name of the session? What do they call the session?
This is an issue that requires a stand from everyone, I mean, I think.
So, will you make this wish come true? Will you actually call for an Arab summit?
We feel pain when he feels pain and we feel joy when he feels joy.
I mean, it came up in the conversation.
Can you play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if it is unofficial?
This means that they are keen to find solutions, and I am sure that they will do so with their wisdom.
They may reach an understanding.
They are divided on many issues.
He was in harmony with politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this is the case.
Relations are improving.
Both parties need to want to take a step forward.
But I cannot say for sure that this is what is happening now.
I am sure that if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned
A state of optimism and a state of pride among citizens that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I cannot link what happened in Lebanon
It can be translated as "on the ground", meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There is an escalation, perhaps American-Iranian, perhaps other issues, I mean.
Do you still fear it in the coming months?
We as Arabs
We can only order food and medicine to be delivered.
Electricity for the people
We in Qatar are always ready, Your Highness.
More than one hundred and a half million Palestinians are under siege.
We don’t want them to have weapons, we don’t want them to have victory, and we don’t want
They do all this.
And electricity
And God willing, we will give it to the Red Cross so that they can deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we only deliver food and medicine to them.
And our dispute with them continues.
I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put national interest first.
and leave the illusions
This Palestinian rift now means a big wound.
The solution
And they did not comply and did not commit.
This is a serious issue and they must abide by the Mecca agreement.
They should ask that even if they go to Mecca or Saudi Arabia again.
And they resolve this conflict
They will not benefit.
What promises, about which party?
I hope there is a solution, but
Our position on this issue is known and has been communicated to all concerned parties.
We will not be a party and we will not accept to be a party to any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But the most important thing is that we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone will look after their own interests, but these interests will not harm them or us.
We believe that the Gulf is destined to have a clear agreement between the GCC countries.
and Iran to cooperate and live together in peace.
But when the sheikh says that Qatar is not a party
Is there any detail or explanation?
Just a hint
No, never.
Okay, I would like to return to the Lebanese file, if you don’t mind.
To be honest, the Sheikh's country was facing a major deadlock, but in the last few hours we have reached a solution.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
It may be scattered information that is unrelated to each other, but what happened?
until you reached this conclusion
What happened in Istanbul, I know that it had specific dates set in advance.
Oh, if you knew about the negotiations
continuously on the subject of the solution
There is no doubt that the Kingdom’s support is very important.
And change the tactics of the negotiations
The talks were about
to a positive result by bringing together several parties from several sides
And we started talking.
This is an Arab and Qatari orientation in this paper.
Tell me what is wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the substance, one after the other.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that remained in the end
But the prince passed by the parties.
And he removed this obstacle.
He was free
We heard the speech of the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
Don’t you think that your role is now over?
The most important thing is to keep this issue away from the spotlight.
We have no regional ambitions.
We don't have control over a country or anything, because we are a country, by God.
We are proud of our size. We believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our other brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
N.N. in countries
We want her to do something, and that is very important.
Some small countries are empowered to play this role and are supported in doing so.
It means that some things are excellent, some things are good, and some things are less than good.
The last question is from Sheikh's country.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
A wish to reconcile differences
What is the first confrontation with Israel?
We will stop playing in the Arab arena.
We are fixing our problems in the Arab countries.
Aynqun is an active member in Iraq.
to give him a sense of the situation
Regional and international
But if we put our heads together
It means that we have no victory ahead of us, or that we have no hope at all.
Thank you, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this wonderful interview.
and international efforts to put an end to the ongoing war on Gaza.
And we start with your request to convene a meeting of the Arab League Council at the level of
Ministerial, as if you had given up.
Request for an emergency Arab summit to be held
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be on this program.
Even if the circumstances
The humanitarian situation to which our brothers in Gaza are exposed
Conditions that require us to do a lot more
Qatar has not abandoned the idea of an Arab summit
In fact, when we came up with the idea of the Arab summit before
unified not only by a Security Council resolution but also by
It is not always trampled on and despised.
Let me put it another way.
And we discipline
The street can no longer bear it, even if we as officials bear it, the Arab street.
does not bear
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some of them spoke at the meeting, and we could have held the meeting.
We will make it as complicated as there is Arab consensus.
And I don’t blame those who think that there won’t be a meeting, they might have a point.
He solved the problem, how?
Because it dissolves.
This is an important topic.
Because our goal is not advertising or publicity, our goal is to find
So you didn’t give up on the summit?
And we ask ourselves among them
We will go to put pressure on the poor other side.
The past, the present, and the Security Council resolution, but let us stay focused on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
He clearly said that the situation might require an Arab summit to be held with whoever attends.
We found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit.
who banned
And I don’t know what they mean by moderation.
So we are the only nation
Only the Arab nation, I mean, if we go to any nation in Asia, in Latin America, in so on.
And without a solution
classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our view?
Do we give up on the Palestinian cause?
Because we don’t like them
Do we interfere in Palestinian affairs in a way?
It means that no mother would allow someone to decide who is good and who is bad.
Hamas is Hezbollah, and I don't know what other party will emerge tomorrow.
Is she a student?
And can we make them be a part of the Arab body?
It means that we were supposed to enter into an internal Arab conflict.
Okay, let’s go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel completes its mission
Okay, the second Arab ministerial meeting that you called for
dominated by discussions, disagreements and severe clashes
He is at an important point.
It doesn’t matter, that’s not the point.
If we were to have a meeting
From the crossings
There is no longer a peace issue
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there is a party that tells you no, we have to wait.
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative.
Peace talks with Israel are frozen
We say that we are on a side that says we will lose on this issue.
A loss greater than the one we are suffering now. Well, we have always been respectful, polite and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
Sheikha Saada says that the clashes are not important.
Some people wish they could shed light on Hamas and so on.
This means that it is an expression of a political position rather than a dispute between a minister and another minister, etc.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that happened.
But not everyone
We don't want to speak on behalf of others.
It is very important that we be men of our own, men of our country.
We are conducting the policy of our countries.
Who does things like that on her behalf?
I think it means
I don’t think they will respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone who plays roles on behalf of the West?
No, God forbid, I don’t want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council decision
What will his agenda be?
The position seemed to be reflected in the decision in the Arab effort.
And here is the problem if Israel implements the decision immediately.
We can say that in a decision.
But Israel has not implemented this resolution.
Now, are we ready to go and ask for Chapter VII? I know that there are difficulties, of course.
It is not questioned by the international community, and if it is questioned
Shyly
The situation
They believe that what they did was right against the Jews or the Israelis.
They will get their right
The current Arab situation
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council
They agree on a summit and make difficult decisions.
And Western countries will seek us out.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world, among people, and you can see how the Arab street is moving on this issue.
But this decision is important.
The case of our presidents being summoned one after the other
It means okay, and in the end they said, “Oh, it turned out there was nothing, it was a false alarm.”
Okay, if we were like Germany or something else now, would we demand?
They don’t have to pay compensation to those who attacked me, meaning that everything you do is based on false information.
and kills hundreds of thousands
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We, as Arabs, have gone against each other.
How to strive
Remove the topic
It was fate and destiny, and it was over.
If the Arab nation says that if you send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur.
Arabs considered, or some considered, the decision to be 1860.
The group worked hard to get the decision out.
What was issued by the Security Council
I don’t want to say that it is a victory or that it is not a victory.
The end justifies the means.
Let's assume that the victory
What are we going to do?
We assume that we are the rest and that we are not bound by the decision.
But I assure you that we will comply with the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to comply with it, but you should not comply with the decision.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted.
That means we
Will you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don’t think the Arab nation
In the current situation, it is ready for any alternative.
I don’t think the Arab nation is ready.
In enforcing the Gaza blockade
for other political purposes
To make one group prevail over another in Palestine, instead of reconciling them with each other.
We started trying to plan
Once they held a meeting, I don’t know, some Arab-European intelligence gathering or something, without mentioning names.
And once they did, we were already participating.
in implementing
What the West expects from us
But we have to go
This means that I want it to be sorted.
I mean, of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about
The consequences are because this issue started two years ago, the issue of Gaza is not new.
I was going to talk about this two years ago, but specifically about the decision itself.
Do you have any reservations about its terms?
Issued and implemented
We were not invited.
They may also think that we have a different point of view.
Everyone was supposed to have the same point of view.
We don't have to all share the same opinion, but I think that those who went there made an effort.
And we thank them for it.
With regard to what has been happening in Gaza for two years, I said that parties
Giving preference to one group over another that participated in the topic of the siege of Gaza
You already agree with the statements, insinuations or accusations that have been made here and there.
about real Arab collusion in everything that is happening now in Gaza
So we are aware of a part of it.
Let me tell you what the topic is, and we don’t know everything.
But I know.
The Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
It sparked anger both domestically and internationally.
And if it had not been for the fact that they did not differ in this way, it would not have been inflamed.
It was after the elections that took place.
Hamas's thirst for power
by a majority
We assume that if we gave them a chance, we would see.
Do they want reform? Or are they still revolutionaries? In the sense of revolution, they only know guns and fighting.
But the day they came
Some of our Arab brothers believe that this radical movement should not come to power.
Now some of them say that there was an attack.
Hamas has already obtained it, or the Palestinians from Gaza, who broke the truce, have broken it.
The truce
The people of Gaza and the Palestinian people have been starving for two years.
It’s okay
for Israeli security reasons
Okay, it’s clear that we don’t want them in power. This doesn’t concern me, I’m in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
What And then who will decide?
These are all countries that have sovereignty in choosing.
The two governments
It is the core of the problem.
But I'm sure it could be treated.
If we tried, we tried to resolve the conflict.
But it is clear that we were required to make one group prevail over another because of this group.
A category that we consider to be terrorist, or what we consider to be
All of this is what happened.
And also, even the promises they made to the party that they will live with are appropriate.
They didn’t do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts being made to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has so far rejected.
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
those Egyptian efforts
No, it’s definitely not a detour.
It has an important role to play
And Egypt also borders Israel and Palestine.
that we
And now we have to stop the chaos.
In Gaza, we need people to stop the chaos in Gaza.
This is not the way to peace.
There must be
And that is why we always ask her to play a bigger role.
What was announced
This means that the initiative cannot be evaluated now.
It can give the possibility of success or study.
I think it has a chance of success.
If the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt can
They are narrowing the differences in Palestinian views.
And whoever discusses the initiative assumes that the injured party is in Gaza.
Because he is the only one who can say yes and can say no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was adopted
We have a Palestinian Arab problem.
We don’t want to hear one side.
But I wish that when the Palestinian delegation went
And when they went to university, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
So that they can now show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are one with them.
This is an important point.
We don’t make the salad
It is our goal to protect and we build our policy.
Staying in power
Sheikh Al-An
I mean, I don’t know if it is possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you have not read its terms, but
Do you think, in principle, that it could be a mechanism for implementing UN resolution 1860, as some have said?
A balanced role
It’s not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow now.
Every day that passes
The blood of our brothers is being shed there.
We don’t want to stretch this issue, nor do the Israelis want to stretch it until they finish their project. Then we will start to present this initiative.
And I am sure that the Brothers in Egypt are aware of this and are keen on it.
And this is what I want to clarify: everything I say
We need to solve this problem now.
And not as Israel wants
pointing out this Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis
Does that mean it's an expression?
On an Arab vacuum
There was no doubt that the position was remarkable.
It has an Arab depth
There is an Arab weakness in her entry, there is an Arab weakness.
We know that there is an Arab deficit.
partly because of disagreements
Partly because of everyone's views, each person thinks that their view is the best.
And so-and-so thinks that his point of view is better.
And there is no consensus on how to make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision.
And they will not single us out one by one.
One says, “No, it’s okay, let’s give them two or three more days so that we can call them and bring the group, and they will be ready and we can solve the problem.”
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have made mistakes, but we will settle accounts with Hamas.
Arabic Arabic
But now
At least we can tell them no.
In the context of the position, Qatar is also required to take a position, as we hear. We will return to this point.
At the same time, you also heard this on the ground.
Khaled Mashal, yesterday the head of Hamas' political bureau
First, it is not necessary that every time brother Khaled Mashal speaks, I have to respect and appreciate him.
Why don’t we sit down with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
We will bring him to the Arab League and tell him.
This is important information.
from Hamas
Imposing Israeli conditions also means imposing conditions.
Let them impose conditions, i.e. they are not allowed to impose conditions, but Israel is allowed to impose conditions.
First, what do you think about this Arab popular uprising?
These are rabble or these are masses, we shouldn’t listen to them. Once they told me that Diqol didn’t listen to them.
It is completely different. De Gaulle first liberated his country.
With allies and without allies, he liberated his country from Nazi occupation.
Now we are the ones who are talking about it.
The Arab gift is what we assume.
Presidents are supposed to represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations that we have witnessed
can be met by these rows of demand
Many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation also demand
Given what is happening, the office and the representation are still open.
They too speak the same logic.
By severing relations, we are acting in line with all the Arab countries.
To sever all relations, even if someone says he has a treaty with him.
They just want Qatar to be sacrificed
that we
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but also in this and in more difficult decisions.
from this decision
This means that we must have a unified Arab position.
to others
No one sells anyone to anyone because they expect to gain something from it, whether it be moral, material, or otherwise.
Yes, before we close this file, there are also countries that have taken individual steps in this matter.
Good. Chavez’s topic is different. Chavez has a dispute with America.
What our people need is for us to call upon them.
Five ambassadors of the permanent great members presented arguments. These are movies.
We finished it now the street is smarter than that
headed by His Excellency Sheikh
He calls on the resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter were framed in a single Arab context, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab position that will make people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
Neither do we get motivated.
How will we get Syria, Lebanon and other countries, when there are Arab countries that do not speak to each other?
There has to be
A qualitative shift in Arab relations
This is the policy that exists now between the Arab countries.
The list is there, but I think my powers have expired.
In the goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese composition is.
Lebanon There is no doubt that
She gave an example of the return of her lands.
The situation in Gaza is different. The situation in Gaza is different. They are still
Trapped on all sides
and this siege
Gives it a different nature
Yes, I mean here the goals for Israel, i.e. the goals of the operation for Israel.
The day you hit so-and-so, the day you punish so-and-so, the day you are pleased with so-and-so.
So what happened in Lebanon is not a good example for them.
The model of the solution that took place in Lebanon
She considers him suitable.
For Gaza
See the problem in Gaza, or or, the solution for the Palestinians is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
We have different opinions on whether we should get our land back today or tomorrow.
My disagreements with the authorities
Distribution of power
This is different because their fabric is closer to each other.
of the intellectual fabric in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is easier.
And that's the problem.
His Eminence Sheikh
This means that we only have a few minutes left to summarize this topic and see where we can go from here.
And a diplomat means
How can this process end?
for Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
He may be refusing
And we help
It didn’t work for us.
It failed to be ours, we Arabs.
Strategically speaking
But on the Palestinian side,
There have been some efforts, but we have not seen a comprehensive initiative.
Neither before nor now, why?
The issue is not so much about initiative as it is about how we feel.
Whoever solves the problem, we will help without mentioning the name of Qatar, because some people may be sensitive to the name of Qatar.
And our goal is not to bring a summit, because we have a summit that will be held in March.
If we take an initiative, will we be better than our brothers? I don’t think so.
We do not put pressure on them.
Because history will not forgive us if we put pressure on them.
So, we are moving forward with this initiative. We have seen all the parties. There was a meeting scheduled for the fourth, but it was postponed because of the trip to the Security Council.
We hope that we will make progress, God willing. We hope that our Arab brothers will help us as much as possible in this matter.
We hope to keep him away from the subject of competition.
Arabic Arabic
which was inflamed at one time by their dispute with the Sudanese government.
And this is also one of our problems, okay, we fight among ourselves, we disagree among ourselves.
I don't want to get involved in this topic.
I think it was on the 19th of this month in Kuwait. Of course, the situation in the Arab world is as follows:
As you know, and as you have mentioned and explained yourself
Does the entire Arab climate help? Is this the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, we always attend any summit held by any Arab brother.
We always have reservations about attending any summit.
But is there not a fear that it will turn into a political summit?
Of course, given that time imposes itself.
It’s too late, even if it’s after ten days.
We are talking about Palestinians after they have been beaten for twenty-five days without eating.
It means that it is
Isn't it said that the Arabs were unable to meet?
That’s what we said.
That’s what we said.
With all due respect, this summit is scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab Street is upon us
The way we are going about it
So that means I
And we acknowledge

Thank you viewers for watching.
And goodbye. The coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
in Doha and contribute to the preparation of the special law draft
She was also a member of many local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has also given more than seventy-five lectures, working papers, presentations and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Let's first agree on the term currently used.
To refer to people with disabilities, should we say people with special needs or, as I said, people with disabilities?
Now, first of all, good evening.
Because people with disabilities have taken a rights-based approach or a human rights culture.
Because it treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
His disability was therefore the result of his attempt to adapt to society.
Then the medical concept prevailed.
Then the concept turned into a concept
The science of special education and special education appeared.
This category has become
We now call them people with special needs.
These are the standard rules from which it is derived.
Role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document
Then the pace accelerated until the international agreement emerged, which was legally binding and distinguished itself from the rules in this regard.
And I set a basic condition or a fundamental rule for this term.
who treats these people as human beings, as people, as individuals.
With a change in terminology, as you mentioned, is there a change in the perception of this category of society?
Yes, and it is measured
It varies from one region to another.
But the special thing about this is
The Arab world has been distinguished or different.
However, the legal approach exists, and the culture of human rights exists, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably due to a lack of financial resources, aren't they?
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: culture exists, but there is a lack of resources. Sometimes there is a lack of political will.
Sometimes the legislation, but
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low, and a culture of rights does not exist.
Ten percent of the world's population has disabilities.
Eighty to ninety per cent of persons with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment.
This is what I mean by my visit to Darfur.
He, despite the mines and weapons
Males are slightly better.
People with disabilities are located in remote areas, in distant regions.
So there are many trends among organizations working in this field that are trying to raise
Awareness is the realization of the right to education.
Instead of creating many religious centers, so to speak.
He says that it creates rehabilitation centres, hospitals and schools.
And this is one of the things that, thank God, we have achieved through our work in the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the State of Qatar.
Set an action agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations so that they include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of people with disabilities in the world
I cannot call it that or agree with you that there is a decline.
If it is declining in the Arab region, it is because of the issue of disability.
Put it in the social context within the political context within the economic context we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be
They are also marginalized groups.
So in a country like, let's say, Gaza, or in Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely say that there has been no improvement in the situation.
And it is actually translated on the ground, for example, if I can give an example.
Like the Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects should be implemented.
For people with disabilities who have health problems within that strategy, there are other projects.
We tried to include it as well.
Work of ground-based organizations
We are now with Om Kamel from Syria. Welcome, Kamel.
Good evening, Suleiman Qaru.
Suleiman Karrou: Excuse me, please go ahead, Suleiman.
My best regards to you and to the respected Mrs. Hafsa.
First, is there a mental disability included in the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual disability means that a healthy person, as a result of some pressure, became a factor of pressure and was exposed to an intellectual disability.
He became disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment. He has had an intellectual disability ever since. He has been receiving treatment for six years now.
I know about four hundred people, both children and adults, who are disabled as a result of imprisonment.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
I mean, that's the truth.
They know it as they know their own children.
And everyone means intention, meaning intention without without without without making themselves named.
There are values in the West.
Agreed but people
Whoever understands that people who have apostatized or turned away from Islam cannot be taken as a source of wisdom.
Thank you very much, Nayef Al-Saeed, who spoke to us from Kuwait.
I return to our guest to comment on what was said
Communications Suleiman wondered if there was a mental disability.
Yes, it is included in the classification.
The global disability certainly includes intellectual and mental disabilities, as it is called.
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or auditory disabilities, and motor disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, disability is
Action and reaction occur within a specific social context.
in the Arab world or in any other region
It is certain that dealing with disability has taken a long time.
And even at the level of the United Nations
For example, there are things that I tried to address and work on during my experience and work as a Special Rapporteur.
In the sense of the right for all
so that He may prepare for them
Various preparatory courses to ensure their entry into schools, as well as work through the Labour Organisation.
It works on vocational rehabilitation that includes people with disabilities.
Some improvements have been made to it.
especially after the reform
It is generally present in this international body.
I too, as a Special Rapporteur, mean
This is a fact of my work, and it was positive for me, even if it was not directly related.
which supported this position
I saw him at many meetings, for example, the international convention.
Rights of persons with disabilities
This means that it is hindered by some of these restrictions or limitations.
For example, with regard to legal capacity
This is one of the fundamental points in the world of disability that
The United Nations unfortunately hindered it to a great extent during the preparation and formulation.
With regard to organizations and agencies
For example, I will end with this.
The world Governments, non-governmental organisations, member states of the United Nations
We sent another questionnaire
United Nations organizations and agencies in the various regions
In order to know to what extent disability programmes are on their agendas
If you are setting budgets, if there is participation of people with disabilities
Human rights
It is not just a development issue.
Okay, we are receiving more calls. We have with us now Mashri Naji from Algeria. Go ahead, Naji.
Peace be upon you too.
I wanted to ask my sister where exactly in Algeria she is from, from Oussouf.
I wanted to ask, I am originally a person with a physical disability.
Okay, we will ask her that question. Naji Mashri spoke to us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Al-Halabi from Greece, please, Ahmed.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Health care, housing, seasonal clothing, even taking them on seasonal trips, this is what happens in Europe.
Is a psychiatric patient considered disabled?
especially if they may cause harm to others or to themselves
Everything we're talking about is in the realm of unproductive debate. Thank you.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial shortfall.
especially in poor countries in Africa and Latin America, and I call upon them
Establish an international disability support fund and allocate one percent of the net profit of every company in the world.
This is mandatory and there are no exceptions for any institution or company.
Many disabled people, victims of war and so on will be deprived of their livelihood and sustenance.
Thank you very much, Ab Ibrahim Abdullah, who spoke to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri wonders and reviews his problem. He is disabled.
at the local or national level, i.e. through Algeria.
The needs within a community must be met within that community.
These are the same rights that should be afforded to any other person.
In other words, the right to life comes first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
I therefore call from this rostrum upon Governments, and Arab Governments in particular,
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual
To ensure
These needs and rights are already included in existing agendas.
No, there is no need to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or not necessary if this is the country.
It can and indeed must be committed to performing
I advise him first to return and go back to the responsible authorities at the government level if possible.
Because this is within the national scope and must be done within this scope.
You mentioned the international convention for people with disabilities. There are many signatory countries, but they do not comply.
Here we ask a question posed by one of the callers who asked why there are no laws.
It is definitely true that we live in a human society, which means there is a lot of error and a lot of correctness.
There are certainly many agreements and many charters, but there is no literal commitment to them.
It is an ideal commitment that many countries have joined, such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we are aware of that.
But the question is whether we should adopt a convention and join it.
First, we will at least ensure that there is awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid, which is the decision makers.
and officials, and then gradually extends to society as a whole.
It is also a question of our commitment to prepare reports, and these reports reach the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and increased awareness
You worked as a rapporteur for the United Nations, according to reports. Is that true?
Yes, from what I have seen and recorded, there is interest.
I therefore believe that there is a comparative advantage in ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
So I advise, encourage and call upon
This means that it is also important for people with disabilities
We will hear what Ali Abid Al-Sinari, president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf, has to say.
The dumb man is being talked about by Mr. Naji Segherna. Welcome, Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Hello
Peace be upon you too.
I am with Mr. Ali Obaid Al-Sinari, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
headed by His Highness Sheikh Hassa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability
Kassim from the State of Qatar
And the fact is that the president of the board, Sheikha Hessa, has a long history.
The international agreement you are talking about now is actually the truth.
It is a great benefit for all people with special needs around the world.
Especially in the Arab world
I hope and I wish as a deaf person
that these States should implement this international agreement
which would serve people with special needs and it is necessary that
In fact, there should be someone who activates this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sinari is the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Dumb.
We stop at

Dear viewers, welcome back. Our guest for today’s episode is Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
A fund for people with disabilities at the international level
Disability, and all countries would be obliged to provide funds. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Cases Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Monitoring mission to implement standard rules
When I worked these six years, there was no support to speak of.
except from China and Austria
It always means that I thank this country for this support.
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
She founded the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, thanks to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
I mean, as we said at the beginning, this point is always raised.
the situation of ordinary people
How do we care for people with disabilities or care for the disabled?
This means that there is a realistic, genuine and serious commitment.
All of it, in all its conditions and in all its categories
People with disabilities Children Women Migrants Refugees
If we do all this, we will actually reach a level of what is called
Equal opportunities, participation and equality
And there are those voices that always demand and never tire or get weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't you allocate a part? Excuse me.
In support of these programmes and projects
He presented the truth as it is, and I thank him from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
as part of the budget allocated to it
This non-compliance you mentioned regarding the payment of financial dues
Does the money to help people with disabilities only include developing countries and Arab countries, or does it also
Even developed countries do not offer
The person who was before me, the Swede, is the one I mean. Yes.
And also some countries from the European Union
And of course, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not have
You even know that this Special Rapporteur exists.
In my case, I mean, what happened is
It was Sweden and China.
Unfortunately, there were also many promises in the Arab region, but unfortunately there was only one country.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have more calls. Hamad Al-Meri from Qatar, go ahead, Hamad.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Hello Dr. Sheikha Hessa
Almost ten years
We now notice that this girl has a psychological disability.
So what is your role in relation to a girl like this who is suffering?
She is with her colleagues.
With means sometimes even if we stay
So what is your role in relation to Qatari girls?
Many thanks, Hamad Al-Meri spoke to us from Qatar, Karwan Bahjat from Kuwait, welcome.
As they say, Sheikha Hessa.
Why don’t we leave our oil in its dregs?
We can count the number of Arabs with special needs.
We can help them.
We have tremendous financial resources.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
By reviving the individual's morale
And they consult it for this noble purpose.
This is if we are really believers.
Thanks and appreciation to Sheikha Hessa for her efforts and for what she has done during her tenure as Special Rapporteur.
With our thanks and appreciation to her and to the State of Qatar for all they have done for people with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed, who spoke to us from Qatar.
Hello, Professor Wasila.
And peace be upon you.
And your noble job
Her Excellency Sheikha Hessa
My question is about prevention.
Prevention is better than cure, as they say.
There is another level of disability, regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
And at the genetic level, it may be the result of a shortcoming on the part of families, namely, marriage between relatives.
I think this is a high percentage.
leads to disability
Thank you very much, flag bearer Sharif, who spoke to us from Tunisia. I will return to you, our guest.
The first caller, Hamad Al-Meri, asked
Where does he go? He has a girl with a disability, a psychological disability.
He wonders where he is going.
In every country
There are definitely services provided for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities, as we said, or any psychological disabilities.
This is for schools
In the past, there was
Is it special education or do I mean the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council?
Flag bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed out a very important point.
Scientific papers and others
b) Programmes not only for organisations working with disabilities, but also within campaigns.
Women's programs
All of this has led to many campaigns and reproductive health programs.
I talked about this aspect
Adopts health strategies
raises awareness
The risks of consanguineous marriage
and genetic factors
I think it applies in the State of Qatar.
And with customs and traditions, but it definitely takes time.
Especially in tribal communities
But over time there will be a response to it, but it is necessary that there be a legal obligation, meaning
Yes, Karawan Bahjat asked and suggested that one percent of the budget of the Arab countries be allocated.
To help people with disabilities, let me start first.
Yes, there is a statistical estimate that the World Health Organization applied to the world as a whole.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are doubling.
For example, there is a study in South Africa that has seen and proven this.
The statistics that have emerged about the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza are certainly true.
For every person killed, there are three people who are disabled.
And since our Arab region has become an undisputed area of conflict
So even the proposal made by Bahjat Karwan
That means one percent will not be enough.
To help people with disabilities in the Arab region if
This issue of proportion applies to people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Honestly and sincerely, I don’t think it agrees.
which require that their problems and needs be addressed
She stressed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Surveys conducted by Governments generally do not count persons with disabilities
This is true, and it is also related to the culture of society and sometimes to restrictions.
Community means when a population census is conducted by
The competent authorities
about having a disabled person in the house at home
There was only one question: is there a disabled person or not?
The department responsible for this matter is the one that deals with it through the relevant officials.
We cooperated in preparing a form.
We recommended that there should be more details.
First, explain whether this disabled person is male or female, if they exist.
Does his assistant get paid or not?
Because even the number, as you know, is correct, why haven't we reached the exact result?
The interest is also in the progress of Fatima Al-Dosari, who is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
Peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with disabilities.
I thank the ruler of the country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Her Highness Sheikha Moza, for embracing this group.
I am really proud of the care and attention I receive.
on its important role
Latifa Al-Musaifri, please go ahead.
Because they represent a major obstacle in society without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Musifri from Qatar, we have Naseem with us.
Abdulkarim from Jordan, please go ahead, Naseem.
Please, Karim, we’re listening to you.
Peace be upon you too.
Thank you. I actually have a comment.
First of all, I am an audiologist and I worked in Qatar for about four years.
We also had the month of awareness about hearing and speech problems and
We used to hold conferences, lectures and awareness campaigns on hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I have been living in Jordan for almost three years.
Frankly, it offers new and wonderful services.
Frankly, Bsaraha offers new services, whether they are material, non-material, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, I mean, in terms of resources.
affiliated to the Ministry of Education in public schools
We are also private institutions.
We receive wonderful and beautiful support.
Okay, Karim, do you have a direct question? I apologize for the lack of time.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, in the UAE, Jordan, these are great services and, in my opinion, they are excellent.
Comment on what was said in the viewers' communications
It means someone who works in this field.
B Regarding the subject
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
which, upon ratification and accession, become binding
and as a duty incumbent upon this State or upon these organizations
because it stems from the issue of rights for these people, regardless
And frankly, what
what was done for the disabled during that period
And now you wish it would come true.
Of course, I hope that either
I hope that this research or survey will be used as a benchmark and that more high-quality research will be conducted in this area.
I also realized this from the experience.
Six years of experience
and coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have a role to play; it is not just a matter of rights; they are also recipients of rights.
Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability, I thank you.
We welcome the elegant presenter of Al-Dawry Wal Kass channel, Lana. Good morning, Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the outstanding captain of Umm Salal Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali.
Welcome to Fiji
Good morning
I will leave you the space to congratulate everyone, and everyone will congratulate in their own way. Lana, please go ahead.
I had an open studio for five hours and I had two hours of Apple before that day.
I congratulate the State of Qatar, its land, government and people. They definitely deserve this global achievement.
I got this opportunity to congratulate and congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He and his heir, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, because you are from the sports field, you work in this field, and you are very familiar with these lines and this field.
Because we are too
And competing means that we deserve it. When we got six votes, there were fourteen votes between us and America, eight for America and eight for Qatar.
It’s not because of the night, because our file is rich, comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors. It is very well supported, let’s say the stadiums.
It means that some people were afraid that it might be like America.
And maybe in some countries these things are already ready, they don’t need to prepare stadiums and prepare some projects related to this event.
Because they are all ready.
But they were afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I expect this to be a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect it will enter the fields of economy, politics and health.
But as athletes
What does this quantum achievement mean?
It’s a great achievement, especially for us as athletes. Even non-athletes, you saw how happy they were.
God willing, Ali told me this at the moment of the announcement.
I swear I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio.
We were waiting for him, and I had one of my friends with me.
We were driving in the car and listening to the radio.
First, they announced it on Qatar and
We both screamed and, of course, closed the opening.
My friend came out of the hole.
Screams and the whole world is watching our work, danger and the march is in our soul.
We have been on a journey from the beginning.
Thank God, it was a very special day, I think, and all the channels probably focused on this event a lot.
Lana, you must be involved in this topic.
especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this and what was their reaction?
There were media outlets from many channels around the world.
A major landmark that has already become visible on the map is known as Qatar.
Of course, Ali also means that the player's presence in the team is very important.
I expect that this is a responsibility that largely rests on his shoulders.
What do you think about this point in particular?
Okay, Captain Ali, what are the characteristics that this player must have in order to be part of this team?
Now there are more than one upcoming sporting events on the way.
And now we need to create a strong generation.
It has meaning, it has basic rules, and it has mathematical techniques that are applied in football in a studied manner.
What are the rules and fundamentals that this player must have?
I think professionalism guarantees everything.
Commitment to exercise Regular exercise Discipline
These are all basic things that help the player to give his best in matches or in training.
I think every stage has its own meaning and its own special character.
She has her own concerns and feelings.
From different programs, from variety to sports, which one is the most beautiful for you? Where did you feel yourself the most?
It’s really nice, by God.
It really makes you take care of yourself. You know how I want to take care of myself through sports. That’s the most important thing.
Then you have football, which is loved by the fans. Everyone follows it, whether you like it or not. When you enter this field, you have to start loving it.
What confines the media to one side of us?
What confines you like this puts you on a certain side.
It’s not a requirement to be a fan, just football.
Neither sports nor medicine are good, sports are not good.
I also have a few important things I’d like to talk about.
I didn’t want you to come back like this, to be ten years younger to reach two thousand and twenty-two.
I never wished for this job.
Of course, we all hope for that, especially since the World Cup means that any player now
Imagine that just watching a World Cup match makes one happy, so imagine how it would be to play in the World Cup.
I hope they will live up to expectations, God willing, and this is their chance, God willing.
What is the word you would like to say to a professional player who is rotten? What is the word you would like to say to them from your heart?
We wanted you to be with us during this period.
I swear it’s just like what it is now, meaning a vacation.
His return to championships after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You definitely have a beautiful mark, Mashallah, from Qatar TV and beautiful memories.
Mashallah, it means that Qatar TV has now become like a university that graduates a large number of media professionals.
Our team is a strong team, God willing, it will win many different awards.
Let’s talk about a job with the mission of Umm Salal Club.
How are you doing there? How are you? I hope you are comfortable.
Sure, thank God, frankly, Umm Aslal.
Yesterday, of course, he was with us in the studio and we talked a lot about the players.
I expect that some of the young people who are following us still feel that you are one of them.
Required
It means that in the Qatari professional league, players play naturally and transfer.
I think I got my chance in the show, whether it was a good or a bad one.
I was able to take the place of the Asian Cup with the team, thank God.
Thanks to God, my situation with the team is good.
Sports topic: how can we make it a social issue?
And Qatar changed how we can introduce sports to women, to children, to young people.
It connects them together, meaning everything complements sports.
In various sports, women have no role to play.
Now we have a sports awareness that is spread among every individual in this society, from the youngest to the oldest.
It’s almost a year until we reach this occasion, or I think it’s twelve years until we reach this occasion. I think it’s enough time.
Because our new generations keep coming out on the road.
A generation is passing and growing up, but there is a generation after it that also needs to be educated about sports from a young age.
About us Aspire is a monument, something unique that we cannot deny, a great monument.
One real number for the new generation of sports
We just have to set our intentions and get started.
And they love football in particular
How do I get the audience to keep in touch with all the different games, even between clubs?
I swear, this is a problem we have in the Qatari league, which is the lack of fans.
But we have this problem of attendance, the Qatari Federation has not yet found a solution to attract the fans.
What is the method we should use to attract them to watch these matches?
It depends on the person himself, some people don't like to go to the stadium.
The media plays a key role in the idea of public abstention.
And now they have created a ticket system or a point collection system, a system that collects points.
Lala is a union, which means he has a multi-step plan to attract the masses.
Some clubs have ways to attract fans, like Al-Rayyan. Of course, Al-Rayyan is rich, so they don't need fans.
Some clubs need some club management to do activities, to do events.
The public's right The public's right is an incentive, but I think these are the means we have.
Players mean the new generation
Their love for the job, their belief in their abilities, and just like the team, it’s not just financial support, moral support is very helpful too.
We definitely thank you for this good meeting, Mashallah.
So we wanted to get your final words on the occasion of this wonderful victory, of course, Qatar's victory in the bid for the 2022 World Cup. Please, go ahead.
We are sure that Qatar did not insist, on the contrary, it fulfilled its promises and always kept its word.
God willing, Captain Ali, what is the last word you would like to say in this interview?
I say congratulations to them and I hope they will move forward, God willing.
Thank you, Ali Qasim, the captain and the player. We wish you all the best, God willing, in your sports career and in your life as well. May God help you, God willing.
And it made us love sports more and more.
The topic of the episode is young talent.
Some young people think that this period is actually the time of these songs, but they have a very deep and long history.
A group of young people sing Arabic lyrics or English lyrics.
Today we will follow this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them very well through our live meeting with them.
Welcome, viewers, wherever you are.
A new type of singing has been spreading in the Arab and Gulf scene for years.
Coming from the West, specifically from America, it is rap music.
And before we get into the topic of rap singing
There is boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can sing rap
for writing the lyrics of the song
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
In general, all these details are very important, and we will learn about them from two people who are very involved in this field.
They made a nice band
I welcome Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah Youssef Good morning
Welcome Salman, good morning.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program, of course.
And also, of course, through rap music.
What does this have to do with you, Youssef?
We saw that rap music didn’t really exist in Tripoli.
The most delicious Batargha
In the citizen's own words
Some of them are cheerful, some are sad, and some deal with political issues.
Yes, I am the first rapper
I think these songs are a form of art, just like a painter paints a picture, a poet writes a poem.
A singer can sing, a musician can play any instrument.
You can feel that this type of music is accepted by Qatari society and Gulf society.
Two thousand and ten
You feel that people have started to like to own rap music CDs.
different ages
And there are families, and there are many people who have started listening to more than one country.
It was like a website.
And how many of you are in this band so far?
This means that everyone can say words, write poetry and perform it in a rap style.
The rapper is like God, as you say, you can say that he sings about himself.
He is the one who sometimes plays and he is the one who writes the lyrics.
Oh okay.
Listen to it, I swear to God I recorded this song.
Okay, now all these songs that I produced, from Salman, from you, from Yusuf, from anyone, from the band itself.
Did you think it would be available on a certain CD sold in the markets?
But you know that when you are a celebrity, it means that I will go and make an album and put it on the market, so this is difficult, a commercial record and procedures, you know.
Okay, why didn’t you think that you are twenty-five people? One hand can’t clap alone.
You have twenty-five hands, Mashallah. May God protect you all as young people and brothers.
Make a CD. You can promote this CD through more than one website on the internet.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have it through local newspapers.
I think there are thirteen songs.
Registration is not available at the moment.
It’s a bit old, but it was clear.
The quality is a bit poor, but it’s not the same as it is now, but it’s clear.
It is almost fifty CDs.
It means that I cannot say that it does not exist, because some young people may have known this art for ten years.
I’m in the recording phase now and I expect to distribute it in this period. It’s different now.
And especially that there is a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music types now.
These are the young people or these are the artists who produce a large number of beautiful songs.
We also want to talk about the concerts you participated in.
And God, look at the party we attended in Doha, we only participated in one party.
Of course, it was organized for us by Al-Sadd Club, so they didn’t mess with us.
Go and see the audience.
Let’s see something, we didn’t expect this number.
What surprised us was that there were more families.
Families are more important than young people.
It was organized from to and it was amazing.
We were a little confused, it was our first time in Doha.
That means we expect there will be no demand.
But the audience's reaction was amazing.
It was a long period of time, the benefits of songs, I mean.
Okay, let’s listen to something or the lyrics of one of the songs they wrote, for example, and that was released to the public and was well received by young people in particular.
Let’s listen to some words, for example, so that we can also show them to the viewer.
And we can hear it on the air.
Please, take your time.
Welcome Salem
The problem is that my words are a little bit...
Let’s hear it.
I don’t know.
We now have the Doha Morning Show with us.
One should wake up in the morning with a good mood.
Salman is like a mountain, he has been in rap for five years.
Even if one doesn’t accept to be poor, he still is.
I brought a lot of people to their senses.
I need to translate some words.
Okay, the songs you sang, for example, give me a sentence from one of the sentences you said, for example.
You see, not all songs are random, what he just said is what they call freestyle in English.
meaning at the same weight
But when we sing a song, I mean, I write the lyrics with meaning.
Thank you, let’s follow up on it.
We can say good morning to my country, good morning to Qatar, with the Doha Morning program.
Stay with us, we are live on air for the viewers.
They will see one, two, one, and then they will show a little bit of art.
We have the Doha Morning Show
Of course, the beautiful song you saw
I am now insisting that the young people above should be present online and everywhere.
It really cheers you up, when did you record it?
It was common, it was shared.
Each one of us is with the other, each one is accustomed to himself.
I feel that Youssef cannot accept my words a little, or take them, or cannot implement them.
Everyone takes words
We certainly expect that every artist, every painter, and every poet is always
He can also write about his love for sports.
In love with the homeland itself
You must have participated in the National Day through the march.
Through beautiful songs, you, as young Qataris, also represent Qatar.
Doha is preparing to host the Asian Cup, of course, and there is a big parade on the Corniche.
To receive this event
And we are bringing you these images of the reception, of course.
Doha welcomes the Asian Cup
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these live shots together.
To receive them, but in the same place where these crowds are, where our children, the students, are.
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport early this morning to complete
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let’s go back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, who are lighting up the studio.
Wahma is a Qatari Gulf Arab rap band, that’s right.
We can say that about you.
And God, I mean, that’s what we are now, you know.
I want to plan a party, but I’m not sure.
But now you are working on a specific party and it will be announced, God willing, Youssef.
Inshallah, but it’s not certain yet, we’re still at the beginning of the journey.
At the beginning of the journey, we wish you all the best and I am sure that our program will support you, God willing, with all our hearts.
Salman also means where you all gather as young people, twenty-five people.
Where do you have the meeting and how do you put the ideas together and how do you write them together?
There definitely needs to be some joint songs.
It doesn’t have to be one person, for example Salman or Youssef or any one of them singing a whole song.
There must be some harmony between you, when you meet and when you meet.
You know, it’s really hard to gather twenty-five people all at once.
I started talking to Youssef and talking to so-and-so and talking to them because we might meet up somewhere today.
To see the idea of the song and the lyrics
And there is a second way too
I’m writing down what’s on me.
Send it to him and he will complete it.
This will be yours, finally. Youssef will record, reply, and send me a message soon.
You will see the experiences that exist outside.
Take it means you get some CDs from great artists.
Take some experience, take some techniques from them, I mean.
Yeah, that’s for sure, we always do.
Artists who have been in this field for years or have experience and a position in this field.
One listens to them, sees their methods, their ways, and tries to create a style, meaning he doesn’t imitate them.
What I mean is, if I use the same style, the same tone of voice, and the same level of words as him, what would happen?
I'm just imitating, I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something that's special to me.
It means we should use them a little.
Yes, I also expect that there is a large group of young Gulf people in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive way, we will follow this report together, benefit from it, and also enjoy watching it with each other.
The mystery still surrounds the talent that some people possess.

You know that drilling wells is expensive.
But with an expert, he can determine the right place to dig the well.
Of course, the way to discover or

She has been like that since ancient times.
They were our ancestors and our ancient forefathers.
They hire experts to determine the location of the wells.

Now we are practically applying the process of discovering water streams.
It starts now, go back, turn around, this is the end of the stream.
Come back again
Come back, come back.
The reason for this is that if it comes from here, we put a mark.
And here the watercourse ends.
It requires a lot of experience and a lot of patience.

Of course, this is the method and how to use the copper rods.
Of course, there is no precise scientific explanation for this.
This way
It is surprising that the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession is high.

Detection of shallow groundwater reservoirs
Glory be to God, who taught man what he did not know. This is, of course, a report that we received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They made a special band for them and now they have more than one CD.
Whether it’s on the internet or some of them are on the phone
There is sometimes competition between the Gulf countries, between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, between Qatar and
Can you release a stronger song about a stronger topic?
About a problem, about, about, etc. Many topics.
Follow him or see my idol, I mean see that there is nothing
Inshallah
And at the same time, we want to take this
It also means a large collection of songs.
We are trying as much as possible to spread it.
Every now and then, let’s keep in touch like this.
We also want to know the latest news about this band first.
But I insist on the name of the band.
Rubber Qatar
We will come back again and our guests will be there and we will go back to the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere
We are definitely with you live through the direct link that we are broadcasting to you, our viewers.
Wherever you are on the Corniche, welcome to the Asian Cup.
We are definitely proud of them and proud of the different arts.
It addresses many social and psychological problems among young people.
But Yoona is in Studio Two.
They will definitely complete the twenty-five.
Welcome again, Abu Yusuf and Salman. May God bless you again.
Subscription will be stopped once
We are trying to reach the company, but we don’t know where it is and no one is answering us.
She needs to develop herself, at least the one who is outside should be the one who does that.
Facebook YouTube
I mean sites like this one.
In the name of the band
We received two, we are always available.
You are organized, as we have seen with each other, Mashallah, you have done this work.
You make these songs and put them on a set of pictures, your own personal pictures.
And upload it to YouTube, upload it to websites where there might be videos that people can follow.
God, we stayed there before.
And there are a lot of songs, you know.
The obstacles you are facing are that there is no website and you need a company to sponsor you.
You really need a place that brings you together as a band.
What are your wishes that you really want to come true and reach the high level you wish for?
So, we’ve finally got it.
You tell us, "Come on, we'll count for you, we'll arrange for you, we'll release an album for you."
Does it mean something, something official?
Because it’s a period of five years now.
It just means a lot.
Yes, we participated in things, we participated in programs, we participated in series.
I hope that I will develop and become
That means something to us, it means to support us, it means we will always be with him.
Yes, and we also want to know what your wishes are, Salman, other than Youssef's wishes. What can you say?
Almost the only wish is a video clip
God willing, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this band.
You are kind and we hope, God willing, that your songs will always be present in the Arab world and in the world.
And indeed, this is a high art, a highly audible art.
It contains messages, as you mentioned.
Good luck to you always, and we wish you all the best, God willing.
Say hello to the whole group and good luck, God willing.
We will conclude this meeting with the song they made for the program.
With you are KD and DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning Show.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mr. Bobo with his KT-1 and he wants to pray.
We can say good morning to my country, good morning to Qatar, with the Doha Morning program.
Stay with us, we are live on air for the viewers.
And don’t forget that the program is broadcast at 9:30 in the morning, so everyone is sitting in front of the TV.
They will see one, two, one, and then they will show a little bit of art.
We have the Doha Morning Show
We have Hassan Na'ama with us in the preparation and Shima Al-Hammadi with us in the presentation.
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki. The guests of the episode are Rappers Qatar, of course.
It means to be reused again and to be used at home.
It's in the trolley or this shopping cart.
You put in it who is shopping at the supermarket or elsewhere.
Any item you put in the cart, anything you want to buy
You will have a large screen that will show you the components of this item.
This is also a great idea that can be implemented.
It means that just a Baracot scan will work, an icon in the car will detect this item.
It makes it easier for the buyer to buy when you give it to them.
He gets full details on a special screen for him.
I expect that there will be more health awareness like this.
When it is in a device with you or in the same car
Most components
And the warnings, what are its harms?
It means that it contains complete details.
He is ambitious, for example, he had a number of projects, maybe four or five.
Solve traffic problems
It addresses traffic congestion and other parking problems, and it was also creative and very nice.
Mashallah, also the cultural center for children.
Let’s talk about the different activities we will see in the coming days, Professor Abdullah.
Yes, by God, there are surprises, of course, but it passed quickly.
My ideas, if you like, I can mention some of the projects that are being presented.
This is, for example, the idea of moving underground, its main idea is smart or creative.
Everyone who leaves their house has a reason to turn around.
And they gather at a certain point
These are all the pictures that the viewers are watching, and I expect them to enjoy them.
Children's creations
Exactly, yes, this is, for example, like the same cash machine.
For women, for example, I have a card.
Insert this card, for example, if you need a black T-shirt.
For example, this is some of the stuff that is missing now in some places, or for example, I have some things missing at home, a key, I don’t know what.
What I meant, for example, was the office keys, the keys
Of course, this is based on the fact that we have a main goal, which is what Her Highness Sheikha Moza wants.
His Highness the Prince's Palace
at an early time period, and this is of utmost importance in project design.
The number was also selected from among three hundred children.
Then we also have promising preachers in Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony, she was a presenter.
We really want to open our hearts and doors to all children who want to present their programs.
Then they go off.
We also need to support this, and their presence is one of our top priorities.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
The diversity and variety of children's skills
Self-development
Okay, do you have such cooperation with some of the different youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also scientific clubs in Qatar.
All our programs are, of course, based on partnerships.
All our programs are specialized partnerships.
It also has community service institutions that specialize in developing these skills.
He is in partnership with all institutions interested in the field.
The Society The Photographic Society
The Girls' Creativity Center and the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very important role.
Yes, he played a major role in explaining Qatar’s vision.
Training children on it
recruit and encourage children, as all our programs are based on institutional partnerships.
depending on the specialization of these projects and institutions
What has changed for you?
Of course, our presence in Katara gave us a strong boost and gave us great support.
Faster and more compact
Now, of course, there are a number of projects in partnership with Katara that are currently being prepared for launch, God willing, over the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
especially when it comes to reading
Head of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are doing it now, especially since we are now in the preparation time.
And to build a promising scientific future for all children, future generations and young people, God willing.
The message I would like to convey to parents, to the young people who follow us, and to the children who would like to be present through the center is:
What we are giving now
Sometimes our children have ideas that we should not belittle or underestimate.
We must pay attention to these ideas, whatever they are.
Because, in fact, anyone who is interested in this idea will develop it. At the very least, we will develop a child’s love of thinking.
It is very important that I take care of my interests.
I communicate with him spiritually. I communicate with him now. Our big problem is that most fathers
He is being supported by him.
He is encouraged, so we urge parents and educators.
That is, they should pay more attention to their imagination. Today's children are our future, they are the origin of this future.
It really means that we lived while we were walking around this exhibition among their projects.
I was living in a dream.
It means that in a dream, all thoughts are very wide imagination.
Now the dream definitely means reality. Many dreams have come true and have become a reality.
Thank God, we wish our children who were present success, God willing.
We have high hopes for you, God willing.
by His permission
of all ages and both sexes
It reached seventy projects
These projects are considered pioneering and new in implementation.
To learn more about this exhibition
National and also about the Cultural Center for Childhood
Professor Abdullah, also at the beginning, tell us briefly about the exhibition.
What does it contain? It certainly brings together many events, so what can we briefly say about this exhibition?
It was a new way for children to express their love, loyalty and belonging to the country.
Of course, it was held under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
This exhibition was featured in the exhibition tour.
He starts growing up with him until he reaches twenty or thirty.
Of course, we started training children to see Qatar 2030 with its five pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development and environmental development
First, he now knows what Qatar means, twenty, thirty, where is it going to reach?
Then he starts thinking about how his way of thinking is.
How does he create and how does he come up with creative ideas?
I expect it to be like this, his field is wide, Mashallah.
But when we give him certain symbols and help him
I expect his thinking will grow even bigger and more.
Professor, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Generations' Dreams, Tomorrow's Realities".
It is the slogan of the dreams of today's generations.
He will be part of the future of Qatar, part of tomorrow's Qatar.
We actually felt this when we were walking with the children. When a child speaks, he speaks to the Minister of Happiness.
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project in twenty thirty.
The child thinks after twenty years
In which he expresses his love for his country and expresses what he loves and adores in his field.
It is certainly accompanied by various activities and competitions.
One of them was the winner of the Stars of Science award.
He was also one of the first prize winners of the League of Arab States.
Of course, all the children.
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were different displays being shown according to a specific schedule.
to present the projects they have done, I mean, during the exhibition.
Mashallah, an excellent presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winning projects that I participated in at the exhibition were winners.
who also won one of the main awards
which is the forest or the reserve
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
Of course, the colored flag was also part of our vision and the children's dream for the future of Qatar.
Also think about twenty, twenty-two.
How can a child contribute to a creative project idea for twenty-two and ten?
Its main idea is to have a chip present in the ball.
Gives color when judged
If, for example, she went there, it means that everyone is watching the referee's movements with the ball.
Or the movements of the player in the field and what changes in it through this electronic chip
which will be present in the ball
Of course, the ideas are creative. Of course, it is the main idea. Many people may be surprised and ask us.
And these are the projects
We always say we can’t get through to the kids.
At this stage of developing or cultivating these skills, they expand their horizons.
Give them an idea of how to express their love for their country through these projects.
Give them the confidence to present their project, face the audience and explain their idea.
In the field of his interests, in something he loves, all of this is considered an achievement, an achievement for him.
The support provided was very meaningful to me and I am grateful for it.
It is now entering the development stages.
With the support of so many officials, the support of the committee, and I also expect the support of the public.
The forest was not the second forest because of this child.
The way subscribers enter the channels, the pipes that visitors enter underground.
A large protected forest
In it, the visitor wanders around to see the animals, sorry, the reptiles under the ground.
And a sensor on some animals and a research center that measures the condition of the animals
And in the marine environment, to enter it in a creative way as well.
The reason for her victory is also the imagination, which is very broad in all its details.
This, of course, led its people to
Of course, there are those who talk about a tourist city under the water.
Who is talking about a city for butterflies?
Who is talking about a forest, a forest above the earth?
Whoever talks about many tourist ideas
It means exciting.
This is probably what children’s minds need now, at this time, maybe in 2030, 2050.
And in the future, maybe these things will actually come true.
That means three projects.
The projects that the science club adopted, he said, are what I need now, I want to work on them.
For example, a project like air conditioning and water.
Let's see the Arab newspaper now.
The news says that Qatar University is celebrating graduation
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President of the University
A good achievement that will definitely be recorded for the beautiful university.
Qatar University and the University of Cagliari
And also this good news that we are reading about our male and female students.
A pioneering academic achievement, God willing, and we wish them success, God willing, in all disciplines, God willing.
He is considered one of the young faces that are strongly emerging in the Qatari drama scene.
And how long, and also categories and colored threads
The artist Abdelhamid Al-Sharshani is considered one of the artists who formed themselves.
If it were not convincing
He would not have been selected to be present in the operations being carried out inside Qatar.
The artist Abdelhamid Al-Sharshani is currently participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Tasaneef" Part Two.
We are pleased to have as our guest this morning
To talk to him about his participation in these two important works and about his experience in general
Welcome and good morning.
You brightened up the Doha Morning Show. Hi, this is the first time I meet you and the first time you are with us on Doha Morning.
And the people who worked hard on the program
And you are Lisa's sister.
Welcome, let’s start the conversation.
Let’s see
I am a responsible man and an administrator.
And apply the laws
All I can tell you is
Bring the cloak
Then listen, why are you coming to me?
Go and see if anyone agrees that you don’t have to return the cloak.
I also had another question to start with, but since we saw this clip from the first part of the series Tasaneef
Indicating that Khalid ibn al-Walid
Some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Mirat.
Many things and information are associated with this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more, we continue with this beautiful report by our colleague Abdulrahman Murshed.
We follow each other
It is certainly a testimony from someone who knows no flattery or favoritism.
Emphasizing the antiquity of this or that city
And as much as we see of its effects and hear what its narrators and poets have said about it
both ancient and modern, this is a glorious record that is added to the city's history.
Marat city is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is an ancient country that historically originated in the pre-Islamic era.
Historians disagree about the reason for its name.
Some attribute it to Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi, the famous poet.
and the pond that is named after him
The date of its creation is unknown.
The Age of Ignorance
The most famous thing in the city of Marat is also Mount Kumayt, which has become proverbial.
Because it is in the city and attached to it.
These are also archaeological sites.
There are many, and this landmark is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Merat made tremendous efforts to work.
From a park above this mountain
and sessions for parents and all residents of the Kingdom
It was named after the great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the Liar
Among her works is also Ghadeer Kamit.
It is a place where floods gather and water is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
Among its effects is also a house that sheds light on heritage.
A city whose history dates back to pre-Islamic times.
It is famous for its poets, whose poetic talent was ignited.
With its beauty, its monuments and its famous mountain, Kamit.
Abdulrahman Al-Murshed on the Doha Morning Show
The city of Marat is north of Riyadh.
We are back again with our esteemed guests.
I wish we and the viewers were informed about these methods and means.
As I said at the beginning, we have a very special infrastructure.
We will open a page for him, he will register and have a private file on our system.
Parent's email
This tweet contains information about increased focus, writing speed, reading speed, and general distraction.
The guardian will have full deception.
Okay, this tweet should be added to the student’s file.
He accessed his son’s file online.
And he sees how much his son is being oppressed.
He can see his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
So we can really enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful child.
We brought most of the children who are in the center and we send them our best regards.
I entered this center with a teacher who is of course present through this center.
And we get to know her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, since she entered this center.
Of course, this year
He focuses on work and then Ramadan.
But of course, this would be unfair to some works at the expense of others, always.
And there are people who only watch TV during Ramadan.
He watches TV and the people worship the TV during the month of Ramadan.
Reduce, reduce, reduce the number of series. Reduce it, let it be done over two years, isn't that better?
Of course
I hope they accept me in Ramadan.
But I hope to send you all my greetings.
And, God willing
And also in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion.
A fashion show was held in the Katara Cultural District.
We will definitely continue with you with all love and honesty.
It further develops children's abilities and skills.
Apart from the different schools that exist in this generous country.
We have a model, and we have definitely spoken to our guests who were with us.
Now we have with us Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam, welcome and good morning.
How are you, Omnia?
Praise be to God
Which page is currently open?
Professor Ibrahim, let’s first get to know what kind of materials are offered through this center.
And as an example of this, there is sister Amniya.
We will also teach her the method or the way that teacher Nesma talked about.
You feel that something has changed in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods
Things were changing in terms of his skills, his mind, even his educational level would change.
Scientific methods
One of them is that I first do a global test called the Tony Test for the child before he starts anything else in my program.
I will start doing the second part of the test now as well.
Through it, we measure the level or the difference in level between students.
We will now do a quick math test or quiz.
Omniyah will calculate and answer live on air.
Of course, Amniya has no idea about these questions at all.
We are obsessed with this topic.
Of course, I had another question to start with.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part
Tell us about your participation.
Of course, after we presented the first season of the series Tasaneef
Of course, thank God, God has blessed me with several roles.
Professor Ghanem
He assigns the roles, of course, together with the executive director Ashraf Shahata and the great professor.
Of course, it is an opportunity from Tar Art Production Company.
Frankly, for the sake of the youth
Of course, Professor Ghanem, this year he nominated me for the possibility.
Of course, every episode is different.
In a few episodes, I will create characters.
On the contrary, it is a nice experience, of course, and we are present at work.
A pyramid of the pyramids of Kuwait, Professor Saad Al Faraj
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah Malik and Ali Al-Ghurair.
We have a proverb like Ali Mirza's proverb.
You also have a group of young people, Abdullah Adham.
So we still have young people like Abdullah Al-Asam.
This has been the case for years; we work on two projects a year.
Maybe that’s why Apple asked you if you’ve been acting since 1997.
But I didn’t know that this thing or your ambition in art would come true.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study art or is it just a hobby?
I didn’t take it as a talent.
I took up art as a talent, of course, the one who supported me at the beginning was the artist Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the artists who considers me as a person like his son.
I have something to talk to him about.
Of course, we are all for the series.
We got up, worked hard, and thank God.
Now, if it wasn’t for Tara, a big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti. A big, big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait, for example, Kuwait has twelve to thirteen new actors every year, so why not us?
They have
Of course, thank you very much, you are giving opportunities.
But let's just say
We are talking about the series Al-Sani Tasaneef. We talked about it and got an idea about it.
The Deadly Feeling Violin
And the foot is also a man's foot.
And we have a model with us, for sure. We have the therapist, Professor Abdulaziz Al-Muaif Al-Tamimi.
so that this process can be broadcast live
Let’s see how we can treat a personality. First of all, let me greet Professor Subhi Abdullah. Welcome.
Welcome. Peace and God’s mercy be upon you.
Let’s start with you, professor. Please go ahead.
God willing
In the name of God, of course.
We hold hands
Let's see the nerves.
As if it were a drawing or a message from God Almighty, showing all the members of your body.
What are its problems from the inside?
Sometimes you get dizzy
Headache and dizziness
Relax your hand, relax, keep your nerves calm, yes.
So, Professor Abdulaziz, you will discover a particular thing through his hand, that he is suffering from a particular disease.
The one on the left has a mild middle ear infection.
In pain, what does that mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
You have a problem with your ear.
Who created me when I was little?
Here I feel pain again.
Sinus
If you press your nose, you will get a headache here.
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
It is causing him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating
It means that his thyroid is a little tired. You are always lazy and sluggish and feel heaviness in your body.
Excessive sleep
There is a lot of sleep or laziness, the body always feels heavy.
Constant tonsil inflammation
Look, you can see the tremor. Do you notice the tremor?
He has stress, and of course you never walk barefoot, maybe the last time.
The brother is from Tunisia.
Mashallah, you told us things about him.
Is this massage also good for children?
Pain is a right, the mother's right, God is great, the size of the belly, the size of the child's hand.
Most of our children sleep like this.
When you pick him up, he likes to be carried. People think he likes to be carried, but he actually has gas in his stomach. God bless you.
As soon as the mother puts her heart into it, the father explains it so simply.
It is on the palm of the child's hand.
Hands interviews Icon The child is opposite it
Let’s see so that every mother can learn this move.
You press this button, then press left, right, left, right.
This is about the child, about the child, it’s so nice.
Okay, as for discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women.
It means, as we said, that in every house, ninety percent, mashallah, may God protect them, are women.
The first thing and the first warning is the ceramic and the even floor.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, our problem is that we always walk barefoot. It is possible, but only on a flat surface. This is dangerous.
Walk barefoot or evidence that the lack of ceramic flooring in homes has increased health problems.
Because the land is cold and flat.
When they were in Faresh Kan, they had problems and complained of asthma.
Increased more
The woman is keen to focus on walking barefoot on her heels.
This is the foot area, the heel area, which is the back of the heel.
From here, this foot is below the heel.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is on its way to facilitate childbirth.
Just focus a little.
In the seventh or ninth month
Just enter the month of birth in general
What I mean is that they won’t come on the 8th. The 8th is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is that she walks barefoot.
A pregnant woman should pay attention to walking barefoot.
If you enter during childbirth
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed. So shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, and it will drop fresh ripe dates upon you.
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, received her sustenance where she was.
See, I even discussed it with scholars, and they said, "Why change Ibn Kathir's interpretation?"
I said I am not going to give you the idea that God has put in this science and inspired me with it.
Shake the palm tree towards you. Of course, when she shook the palm tree, how did she come?
It’s sharp, like, as if you would say, like pins or nails.
When the palm tree shook, it gave orders to the wombs, which were the heaviest wombs in the middle here.
which are the viscera that gave us orders to facilitate childbirth and adjust the fetus.
The baby’s head is high, but it will adjust over time and become normal.
Glory be to God, this fruit has many benefits.
Hold hands, start and guide her.
Some people have made it a habit, while others know that it is actually a science.
They are afraid to tell you what they think of you.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz, your discoveries are very important, Mashallah.
I just wanted to know the last question, time flies, mashallah.
Someone wants to contact you. Anyone who wants to contact you has a specific email. Are you from
The phone is now available in the control room. Anyone who wants to contact Professor Abdulaziz can call us after the program.
Of course, the numbers of Qatar TV so that they can contact us and take this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe this, may God bless you in your work and may He bless the people.
Sin like people sin and do everything that a normal person would think of doing.
We just aspire to more goodness.
Always think positively.
I hope you enjoyed this segment as well, viewers, which was about reflexology and hand massage.
Also by foot
We saw a live example on air of how the person with us discovered what diseases he had.
And what does he suffer from? We hope you can provide us with information. And whoever wants to contact
How it will be implemented in the coming days and years, and whether it will include more schools.
Good morning.
How can this experience be possible?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The reality is that the problem of obesity in the Gulf countries has become a major problem.
We were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
And this program is, frankly, what happened when the First Lady came to New York.
She came to visit Doha and they had a program for that.
They offered it to us and we adopted it for ourselves, there is no problem.
It means our students with New York students, with students from Spain, with students from England.
So, even our students in Qatar, how is their level compared to the rest of the world? This is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage eating fruit among students.
He stopped playing sports.
Of course, it’s the fifth week and your family meal with the family.
Of course, that’s killing two birds with one stone.
Of course, in the sixth week, he will say what he has gained from this experience. Today, thank God, we are at the end.
So we are happy as students.
There were three independent schools for boys, Abu Obeida.
Independent Girls of Rokeya
Our morale is high.
It means that the family is aware, their siblings got excited at home and started eating this food like them.
It became a transitive relationship between students, and he even brought this culture home to his family.
He goes and tells them that I was raised like this, for example, or that I was taught like this.
The training staff who used to provide this information to students.
How did you choose him? How did you communicate with the students? Through whom?
Yes, we are, may God reward them with goodness, there are several parties that helped us.
And we have the brothers in [untranslatable] who taught them about Diet Center, taught them about healthy eating, you know.
Learn dining etiquette with sister A'isha Al-Tamimi
How do they organize themselves? How do they eat? How do they arrange things? What are the priorities?
To teach cooking, sports, or raise awareness about the benefits of healthy food.
It was neither in the form of separate lessons nor was it a curriculum.
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In a variety of ways, some of which were within the school.
At the beginning of the program, we had a day in Aspire Zone where we gathered all the students, both boys and girls.
Because this issue is not an issue that concerns a particular person, it concerns us all, because these are our children.
The students were shown how it worked at the beginning.
So you said that the results were satisfactory?
But are the three schools or certain classes in these schools enough?
Now, of course, this is the first experience in the world, when things first start, they don’t start on a large scale.
It starts on a reasonably good scale, where all the qualities are independent and specific to boys and girls.
because it doesn’t fit, for example, our culture, our environment, our family circumstances. Families, for ex
Fibonacci is actually what they originally mean to participate in, and it is really important.
A student at the age of twelve or thirteen is at the right age to learn about his health.
This means that many people suffer because they want to be weak, but they think it is impossible.
Some of the heroes we see in the cinema are like this, with weak bodies, and he says this is like something mythical.
We talked in detail, but unfortunately there were many weeks that we couldn’t cover.
We can also remind them of it through Doha Morning.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits or vegetables.
Humans know the benefits of fruits and know that if they eat them, their health will start to improve, which will give them morale.
In the fruit section, they would go to the supermarket and choose their fruit.
That's a point, for example.
It means diversification, of course. They competed, and each school excelled with its teachers and unique ideas.
The spirit of competition is the spirit of
We gave them the general picture and everyone can be creative.
It’s the teachers who used to train the students, you don’t have a special staff there.
We train them, we train them.
But, for example, some teachers, like Abu Obeida, said that Saturday would be a day for student activities.
For example, on those days off school, they decided to adopt Ruqayyah's school. They said it was worth the walk.
We’re going to have a healthy cooking day for girls. Okay, we didn’t force the boys to cook healthy food themselves, so the
Of course, thanks to Rayan Water, which provided all the water to the schools for free. Rayan Water did a great job in this matter.
So, of course, it means healthier water, because he will need to cleanse his body of all these toxic substances that enter his body daily through water.
This week we said the third.
So his body started to move.
He might play football or basketball, but he doesn’t know that this is the sport I love.
True, true, exactly, and some of them might want other games, some of them might not want a group game.
How live
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatari Association for Patients with Sclerosis, welcome.
And of course, we try as much as possible to focus on the most important topics.
We wanted to get to know and inform our beloved viewers about what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this name is also somewhat strange to us. Please.
The number of women infected is higher than the number of men.
All currently available treatments are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start to fight us.
We fought by hitting the nerve cell.
The easiest way to explain it to the public is that it is an electrical wire.
Covered with a layer called the softener to shake it off, it is a nylon layer.
Of course, it generally leads to imbalance, double vision, and blurred vision.
causes problems in the digestive and respiratory systems
It leads to madness, and in the worst cases, it leads to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, treatments
The most important functions in the human body that can be severely disrupted by it
He has a disease called sclerosis of the nerves.
Theories say that it is a viral transmission.
It is a non-contagious disease.
It is not transmitted to children.
Some people consider it a disease, depending on the region.
But the equator, for example, was completely spared from this disease.
We currently have cases on the equator that are infected with this disease.
This disease has no cure yet because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have not been able to find the cause of the disease in order to find a cure for it.
