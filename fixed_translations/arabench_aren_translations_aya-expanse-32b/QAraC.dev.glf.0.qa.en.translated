Wahoh is produced by the Modern Touches Arts Institution.
Sweet, strange, bold, action series
I am with Hamed.
To be honest, the series has a very nice story.
I'm with you, Hamed.
And what impressed me the most was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor.
And she wanted to put the pistol aside, so she threw it in the car.
You don't know that this is his son's car. He was surprised when the police searched it.
She picked her son up from school.
And he shot the cartoon with his rifle.
John gives it a strong kick, sending the carton flying through the window of the mother's room.
Here's the surprise.
Oh my goodness, this scene, this scene, and the cartoon dashed into the mother's room.

It's not reasonable to move like that at 85 degrees.
How could Abdulhamid do this to himself?

He asked me what I thought of the series. I told him that the series is popular throughout the Arab world.

He's been bothering me with all this nonsense about football, ruining my work.
Do you know if your son likes football?
"So, if he takes a few employees from the company to play with, what's the harm?"
You have four hundred employees in the company, so what are you going to do?
These ten are considered the core players.
And on top of that, he took four reserves and two administrators, but I don't know what he'll do with seventeen of them.
And the media spokesperson for the team
You're making a big deal out of these Muslims.
But I manage to get by until I develop, even though fans, meaning the audience, consider me the most important player on the field, the twelfth player.
Let him enjoy himself with them, so they can run ahead of him while he's happy.
And we are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now it's his turn, he said he wanted to play football first, I missed him.
May your voice be heard and your command obeyed.
He didn't do anything.
Now, because he brought in a few employees and started making them play in front of him, watching them and amusing himself with them, he became annoyed.
I told him not to hire employees.
Even if some of your colleagues need staff, don't lend them anyone.
Important bakers
Oh my God, guide you, why do you take important bakers after they fail?
The second time you hire employees, let me know.
No, no, this deal, let Hamdi review it with me.

Why did the team retreat? Why?
What's supposed to be happening now should make the coach of the International Bakery Center team think about making a substitution halfway through the game.

Which constitutes sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leads the global reserves with twenty-four percent.
Then Libya, the United States, and Nigeria.
3% for each of them, and the remaining countries of the world combined account for 15%.
And then
And also from production.
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the scramble for this region and its countries by the major industrial nations.
At the top of which is the United States of America, the world's largest consumer of oil energy.
However, oil prices are on a continuous upward trend.
And concurrent with a decline of the dollar to the US dollar.
The unit used for pricing oil.
Where the price of the barrel reached yesterday
This has led to an increase in the revenues of producing countries, and at the same time
To increase inflation therein.
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
In the prices of life and goods
That is in a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister.
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And for our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's numbers and phones.
The deputy's hours: Welcome.
I'd like to start with you from the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where can prices go?
Of course, where prices can go is a puzzling question.
Or what is called the market force.
Not OPEC.
And they are not producing countries.
And the producing countries, whether they are OPEC members or not, have nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is the relationship only between price and supply and demand?
And not now, even supply and demand have no significant impact.
What are the factors then?
In addition to supply and demand, there are other factors.
"What is
They felt immense pressures and turned to oil and gold, or what is known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold as well.
We have seen gold rise from three hundred and fifty dollars in recent years to reach nine hundred and seventy dollars now.
He still has, as mentioned, around a hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they decrease, it's only slightly.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year...
The second quarter is supposed to see a decrease in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing condition.
In the second quarter, at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100.
But that means the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in relation to winter and consumption have now changed, and there are other factors.
And economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to such an extent.
I spoke about political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
"Do you expect Iran's resignation in the face of political complexities?"
Its owners, and today it topped most of the headlines of American newspapers and the world press, can affect oil prices.
The input seems to be a mix
Today, we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Possible non-real factors can influence.
And they create a kind of disturbance in the market.
Also created a kind of political rumor.
He said there is no plan, but he also did not rule out other options that could also be pursued regarding Iran.
The stoat always interacts with the markets.
Of course, as of now, it's not confirmed that America is at war with Iran.
And I am among the people who do not see this scenario as meaningful.
Fallon will be, and there may be what we have not seen, what will it be in the future.
But it is we who work in the energy sector.
We see all these political tensions as
"The oil supplies in the
On the contrary, there are very comfortable supplies.
What indicates that there is oil going into storage?
There is never any shortage of oil supplies.
Preparation for the upcoming war, perhaps.
Under this reassuring picture you're painting about the supply and that there are no obstacles in the supply.
In case the American President Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan.
This is something else.
Prices are soaring to record highs.
The price of oil may reach
From the oil reserves in the world
You are here today, the Gulf represents the most important.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
They represent more than sixty percent of oil reserves today, which is certainly a significant figure.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates
That means that in the event of any war on Iran, it means that oil prices cannot be guaranteed to any extent they can reach.
Translation: "God knows, and perhaps it will arrive today. We arrived without it."
Wars for a hundred and seven dollars and a hundred and ten dollars, and it might jump to a hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under psychological and political tensions.
And the tensions that the speculators exploited.
Just an investor in oil.
This is what is called not investing, of course, real investment no, it's future purchasing or future marketing.
It is called oil paper.
And all of these are just paper oil fights.
All its production is approximately three hundred thousand barrels, more or less.
These might push for more purchases and thus more price increases.
I wish April was a joke.
I hope there isn't any.
Genie is coming to the region and it is said that this is on his main agenda.
Jili is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media professionals have said.
I didn't know what was in Jill's bag.
I cannot predict what it will mean.
Will he start a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens when we talk about April. April is very close, only a few weeks away, and we'll be entering it soon.
And the world may pay.
And America is a major consuming country.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't dial this number.
The production costs are cheap.
Comparison with West African countries, most of which rely on...
No other country in the world can match the Gulf.

When I asked a European official, I said, "It's strange that you speak among us in closed-door meetings."
In a way other than the one you speak in front of.
"Or the media said no, for political reasons."
And of course, there is what is called the "standard butt plug" or "double butt plug".
The meeting that everyone knows is the role of the Gulf countries. (Note: The original Arabic sentence has some grammatical issues, this translation assumes a corrected version of the sentence.)

Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our interest at the present time for the dollar to fall.
A weak or stagnant American economy is something the United States cannot afford.
So, what happened during this economic weakness and recession?
You too have become
The United States cuts interest rates on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the oil price is linked to the dollar.
The first one is over a hundred years old.
The first export of a barrel of oil was from the United States of America.
And it was issued in dollars.
And it has been since the beginning of the twentieth century until today.
Pricing the Dollar: Pricing Oil in Dollars
Historically, it became
For a hundred years, the whole world has been interacting and getting excited.
And which today considers Norway the third-largest oil-producing country.
And its source of oil
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
And the production of the North Sea oil in Europe.
Priced in dollars, not priced at.
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information pointing to something other than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
Is this talk true and there is nothing
And these agreements
It is based on oil remaining as the cover for the dollar, in exchange for the United States protecting these regimes.
This is not correct, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's not take the OPEC organization.
You have 62% of the deputy's support.
I am from thirteen countries.
"Out of the 85 barrels, 40% is the OPEC share."
There are many countries that are very large in oil production.
Outside the OPEC organization
What are the obstacles preventing pricing in another currency?
See, for the price, I can do another one.
Not all adults make decisions.
The translation of the provided text from Arabic to English is: "You are Saudi Arabia and the major Gulf states."
Today is the OPEC meeting.
There are sixty percent.
Even if, hypothetically, OPEC wanted to do that
There is an agreement among all oil-exporting countries to...
There is no intention or plan to change.
The translation

What is the effect of hesitation?
Let me talk about the Europeans now.
Why don't they export their oil?
I am from the North Sea or Russia and Norway in euros or rubles.
Because it is in their interest to have their currency expensive, high, and elevated.
On the contrary, no, on the contrary.
Here is where they have the loss.
One euro imports a barrel and a half.
No, you are the ones losing out because your currency has decreased in value since it is pegged to the dollar.
And it's a loss too, a huge loss.
The link between currencies here and the Gulf is historical.
You remember in the 1970s, the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.

Let's wait and not rush now. Let's see what happens today.
People started meaning...
Of course, in a complicit position.
The deputy's efforts mean that the inflation rate in Qatar reached 14% in 2007 and will increase to 15% in the coming year.
Eat people's salaries and devour people's salaries here. Here are the salaries of the workers here.
The salaries of people living in Qatar have eroded by 35 to 40 percent.
We'll be back after a short break to find out the extent of the increases that will be made in salaries.
The staff in Qatar will be at least in the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back, without borders, in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
And the Qatari industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the huge price increase.
Oil, which has brought tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing nations.
The original text is in Arabic, and here is the English translation: "The topic is oil, and my question is about the anticipated increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information."
The UAE has 89.7 billion in reserves and spends 2.6 out of 10.
Ton only and the report by Kuwait Times Economic report: Revenues of Gulf countries are among the largest.
Saudi Arabia's expected revenues for the year 2008 are $190 billion.
And it was
Last year, it was one hundred and seventy in the UAE. This year, it was expected to be fifty-seven.
Kuwait in sixty-four was fifty-four.
One-twenty-first of the oil is less than fifty-five billion.
As other reports say, it's a gas. God forbid I should be jealous; I'm not jealous, may the deputy be blessed.
Iraq has forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
The areas of spending were one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries imported goods worth one trillion dollars.
$1 was multiple imports.
Exploitation in the United States amounts to $1.3 trillion.
And nine out of ten billion.
"It was three in the afternoon in Bahrain."
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5 and it will increase to 7. In Qatar, it was 13.75 and it will rise to 14.80.
Those living in Qatar can expect further increases in the prices of goods, commodities, and the cost of living.
Life is being devoured and prices have risen at high rates and more in Qatar.
We feel all sympathy for everyone.
It must be our treatment.
And treatment is aimed at controlling inflation.
This means you will increase salaries by fifty percent.
They're not saying you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct and
The ministers were against raising salaries.
It seems there's a problem and the solution must be the optimal one.
And patching is not a solution.
Okay, is there a balance between the two sides?
The correct English translation
The important thing is to treat inflation.

The American trade deficit with China reached $82 billion.
The European Union has reached $86 billion with him.
This means that all global policy directions are working against the dollar.
And we are paying the price for this now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states.
It might end up in a confrontation with America.
Among the first advanced world countries such as China, Russia, and others, the issue may become...
Purely military
The explosion of China's bombs, Russia's bombs, Japan's bombs, and even American bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and this information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Welcome, your
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
So, what's your question?
What I see, however, is that the MP is determined not to cooperate.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And, God willing, he will descend to the lowest depth.

Thank you, Brother Mohamed. Thank you, thank you. Now, let's address the last comment from Ahmed Hassan in Qatar. Your question, Ahmed...
"الله يمسيك بالخير" translates to "May God greet you with goodness."
"Thank you, and you didn't fall short of the nice interview." Note: The phrase "ما قصر" is an Arabic idiom that roughly translates to "didn't fall short" or "didn't disappoint."
Translation: "A raise in salary, God willing, things will improve. We don't mean him specifically."
We are all facing problems, not just with salaries.
Salaries, God willing, things will be fine.

Here means we, some brothers, of course.
Those who don't know Qatar.
This is not correct for the State of Qatar.
The day someone comes to Qatar, they will see what the indicators are like. (Note: The original sentence contains some unclear or incorrectly spelled words, which I have tried to interpret as best as possible.)
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world

What is it in response to him?
When he spoke, the brother from Morocco spoke in a way that was not true or real.
The person who does not see with his own eyes.
If the person meant here comes and sees Qatar, what huge developments have taken place there.
In growing greatly, you do ask.
Everyone has the right.
And with such a small population, where will you find people to marry?
So, does that mean, for example, that you will import, for example, a surplus from China, for example?

Qatar's foreign policy appears vague to many observers.
Qatar enjoys distinct relations.
At the time when Qatar established relations with Israel, it was and still is...

Qatar presented.
For she began.
The largest Arab country.
What angered the regime in Egypt
With anger, he went as far as accusing her of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier who is a prisoner.
Qatar's foreign policy has extended its reach in ways that have angered the larger Arab states.
And what is the force that places you in this position?
From these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
They write to us via our website www.aljazeera.net.
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
On the 22nd of September, 2007, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It was a pivotal visit in the relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what's stuck.
This is what I mentioned.
The translation of "صحيفه
The agreement you reached with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through which you restored relations and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
Initially, your introduction was long and required many answers, apart from your last question.
"I thought she was pregnant."
Especially regarding the topic of Saudi Arabia.
What is flour?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important country for Qatar.
Located between the two countries.
I spoke about silencing the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
The dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined within a scope.
The translati
Praise be to God, and this is the judgment of the leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness Prince.
"In the Gulf, significantly." Note:
More than a hundred years.
The relationships were always bright, honorable, and based on trust.
I want to attribute it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This matter has been settled, and there were no conditions.
The correct translation of
But there was an understanding, and there was a sincere intention from both parties.
To resolve this pending issue
The relationship is not seasonal but strategic.
We wish for her not just longevity but evolution.
Beautiful diplomatic speech
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have avoided many problems.
I always said what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia, and therefore it is not diplomatic but faith.
The subject of Al Jazeera falls under the subject of media.
"Mediated between the two parties, and in many countries, intermediaries were brought in."
In her opinion, she can ignite or gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
"It's on Saudi Arabia's
We should resolve the dispute within the Gulf Cooperation Council.
That means the opposite of what was before.
A political compromise.
No, no, there was no agreement except for an agreement of love and an agreement of interest.
But if anything contradicts this subject, ask the Al Jazeera administration, "Have you built a strategy for promotion?"
Establish clear communication between you and Saudi Arabia to avoid what happened before.
The relationship was originally based on a close strategy.
Sure, here is the translation: "We can say it in one, two, three, four."
There must be solidarity.
And I settled some differences on this basis.
Between some Arab states and work to settle other disputes.
Now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are differences of opinion.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy, action, or issue, and another country has a different opinion.
This is a matter of perspective.
Some observers thought you took pleasure in criticizing Saudi Arabia.
By criticizing her.
Did you get tired and decide to change direction, then headed to a larger country, which is Egypt?
It means the same thing, the same idea.
No, we don't enjoy it and we're not free.
We will not deal with any other party in this manner.
This means that the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
Between them, and I know there is an understanding.
Translation: "It's too big, and
And there will be a kind of model.
The text you provided is in Arabic and translates to: "But Saudi Arabia, but but Saudi Arabia."
Let me put this under two lines for you.
You started to taunt Egypt in the newspaper Al-Ahram in the issue of April 10th last month.
The Official Gazette of Egypt
There is an ongoing comprehensive investigation, she said, expanding on the inquiries.
In the Hezbollah network, a disruptive plot was revealed.
Egypt targets a participation of three countries, namely Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
And Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media outlet known for its conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest of the Arab states.
Conspiring against Egypt.
We respect.
And a struggle over the years
I'm not saying it to manipulate anyone's emotions.
I won't complete what you didn't complete.
We can do it.
And the Egyptian president
The Arabic
On Arab relations.
First point
The topic of Gaza.
As they say and as we acknowledge.
Qatar is a state.
Its size is small.
You can participate in a scheme of this kind.
Because we have suffered from the interventions of countries at one point, and I don't want to go back to that.
Who sold the interventions of some countries in Qatari affairs?
And therefore, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they have discovered what they call a conspiracy.
And also, mentioning names means that we, I want to say, the house has a Lord who protects it. Syria and Iran defend themselves. I won't defend them.
Settling in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter like this?
The pyramids do not speak out of whimsy.
The Qatari state sought to undermine Egypt's role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
We organized a parallel conference to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a biased media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Oh, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable, Miss.
I can tell you confidently.
"An aḥnā" Translation: "If we"
It's not our policy to interfere in such circumstances.
What forced our brothers in Egypt, and this is what we hold the Egyptian officials accountable for.
The disagreement or sensitivity among some members of the Egyptian government.
But some officials are sensitive.
"من اي
I'm coming to you about the matter.
The days of peace, the cause of peace, and us.
And before it, one was held in Egypt.
And then it was held at our place.
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You don't have a dispute with Israel.
And now, because the conference has started since that day.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they have a sensitivity.
Why this sensitivity?
You sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
And we always hope for the best.
We discovered this sensitivity.
"او او ثلاثه يعني" translates to "It means two or three." in English.
The Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt does not want to reconcile with Qatar.
The text
In Qatar, and I am at the top in Kuwait, we told them, "Guys..."
The Palestinian people have been subjected
More than two weeks
But we organize it before the scheduled Kuwait Conference, which we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and ...
"و ب وب يعني بتسويف" translates to "And by web, I mean procrastination."
The dispute began.
Not even a small nation has stopped this fighting.
Of course, I know that some of the brothers are in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else but Egypt.
When they said that after...
Okay, you're on the island.
And the Israelis have been informed that before that day, there will be a meeting to stop the fighting before any speech by anyone or anything else.
What is
Oh brother, they brought in medicine and food during the beating that our brothers were receiving.
Sometimes they say the gate is narrow.
What brought the trucks in?
They once told us that there was an agreement on the other side and they had to come.
Now is not the time for us to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; what mattered to us were the one and a half million people who were being hit.
And they have no medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and speaking at the Gaza conference
And when Qatar gets involved in the matter, it causes sensitivity for the regime in Egypt.
It's not interference.
We didn't discuss how Egypt is handling the situation because that's Egypt's responsibility.
One of the officials said they discovered a big conspiracy behind the matter.
He still hasn't told us what the conspiracy is.
"We mean this official."
He tells us that Egypt is a great thing.
Okay, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say 'great Egypt'.
And that's why we always ask a lot from the major countries.
Because Egypt is ours.
And you were also invited to a conference where there was provocation for them.
We were invited to a conference.
Ages of Gaza
And we coordinated, and our position was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden means I know Turkey brought things through Israel.
I would be happy to see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
One of us, from within us.
And if Egypt prevails or does something politically good.
This is what we believe is in our interest in Qatar and the interest of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If she does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish what I was saying. Your question and introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The issue that you are now wasting my time with...
No, I tell you, I tell you, I mean now, in anger.
It is because of the anger of the officials in the Egyptian system towards you that...
We are the ones who failed the Doha Summit.
The second thing is that they failed the Doha Conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom that he desired.
He wants to make peace.
And therefore, some countries ban certain things.
And this is something I told our brother in Saudi Arabia because we...
We have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
The reason for the sharpness is that it appears in internal shapes.
"Is there anyone among the officials?"
The higher-ranking officials have it.
A large country has one leader who can do the work of a small country full of workers.
That means it was meant for you.
She can play any role.
Darfur is part of Egypt's national security and Sudan.
Read the five major countries and
If it were any other country besides Qatar, it would be possible.
Sensitivities like these only lead to an increase in the problem. Why do you stick your nose into everything that's none of your business?
To get rid of an allergy, we take antihistamines. They tell us what the allergy is.
Why the sensitivity?
Some brothers in the government.
They have an internal failure.
They want to divert attention from the real conspiracy in Gaza, a coup.
That means, as the English say, "Apple the Italian."
"All that glitters is
Recipient of not only instructions but also analyses
I understand what happened, so it's okay.
The issue must be addressed locally.
The text
By God, my priority is my country.
My priority is to act first by looking at the issues that concern my country.
And then see if I have enough time.
Consider matters of concern to the Arab community.
And otherwise, Qatar tried to mediate.
And think about every Arab issue in which you can contribute by contributing as much as you can.
Why are you being provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can't treat you.
I can explain my opinion.
Don't throw it at me.
The translation of "و احنا احنا
"What sprang from his heart."
Let me finish for you.
When the peace initiative was announced and the leaders gathered in Kuwait, we were filled with hope. I issued a statement welcoming this development.
In dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who boasted of his heroism.
In his article, I think it was a TV interview or something, I'm not going to respond to her.
Because I have a response to every point.
But I, in order to preserve the minimum relations that bind us and the Arab interests.
Also in response to the call mentioned by the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques.
But all I'm advising is this and nothing else.
And they try to correct their mistakes, internally or externally.
In politics, economics, or other fields, just as we have mistakes in our political and economic policies, no one is infallible.
They are accusing Qatar of these accusations.
You deny Qatar's involvement in anything related to the Hezbollah cell.
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations and undermine its role and contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
We are few in number.
If we are able to play this role
This is incorrect.
There are accusations against you personally.
Paying money to the captors of Shalit so that Qatar can take Shalit and outbid the Egyptian role in the matter.
He always accuses us of asking for money first. We didn't pay any money, and we didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this issue
We support Egypt's efforts to resolve the issue between the Palestinians, just as we have always supported Egypt and continue to do so.
I propose that the Palestinian president remain in office until this issue is resolved.
We were present and the first to support the State of Qatar.
"The Palestinian Authority and its institutions shall remain in place until the dispute is resolved."
The phrase
In the Arab League, he says no, we have not passed it because we believe there are people who do not want this subject.
But we got through it cleverly.
Does that mean he addresses his boss?
His Prime Minister
Brother, I don't know if there's a problem.
Translation: "From us, from them, I don't know."
They decided now, in the last April issue, that the newspaper Al-Shuruq broke the news.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news satellite channel to confront the media mouthpiece called Al Jazeera and put an end to it.
For soon the days will pass, matters will be resolved and settled.
But you fear that the island will become a thing of the past.
This translates to: "Now means
As you conceded to Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not concede, nor did they concede to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small country yielding to the large country Egypt.
No, Saudi Arabia. There's an important point I'd like to clarify.
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia are different.
So, let's talk later.
So, what about Qatar's relations with Egypt?
We pin a lot of hopes on it.
Let me be frank with you, is this solitude?
I disagree with the main policy.
"Because we don't have a personal dispute, I told you that we respect the Egyptian people."
If I asked you now to name two problems, Gaza a

Minister of Foreign Affairs
The presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal.
We talked about everything.
But it was clear that the situation had worsened and was not resolved.
No, no, there was, there was, no, look.
That means I can't tell you about our relations with Egypt.
They have a right to be upset, and it's our duty as brothers to address it.
And we have a legitimate grievance against them as younger brothers.
In the major countries, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other major country.
This means "Egypt is bigger
It's not a matter of life and death that I'm referring to, but rather that the solution should come from heaven.
For us, if someone is waiting for satisfaction...
Someone is waiting for a style.
Qatar has
Treat him not as an equal or a brother.
As a major country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major country.
But if someone deceives someone else...
This means I know that Israel is following us.
And although both Obama and the previous American policy in the previous administration were with me or against me.
I believe they don't want to imitate either Israel or America on this matter.
And then they mean that if their sons are also involved, their policies are also under pressure from external parties.
In several matters, let me finish for you.
We understand and know that even the greatest nations can make mistakes and face challenges.
The suit drives your politics.
We don't have any moves. Our move is one.
The internal affairs of Qatar are our internal matter.
And in any field where we can help in the Arab world, we assist in it.
What are the sources of power for Al Jazeera Channel and Al Udeid Base?
You could say this isn't strong.

Let me finish for you, don't worry, we don't want to bother anyone.
And I don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say what they want, whether it's about Greater Qatar or anything else.
But we have a point of view.
We expelled the Israeli ambassador and closed their embassy.
Glory to God, first they said close the office, so we closed the office. They got angry and went to tell the Americans, "Look at these people."
They joined what they call the Devil's team.

And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to inform him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the staff
He needs to leave.

And focusing on Egyptian and Arab interests.
Is there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a major power.

The world still has a long way to go.
That means "We don't get angry in the Egyptian way that you have."
If someone extends their hand to us, we'll extend our arm a meter.
Now His Excellency Sheikh
That means we've never gotten used to running.
Except on a sound basis, we are ready to run to Egypt.
Stand with Egypt.
There are many rumors now about Egyptian workers in Qatar being affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs, whether in collections or major positions.
Are you aware of this matter or not? It is not in Qatar's nature to cancel jobs and positions.
Because these people have nothing to do with what's happening.
This is a market with fluctuating demand; one cancels, another comes.
He is bold and demanding, and in other nationalities, they are more discreet in their increased numbers.
Okay, a quick answer.
The office existed.
We've disturbed the office, so we should leave now.
We used to joke that all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
We've closed it. Let them solve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And they were among them, and it's our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to honor Gabriela Mistral.
By God, we didn't honor her before when the relationship was as they say "good." Honoring her now is a bit difficult.
There is no reason now to reopen the office during this period.
The office opens when there are no reasons.
It's you who raised him.
"The size of Egypt"
It was Egypt that imposed this.
Our relationship with America is strategic. Let me be clear with you.
In some matters, this is...
What are the most important things?
On some issues regarding our region's treatment, we had differences with the previous administration.
Now we really have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe that there is a great hope that this administration
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "A road in the heart of moving the path of peace. A road in solving the Palestinian issue."
All our friends, and that's what we deny.
What is happening in Iran, what is its impact on the Gulf and on you?
This is a matter for the Iranians to decide how to resolve their issues.
Among them
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they will overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability, as mentioned by His Highness the Amir.
It is important for our region, the Gulf, and we share common borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because we are a country that seeks peace and stability for this region.
And we intervened whenever anyone on either side wanted to change or modify the Doha Agreement.
I didn't think Saad Hariri said that.
Now it's over, only the strategic talk remains between the president.
And among the Lebanese groups
The translation of
Regarding Yemen, do you have a role to play, or have the Yemenis taken a stance against you?
First, we are known for supporting unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are an Arab state, unique and Gulf, that stood with the Yemeni unity.
Regarding the south, we have spoken with Yemen, and I was sent by His Highness the Amir twice to meet with His Excellency the Yemeni President.
I clarified to him that our goal is to stabilize Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
Neither party respected this agreement, and I don't want to say what each did.
But what really bothered me was...
That Qatar, which has taken this stance, is being accused of paying money to the Houthis, and this is being alleged by high-ranking officials.
"We Yemenis, because we do not interfere in these affairs."
Those who stand with unity do not stand against it.
And for another purpose in the interest of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
This is a topic we don't object to, but frankly, I was shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness the Prince sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this accusation is strange.
Time is up, but briefly, will these problems that you have faced in your efforts to solve issues change your policy of intervening in other Arab problems?
By God, if His Highness the Amir were to listen to my advice, I truly believe there is no need for that.
And he offered us a large amount of money once.
More than five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion. Better than the headache.
I just say it and I believe it, because maybe the time in the Arab world now means...
What is allowed under these circumstances?
"Thank you very much, Your Excellency Sheikh."
And perhaps even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's state.
The agreement reached in Doha
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Upon the committee's authorization and with full support.
On the subject of Lebanon, after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
There was an Arab consensus.
And if we went to New York, we could make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we noticed in Doha that both parties were keen.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or be there.
Since we knew the committee, we knew.
Face reality and find out what the problem is after we spent long hours with the Lebanese.
And I believe it is a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere in the region directly affects it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon is blessed with this location.
The translation of "ان
Unfortunately
External reverberations
So I can say the problem between the Lebanese, even if there is a problem, it is not the number one problem.
Well, Sheikh, I know perhaps it's not too early now to talk about the behind-the-scenes stuff, but
So what happened? You came here.
You could say that you stopped the fight on the ground.
"You didn't delay a single moment."
What exactly was happening, I know very well, even the Lebanese leaders at that time were telling me what happened.
No, I was from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him, "If we go to Lebanon..."
By proposing this idea, His Highness the Amir endorsed and supported it.
All Lebanese leaders will be present.
Since you're here in Beirut, I'll show you around my neighborhood.
And you are staying in the same hotel and in the same place.
And on the same plane, you met and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but it was in our minds from the beginning.
And this was the most important decision of all.
Of course, it was in there.
And this is what I have touched upon from the Arab League.
We will be fair mediators.
And I believe, praise be to God, that this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides.
To reach a respectable solution for both parties.
And that there is no single loser.
Before you take your next step
The consultation took place at the Arab League, and we found support.
What we've done.
"And I told him while we were there."
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha.
And he had advised me to
Lock them in, take away their phones, and remove any distractions.
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria were also supportive of the position.
And I told you from the beginning, without Arab support, the committee would not have been able to accomplish anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
In several issues surrounding the Arab world.
And every time we put out a fire.
It is in the interest of the Arab world to distance itself from foreign interventions.
And I will try as much as possible to be in.
Sends forces
Even militarily
In this, I believe the subject is...
In the state of Sheikh.
He always used to say, "Solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file."
Saudi-Syrian Accord
"B qaf qaf, if correct, or qaf arab means Qatar and the Arab League."
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to review ourselves.
Since Arab disagreements
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And this we have tried.
In the war of seventy-three.
When Arabs agree on a solution to a matter
I believe this is a benefit.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
The two parties
"They overcome wisdom."
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because in the Arab world, we face immense and great challenges.
Everyone plays in our courtyard.
And we have no power or strength.
And how do we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
As Arabs, we should at least have a minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
We are spectators.
Our lack of agreement as Arabs and the lack of trust between us Arabs; trust is lost between Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries.
It's not so much treason as it is a kind of...
The sentence "الجلسي ايش
This is an issue that requires a stand from everyone, I mean, I believe.
Well, will you materialize this wish? Will you really call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
I mean, it came up in the conversation.
Could you play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even indirectly?
It means they are eager to find solutions, and I am sure that with their wisdom...
They might reach an understanding.
They differ on many issues.
I was in harmony with the policy, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relationships are improving.
Both parties need to want to take a step forward.
But I can't definitively say that this is what's happening now.
I am sure that if the Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned, ...
A state of optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I cannot connect what happened in Lebanon.
"Can be translated on the ground as meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation."
There is an escalation, perhaps American-Iranian, perhaps other issues, you know.
Will you still fear her in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can only order food and medicine delivery.
And electricity for the people.
In Qatar, we are always ready, Your Highness, the Emir.
More than 150 million Palestinians are besieged.
We do not want them to have weapons, and we do not want them to have victory, nor do we want...
They do all this.
The provided
And we will give it, God willing, to the Red Cross organization to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we managed to send them food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them continues.
And I appeal to the Palestinians on both sides to place national interest above all else.
And they leave illusions.
This Palestinian rift now means a deep wound.
The translation
And they did not and did not abide.
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
And they must request that even if they go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And they will resolve this disagreement.
They will not benefit.
Why promises from any side?
I wish there were a solution, but...
Our position on this matter is known, and we have conveyed it to all concerned parties.
We will not be a party and will not accept being a party to any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but these interests will not harm them or us.
We believe that the Gulf's destiny is to have a clear agreement among the Cooperation Council countries.
And Iran is committed to cooperation and peaceful coexistence.
But when Sheikh Tamim says that Qatar is not a party to it.
Is there any detail or clarification?
Just a hint.
No, never.
Alright, I'd like to go back, if permitted, to the Lebanese file.
To be perfectly honest, we were facing a major deadlock in the Sheikh's country, but in the last few hours, we managed to find a solution.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
Perhaps this is information that may be scattered and unrelated, but what happened?
Until you reached this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul, I know it was scheduled for specific dates in advance.
Oh, if you had known about the negotiations.
Continuously on the topic of the solution in
There is no doubt that the support of the Kingdom is very important.
Change the tactics of the negotiations.
The negotiations led to...
We have reached a positive outcome by bringing together various parties from different directions.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari orientation in this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about one substance after another.
"In the last moment, we overcame an obstacle
But the prince passed by the outskirts.
And remove this obstacle.
And he was free from it.
We heard the word "Emir of Qatar" in the opening session in Doha.
Doesn't that mean your role now is...
See, the most important thing is to keep this matter away from the spotlight.
We have no regional ambitions.
By God, we will have control over a state or something, because we are a state.
We are proud of ourselves. Yes, we believe that we can contribute to solving issues with our fellow brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
The translation of "ان
We want her to do something, and it's very important.
Some small countries believe they can play this role and are supported in doing so.
Some things are excellent, some are good, and some are less than good.

Is it a political priority?

Circumstances require us to do a lot.
Qatar has not given up on the Arab summit.
We actually went with the idea of the Arab summit before.
Unity is not only through UN Security Council resolutions but also through...
Don't always be trodden on and underestimated.
And let me put it in another sentence.
"And we discipline."
The Arab street can no longer bear it, if the officials responsible for the Arab street cannot bear it.

When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some people spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold the meeting.
"We should make it as difficult as possible as long as there is no Arab consensus."
And I don't blame those who think that not having a meeting might be a good thing.
He solved the problem somehow.
The translation of "لان

Because our goal is not propaganda or advertising; our goal is to find.
That means you didn't give up on the summit.

Previous and subsequent, the Security Council resolution, but let's just stick to the topic of the Arab Summit. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
"Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever is present."
We found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit.
Who did you block?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
That means we are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, that's all. If we go to any nations in Asia, in Latin America, or elsewhere.
And without a solution.
Countries classified as moderate.
And what is moderation in our view?
Are we abandoning the Palestinian cause?
Because we like them.
Are we interfering in the Palestinian affair in a certain way?
That means no mother allows the intrusion of who is good and who is bad.
What Hamas and Hezbollah are today, I don't know what other parties they'll become tomorrow.
Is she a student?
And can we be a part of the Arab body?
It was planned for us to engage in internal Arab fighting.
Okay, and if we go to the Security Council?
There is no Security Council resolution.
I hope that after Israel completes its mission...

There is no longer a peace issue.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because one side is telling you, "No, we need to wait."
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative.
And the peace talks with Israel froze.
We say that we are on one side, saying that we are losing on this subject.
In a greater loss than the one we're experiencing now. Well, we've always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the ceasefire.
Saeed Al-Sheikh says that arguments are not important.
There were those who wished they could put an end to Hamas and the like.
This is more an expression of a political stance than a confrontation between a minister and another minister, and so on.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that occurred.
But not everyone.
We don't want to speak on behalf of others.
It is very important that we are men ourselves, men of our nations.
We implement our nations' policies.
Who does things like this on her behalf?
"اعتقد يعني
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, are there those who play roles on behalf of the West?
No, God willing, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
Following the Security Council resolution
What will his agenda be?
The situation seemed decisive in the Arab effort.
And here is the disagreement if Israel implemented the decision immediately.
We can say that we made a decision.
But Israel did not implement this decision.
Now are we ready to go and request Chapter Seven? I know there are difficulties, of course.

The current Arab situation
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council
And they agree on a summit and make difficult decisions.
And the Western countries will seek us out.
Because we are in the Arab world, in a global context, and among people, and you see how the Arab street is moving on this issue.
But this decision is important.
It's a matter of calling our chiefs one after the other.
Translation: "So, in the end, they said, 'By God, it
Okay, if we were like Germany or other countries now, would we demand?
Those who carried out the attack don't have to pay compensation if you act on incorrect information.

It's assumed that we, who are left, are not bound by the decision.

Even if, after the Israeli rejection, Israel eventually accepted.

Will you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't believe in the Arab nation.
In the current situation, it is ready for any alternative.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For other political purposes
"To favor one group over another in Palestine, instead of reconciling them, only creates more division among the Palestinians."
We started trying to plan.
Once they held a conference, I don't know, some kind of Arab-European intelligence gathering, without mentioning names.
And once they did, it means we're sitting and sharing.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
Either we go or...
This means I want there to be a distinction.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The consequences are because this issue started two years ago, the Gaza issue, not now.
I will talk about the subject two years ago, but specificall
Do you have any reservations about its clauses?
"What has been issued and what has been implemented."
We weren't invited.
Perhaps they think we have a different viewpoint.
It was required that everyone be of one mind.
It's not necessary for us all to agree, but I believe those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for it.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza for two years, you said that parties...
Prevailing a category over another that participated in the topic of the siege on Gaza.
Indeed, you agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there.
On genuine Arab complicity in everything that is happening now in Gaza.
That means we're aware of a part of it.
Let me tell you about the subject, we're not privy to everything.
But I know.
The Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
I am an Arab and international person.
And if it had not been for the fact that they differed, they would have been destroyed.
And it was after the elections that took place.
The atmosphere of authority.

We should give them a chance and see.
They either want to reform or they are still revolutionaries in the sense of revolution, meaning they only know the gun and fighting.
But on the day they came
In Arabic, some of our brothers believe that these radical movements should not come to power.
Now some are saying there was an assault.
In the past, Hamas, or the Palestinians from Gaza, have broken the ceasefire.
The Arab
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain hungry for two years.
The phrase
For Israeli security reasons
Clear, okay, I don't want them in power. This doesn't concern me, I'm in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the remaining people?
"So what, and then who decides?"
"These or that - not all states have the sovereignty to choose."
The translation
He is the root of the problem.
But I'm sure it could have been treated.
If we testify, we testify that we disagree.
But it's clear that we were required to defeat one category after another because of this category.
Category: We consider them terrorists or those we consider to be terrorists.
What happened was all these led to...
And also, even the promises they made to ensure the other party would live comfortably.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian initiative, which
Egyptian in Cairo
Those Egyptian efforts
Certainly, here is the translation: "Absolutely, it is not a wrap."
She is required to play an important role.
And Egypt also has borders adjacent to Israel and Palestinian borders.
"An aḥna" Translation: "If we"
And now we must stop the chaos.
In Gaza, we need people to stop the chaos in Gaza because...
This is not the way to peace.
There must be one.
And that's why we always ask her for a bigger role.
What was announced by her.
This means that the initiative cannot be evaluated now.
Either you give the possibility of success or of studying.
I believe in our chances of success.
If the Brotherhood in Egypt can...
They are bringing together Palestinian viewpoints.
And those discussing the initiative should assume the affected party in Gaza.
Because he who touches it might say yes, and he might say no.
And this is an important point.
When the decision was issued in 1860.
We have a Palestinian Arabic problem.
"We don't want to hear a word."
But I wish that when the Palestinian delegation left, ...
And when they went to the university, they asked for someone to be with them from Gaza.
Even now, they are showing the Israelis that these are our brothers, we are one with them.
This is an important point.
We don't make salad.
Our goal is to protect and serve, and we build our policy accordingly.
The phrase "على البقاء

Every day passes.
Our brothers' blood is being shed.
What we don't want is for either us or the Israelis to stretch this issue until they finish their mission, and then we start raising this initiative.
And I am sure that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt know this and are keen on it.
And this is what I want to clarify: I'm just saying what I think.
It's necessary to solve the problem now.
And it's not as Israel wants.
Noting this Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis
So, is it an expression?
"عن فراغ عربي" translates to "On Arab Vacuum" in English.
And there was no doubt that his position was striking.
And it has an Arabic depth.
Her entrance is in an Arab deficit.
We know there is an Arab deficit.
Partly because of the disagreements.
Partly because each person thinks their own perspective is the best.
And so-and-so believes that his viewpoint is the best.
And there is no consensus on how we can make people respect us and recognize the Arab decision.
"And they do not separate from us, one by one."
One person says, "No, no problem. Let's give them an extra two or three days so that I can teach them a lesson and bring the group to their senses. Then the issue will be resolved."
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have made mistakes, but we should not hold them accountable.
The text
But now
At least say "no."
In the context of the situation, Qatar is also required to comply. As we hear, we will return to this point.
In the field as well, at the same time, you heard.
Khaled Meshaal, yesterday, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas Movement
First, it's not necessary to repeat everything that Brother Khaled Meshaal says, with all due respect and appreciation to him.
Why don't we sit with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
Bring him to the Arab League and tell him.
This is important talk.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing Israel's conditions also imposes conditions.
Let them also impose conditions, it is forbidden for them to impose conditions and for Israel to impose conditions.
First, what is your opinion about this Arab popular gift?
Whether they are riff-raff or just a crowd, we don't have to listen to them. Once they told me to be quiet, but I didn't listen.
De Gaulle, first of all, liberated his own country.
With allies and without, he liberated his country from Nazi occupation.
Now we're talking.
The Arabic gift is something we are supposed to have.
Presidents are supposed to represent the views of their people.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations that we have witnessed.
It can be fulfilled from these demand rows.
Also, many of those criticising Qatar in this situation are demanding...
In light of what is happening, the office and the representation remain open.
They're speaking the same language.
By cutting ties, we stand with all Arab nations.
To cut off all relations, even if someone claims to have a treaty.
They want Qatar to sacrifice.
"An aḥna" Translation: "If we"
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but also in harder decisions.
I am making this
This means we must have a unified Arab stance.
The translation
No one will sell anything to anyone else if they expect to gain moral or material benefits from it, or if they are called upon to do so.
Yes, before we close this file, on this subject as well, there are countries that have taken individual steps.
Good Chavez's subjects differ. Chavez has a dispute with America.
What do our peoples need us to summon?
The five permanent member states and the arguments are presented. These are movies.
We're done with that street, now it's smarter.
"With the highest happiness,
He calls on the resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter were framed within a single Arab framework, it could succeed?
But let's call for an Arab stance that will earn us respect from others.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor are we motivated."
How can we bring Syria, bring Lebanon, and bring the other countries, when there are Arab countries that don't even speak to each other?
There needs to be
A qualitative shift in Arab relations.
This is the policy that now prevails among Arab states.
"I'm on the list, but I think my eligibility has expired."

The situation in Gaza is different. The situation in Gaza is still...
Trapped from all sides.
And this siege
It gives a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals for Israel, that is, the objectives of the operation for Israel.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "A day you strike someone, a day you punish them, a day like this, a day you please them."
And therefore, the example of what happened in Lebanon, for them, is not a good example.
The solution model that occurred in Lebanon
You consider him righteous.
To Gaza
See the problem in Gaza or, or, the Palestinians; their solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
"Are we going to reclaim our land today or tomorrow?"
My disputes are about power.
On the distribution of power.
This differs because their tissue is closer to each other.
I am part of the intellectual fabric of Lebanon.
And therefore, the solution is simpler.
And here is the problem.

That means we only have a few minutes left. If we summarize this topic, where can we go from here?

"Ka min nāḥiyah istirātijiyyah" translates to "From a strategic point of view."
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we haven't seen a comprehensive initiative.
"Neither in the past nor now, why?"
The issue is not about initiative as much as we are feeling it.
Those who solve the issue, we help without mentioning Qatar's name because some people might be sensitive to it.
Our goal is not to hold a summit, as we already have one scheduled for March.
If we take the initiative, will we be better than our brothers? I don't think so.
"And we don't pressure them."
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
So, in this initiative, we met with all parties. There was a meeting scheduled for the fourth, but it was postponed due to the trip to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress. We ask our Arab brothers to help us as much as possible in this matter.
We hope to keep him away from the topic of competition.

And of course, we always attend any summit of any Arab sibling.
And we always refrain from attending any summit.
But isn't he afraid that it will turn into a political summit?
Of course, considering time imposes itself.
It's too late, even if it means after ten days.
We are talking about Palestinians after they have spent twenty-five days enduring beatings.

It is said that the Arabs were unable to unite.
This is what we said.
This is what we said.
With respect, this summit is already scheduled, and we are committed to it.

I have also served as a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have also presented more than seventy-five lectures, working papers, presentations, and published articles in Arab and international journals.
First, let's agree on the term currently in use.
When referring to people with disabilities, the term "people with special needs" is often used, but as you mentioned, "people with disabilities" is also appropriate and commonly used. Both terms aim to describe individuals who may require additional support or accommodations due to physical, mental, or cognitive differences.
The first part of your

Then the concept shifted towards another concept.
The fields of special education and special pedagogy emerged...
This category became
And so we started calling them "people with special needs."
The normative rules from which it is derived.

Then the steps accelerated until the international convention appeared, which was legally binding and distinguished from the rules in this regard.
And I set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
He treats these people as humans, as people, as individuals.
With the change in terminology, as you mentioned, is there a change in the perception of this category of people in society?
Yes, and it is measured in...
Varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this subject is...
The Arab world has distinguished itself or differed.
However, the human rights approach exists in their culture; human rights are present, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are perhaps due to a lack of financial resources, isn't it?
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: culture does exist, but there is sometimes a lack of resources and even a lack of political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low, and there is also no legal culture.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.
And they are suffering from unemployment.

In remote areas, people with disabilities are often isolated in far-flung regions.
Therefore, there are many trends of organizations working in this field that are trying to raise...
Awareness is the realization of the right to education.
Instead of establishing many religious centers, if I may say so.
It is noted that they establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things that, praise be to God, we have been able to achieve through our work in the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the State of Qatar.
The translation
You organize the work agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of people with disabilities in the world
I cannot call it or agree with you that there is a decline.
If there is a decline in the Arab region, it is in the area of disability issues.
Within the social context, within the political context, and within the economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to...
And they are among the marginalized groups.

First, is intellectual disability included in the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual disability means a person who was healthy but due to some pressure became a pressure factor and was exposed to an intellectual disability.
He became intellectually disabled due to the torture and imprisonment he endured. He has been receiving treatment for six years now.
I know around four hundred people, ranging from children to mentally disabled adults, who are affected by imprisonment.
Is there a law in the United Nations?

I return to our guest to comment on what was mentioned.
Suleiman wondered if there was a mental impairment.
Yes, within the classification.
Translation: "The global disability certainly includes intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called." Note: The original text is in Arabic and the translation maintains the same formatting and structure.
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or hearing impairments, and motor disabilities.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
Action and reaction occur within a specific social context.

Her disability imposes some limitations or restrictions on her.
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
And this is one of the fundamental points in the world of disability that is often overlooked.
The United Nations, unfortunately, delayed it somewhat during preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll end with this.
The world consists of governments and non-governmental organizations, the member states of the United Nations.
We sent another questionnaire.
United Nations organizations and agencies in the various regions
In order to know to what extent disability programs are on their agendas.
If budgets are allocated, then there is involvement of people with disabilities.

In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand it.
Establish an International Disability Support Fund and allocate one percent of the net profit of every institution in the world.
This is mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
Many disabled people, war victims, and the like will struggle and suffer.
"Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah, for telling us from Saudi Arabia."
Naji Machri wonders and reviews his problem: he is a person with a disability.
At the local or national level, meaning through Algeria.
Community needs must be met within the community itself.
These are the same rights that should accrue to any other person.
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
That is why I am really calling from here, from this platform, governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of this citizen and this individual.
In order to ensure
Those needs and rights are already on the existing agendas.
No, there is no need, I mean, to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or no need if it is this state.
She can and indeed must be committed to performing it.
So I advise him first to return and refer to the responsible authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because that falls within the national scope and must be done within this scope.
Your mention of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities — many countries have signed but do not comply.
And here we have a caller's question: "Why are there no laws?"
It's a definite truth that we live in a human society, which entails a lot of mistakes and a lot of correctness.
Certainly, there are many agreements and certainly, in many treaties, there is no literal commitment.
Many countries have made an ideal commitment to join many conventions such as CEDAW and others. Note: CEDAW stands for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. I assumed that "سيداو" in the original text referred to this convention.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know that.
But the issue is that we adopt an agreement and accede to it.
First, we will at least ensure that there is awareness.
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers.
And the officials, then it escalates until it reaches the society as a whole.
The issue is also our commitment to prepare reports, and these reports reach the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and increased levels of consciousness.
For the reports, did you work as a rapporteur at the United Nations?
Yes, from what I saw and what I recorded, there is interest.
Therefore, I believe that there is a relative advantage for the Arab region in acceding to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
So I advise, encourage, and advocate.
It also means that it is important for people with disabilities...

Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
I am from Qatar.
In actuality, Sheikhah Hessa had a long history as the chairwoman of the board.
The international convention you are speaking about now is, in fact, a reality.
It is a great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially in the Arab world.
"And I, like a deaf person, wish."
For these countries to implement this international agreement.

The International Fund for Supporting Disabilities
Disability, and it should be mandatory for all countries to provide funds. What is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Monitoring is crucial for implementing normative rules.
During those six years of work, there was very little support.
Except for China and Austria
"And it is always that I thank this country for this support." A more natural phrasing could be: "I always want to thank this country for its support."
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
"Who established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God."
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
This means, as we mentioned at the beginning, and this point is always raised that
"With ordinary people's
And how do we care for people with disabilities or care for the disabled?
This means that there is a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.

As part of the budget allocated by him.
This lack of commitment you spoke about in paying financial dues and

Even developed countries do not provide.

Doctor, hello Sheikhah Hessa.
Almost ten years.
This girl, we now notice, has a psychological disability.
So what is your role in helping a girl like her who is suffering?
She is with her colleagues.
That means sometimes even if we stay.
So what is your role, in other words, with respect to Qatari girl children?
"Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Marri, for talking to us from Qatar, and Kروانan Behijat from Kuwait. Welcome!"
As they say, O Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we mind our own business?
It is possible to count the number of Arab people with special needs.
And we can help them.
We have immense financial resources.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale.
And seek her for this noble purpose.
This is if we are truly believers.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for her efforts and contributions during her tenure as the Special Rapporteur.

I believe this is a large percentage.

In the past, there was...

Yes, Korwan Behjat wondered and suggested that one percent of the budgets of Arab countries be allocated.
To help people with disabilities, let me first...
Yes, there is the statistical estimation that was applied by the World Health Organization to the whole world.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers double.
There is a study in South Africa that saw and proved.
It is certain that the statistics that emerged about the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza...
Every killed person is met by three disabled ones.
And since our Arab region has become, without dispute, a region of conflicts.
So even the suggestion that Bahjat Korwan put forward...
One percent will not be enough.
To support people with disabilities in the Arab region, if:

That requires addressing their problems and needs.

True, this also relates to the culture of the society and sometimes to constraints.

I am also pleased to welcome the brilliant captain to the ranks of the Umm Salal Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali.
Welcome! (Singular feminine)
Good morning.
I'll leave the congratulations to you all. Each one will congratulate at their own pace, as I step aside.
I had an open studio for five hours, and before that, I had two hours without any appointments.
I congratulate the State of Qatar, its land, government, and people, who surely deserve this global achievement.
Perhaps I got this opportunity to congratulate and bless Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He is the heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim.
Yes, of course, Lana. You are from the field of sports and work in this area, and you are familiar with these lines and this field to a large extent.

It's not a night because our file is rich and comprehensive, supported by many ambassadors. Let's say the fields.
Some people were afraid that perhaps there might be something like America.
And perhaps in some countries, these things are already in place, so there is no need to prepare stadiums and some of the special projects for this event.
Because they are all ready now.
They were just afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you are champions. I expect this is a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect he will venture into the fields of political economy and health.
The text "بس كرياظيين" translates to "Only Christians."
What does this achievement quantify?
Of course, it's a great achievement, especially for us athletes. Even non-athletes can see how happy they are.
Insha'Allah, Ali informed me about this moments ago, when the announcement was made.

Lana, you are definitely included in this topic.
And especially the sports channels.
How did they celebrate this occasion, and what was their reaction?
There were media from many countries around the world.
My main teacher has become really clear on the map, known as Qatar.
Of course, it also means the presence of the player in the national team, which is a very important job.
And I expect that this is a great responsibility on his shoulders.
What's your opinion on this specific point?
Alright, Captain Ali, what are the characteristics that a player joining this team should possess?
Now, on more than one sporting occasion, it's on its way.
And we, meaning now, have to raise a strong generation.
He understands the basic rules and mathematical techniques of football in a studied manner.
What are the rules that need to be followed and the basics that need to be present in this player?

What confines you like this puts you in a certain side.

Of course, we definitely wish for that, especially since the World Cup means that any player now...
This means that even just watching a World Cup match makes one happy and excited, so imagine how much more thrilling it would be to actually play in the World Cup.
I hope they live up to expectations, God willing. This is their chance, God willing.

And Qatar, how can we introduce sports to women, children, and youth?
"Connecting them together means that everything is complementary to sports."
Women have a role in various fields of sports.
Awareness of sports has now spread among all individuals, from young to old, in this society.
It takes about ten years, or even sixteen years, to reach this occasion. I think it's enough time.
Because the new generations keep coming up with new ways.
In the current generation, people are growing up, but in the generation after them, it's also necessary to instill a sporting culture from a young age.
Aspire, the Aspire Tower, is a landmark that we cannot deny, a great founding monument.
My action and the number one for the new generation of sports.
We just need to set our intentions and go for it.
They love football in particular.
How can I engage the audience to continuously interact with all the different matches, especially between clubs?
By God, this is indeed a problem in the Qatari league, which is the lack of audiences.
But we still have this problem of attendance. The Qatar Football Association hasn't yet found a solution to attract audiences.
What is the style we need to attract them to follow these matches?
It depends on the person themselves, some people don't like to attend the stadium.
The media plays a key role in the idea of public abstention.
And now they have implemented a ticket system or a point accumulation system, a point accumulation system.
No, union means he has a plan with several steps to attract the masses.
Some clubs have methods, like Al-Rayyan, to attract fans. Of course, Al-Rayyan is wealthy, so they don't really need fans.
Some clubs need some of the club's administrations to organize activities and events.
The public's right is to be encouraged. I believe these are the means I have.

God willing, Captain Ali has the final word in this interview.
I say to them, "Congratulations, and may you continue to succeed, God willing."
Thank you, Captain and Player, for sharing your journey with us. We wish you all the best, God willing, in your sports career and in your life. May God bless you.
Let's make us love sports more and more.
The topic of the episode is young talents.
Some young people like these songs, which are popular now, but they have a very deep and long history.
A group of young people are singing either Arabic words or English words.
Today, we're going to continue this discussion with a group of rap enthusiasts.
And we will get to know them a lot through our meeting that will bring us together on air.
Welcome, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new style of singing has spread across the Arab world and the Gulf.
Coming from the west, specifically America, is the rap singing.
And before delving into the topic of rap music
There is a boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding writing song lyrics
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are numerous and important, and we will get to know them from two people who are strongly involved in this field.
They formed a nice band.
Good morning Yusuf Al Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah Yusuf.
Welcome, Salman. Good morning.
Good morning, welcome.
I am very happy to have you with us through, of course, this program.
And also, of course, the subject of rap singing.
What do you have to do with the subject, Youssef?
We realized that rap music didn't exist in our area.
"It's the sweetest."
In the language of the citizen.
Some of them are cheerful, some are sad, and some address political topics.
Yes, I am the first one to rap.
And these songs, I believe, are an art form, just as a visual artist paints a picture, a poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the musician can play any instrument.
There seems to be acceptance from the Qatari society and the Gulf community for this type of music.
The translation of
It seems that people have started to enjoy collecting rap music CDs.
Different ages
And there are families, and there are many people who have started to listen more than before.
"So it was like a website."
And how many of you are there in this group so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry, and perform it in a rap style.
The rapper, and God, as you say, you can say that he is the one who sings to himself.
He is the one who plays sometimes and he is the one who writes the lyrics.
Oh, okay.
Listen to him, by God, I recorded this song.
Okay, now all these songs you produced, are they from Salman, from Yusuf, from anyone, or from the same band?
You didn't think it would be available on a CD sold in the market?
But you know that when you're a character, it means I'll go make an album and put it on the market. That's difficult; it's a commercial record and there are procedures involved.
Okay, why didn't you think that you are twenty-five in number, meaning that one hand doesn't clap alone?
It's necessary for you to have, God willing, twenty-five hands. May God preserve you all as young people and brothers.
You made this CD. You can promote it through multiple websites on the internet.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have access through local newspapers.
There are thirteen songs, I think.
Registration is not right now.
"It was a little old, but it
The quality is a bit low, but it's not as bad as it is now, it's clear.
And he just burned about fifty CDs.
It means I can't not say what's in it because some young people might have known this art for ten years.
It's not about the strength of the recording, and I expect the distribution to be different during this period now.
And especially since there's a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music genres now.
These are the young people or the artists who produce a large collection of beautiful songs.
I also want to talk about the parties you attended.
And God, you know, the party that is, in Doha, we participated in one party.
Of course, it was organized for us by Al Sadd Club, so they didn't join us.
I don't see the audience.
"We see something, which means we d
What surprised us was that the families were more numerous.
Families are more important than youth.
The sentence "من الى وكان تنظيم يعني
We were a bit confused, and it was our first time in Doha.
That means we expected no interest.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It's been a long time since I've enjoyed songs like this.
Okay, let's hear a phrase or some lyrics from one of the songs you wrote, which were released to the public and were well-received by young people in particular.
For example, let's hear some words and also show them to the viewer.
"And we can hear it
At your convenience, please.
"Please stay
The problem is that I'm a bit confused.
Let's hear it.
The pro
We have with us now the Doha Morning program.
One might wake up in the morning with a positive mindset.
Salman is like a mountain, he's been in rap for five years.
One can't even accept being poor.
I brought a lot of people according to their mood.
I need to memorize some words.
Okay, so from the songs you've sung, give me a sentence from one of the lyrics, for example.
He's saying not all songs are random, meaning what he's saying now is what they call in English "freestyle."
That means "on the same weight" or "in the same meter" (depending on the context).
But when we sing a song, it means that we compose the lyrics with intention.
"Thank you. Let's keep following up on it."
We can say "Good morning, my country, good morning, Qatar, with the Doha Morning program."
Keep being present and live on air directly for the viewers.
They see one, one to one, what they do is display a bit of art.
We have the "Sabah Al-Doha" program.
Of course, the beautiful song you saw.
I'm insisting now on youth being present online and everywhere.
"I really greet you
"She was a subscriber,
Each one of us is a world unto themselves, each one of us is a universe unto themselves.
I feel that Youssef can't quite accept my words, or that he takes them but can't act on them.
So everyone takes words.
We certainly expect that every artist, every painter, and every poet is always...
He can also write about his love for sports.
In the love of the homeland itself.
Surely you participated in the National Day through the march.
Through beautiful songs, since you are Qatari youth, you also represent Qatar.
Doha is getting ready to host the Asian Cup, and there is a large parade on the Corniche.
To welcome this event
And we are showing you these clips to welcome, of course.
Doha welcomes the Asian Cup.
From Doha Airport until now
And we continue together these scenes live.
"It's just amazing to see these crowds, our students, here today."
And I arrived at Doha Airport early this morning to complete the Asian Cup.
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's go back to our guests Youssef and Salman, who are lighting up the studio.
The translation of the provided text into English is: "The illusion of the Arab Gulf Qatari rap scene is real."
We can say that about you.
"And God is, that is, we
I'm planning a party, but it's not final yet.
Only now are you working on a specific event, and it will be announced, God willing, by Youssef.
Inshallah, but it's not certain. So far, it's just the beginning of the journey.
"The beginning of the journey, we wish you all the best. Be assured that our program, God willing, will be your supporter with all our hearts."
It also means, Salman, where do you all work as young people, twenty-five of you?
Where is the meeting taking place? How do you organize ideas and write them down together?
Sure, there should be collaborative songs.
It's not necessary for only one person, whether it's Salman or Yusuf or anyone else, to sing an entire song.
There needs to be several harmonies between you: where you work, when you work.
By God, see, gathering twenty-five people at once is difficult.
So I started talking to Youssef and talking to so-and-so, and I talked to them about maybe meeting up somewhere today.
So I can see the idea of the song and the lyrics.
He is on his way again.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Send it to him and he will complete it.
"This will be yours, Yusuf. He will register and will send me some photos."
"See the experiences that are available outside." Note: The repetition
"Taking" means "acquiring" some CDs by great artists.
"You gain a little experience, you take some
Hey, of course, we always mean it.
Artists who have been in this field for many years or who have experience and a reputation in this field.
One hears them, sees their methods and ways, and tries to develop their own style, without merely imitating others.
So, what if I do the same style, the same tone of voice, the same level of words?
I'm just imitating myself. I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something specific to me.
"That means we'll use them a little."
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive style, let's follow this report together, benefit, and also enjoy watching it with each other.
The mystery still surrounds that talent enjoyed by some people.

Keep being present and live on air directly for the viewers.
And don't forget the program airs at 9:30 in the morning, so everyone will be in front of the TV.
They see one, one to one, what they do is display a bit of art.
We have the "Sabah Al-Doha" program.
With us in the numbers is Hassan Naama, and with us in the presentation is Shima Al-Hamadi.

Let's talk, Professor Abdullah, about the various activities that we will hopefully see in the coming days.
Yes, by God, there are surprises, of course. But they passed by quickly.
The ideas are there if you love to mention some of the projects that are presented.
For example, this idea of underground transportation is primarily intelligent or creative in that...
Everyone who leaves their house has a purpose.
They gather at a certain point.
Of course, these are all the images that the viewers are watching, I expect them to enjoy them.
The translation of "ابداعات ال الاطفال" into English is: **Children's Creations**

We also have promising preachers in Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony; she's a presenter.
We really mean that we love to open our hearts and doors to all children who want to present their programs.
And then they set off.
And we need support for this as well, and their presence is a top priority for us.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.

According to your specialization, these are the projects and institutions.
"And what has changed for you?"
Of course, our presence in Katara has given us a strong boost and has provided us with great support.
And in a faster way
Of course, there is now a set of projects in partnership with Katara that are being prepared for launch, God willing, in the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what is related to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we're walking in it now, especially since we're in the season of preparation right now.
And thus, we build a promising scientific future for all children, upcoming generations, and the youth, God willing.
The message I want to convey is intended for parents, our young followers, and the children who wish to be involved through our center.
What we give now
Sometimes our children have ideas that we should neither underestimate nor belittle.
We must pay attention to her, no matter what these thoughts are.
Because actually, whoever thinks about this idea will develop this idea, at the very least, by developing the child's love for thinking.
It is very important that I take care of this.
I connect with him spiritually. I connect with him now. Our big problem is that most fathers...
Provides support for him.
Encourage him, thus urging parents and educators.
Those who give more attention to their imagination, the children of today, are our future. They are the foundation of this future.
It really means we've lived while wandering through this exhibition among their projects.
I was living in a dream.
It means in a dream, thoughts are all very wide-ranging fantasies.
And now the dream has become an undeniable reality. There are many dreams that have come true and become a reality.
Praise be to God, and we wish success for our children who were present.
Our hopes are pinned on you, God willing.
With His permission
I am of different ages and genders.
I have reached seventy projects.
Pioneering and innovative projects in implementation.
To talk more about this exhibition
National and Cultural Center for Childhood
Professor Abdullah also at the beginning, that is, he briefly told us about the exhibition.
What in its folds gathers many surely events, so what can we briefly say about this exhibition?
So it was a new pattern of expression for children to express their love, loyalty, and belonging to the homeland.
Of course, it came under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
In the exhibition tour, this exhibit came up.
He starts to grow with him until he reaches twenty or thirty.
Of course, we started training the children to visualize the twenty-sided and thirty-sided polygons with their five axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, and environmental development.
"First, he knows what it means now, Qatar in the twenties and thirties, where will it reach?"
Then he starts thinking about how his way of thinking.
How does one innovate and come up with creative ideas?
I expect so, meaning his field, praise be to God, is expansive.
But when we give him certain symbols and help him
I expect his thinking will grow even more.
Professor, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Realities of Tomorrow."
It is the motto of the dreams of today's generations.
He will be part of Qatar's future.
And indeed, we noticed this while walking with the children when the child speaks, he says, "To the happiness of the minister."
I want you to inaugurate my project. I invite you to visit my project on the twentieth or thirtieth.
The child thinks after twenty years.
In it, he expresses his love for his homeland and what he is passionate about in his field.
Surely it is accompanied by various activities, events, and competitions.
One of them was the winner of the Stars of Science award.
And he was also among the winners of the first prize of the Arab League University.
Of course, all the children.
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were various shows on a specific schedule.
To present their projects that they have carried out, that is, during the exhibition.
The provided text is in
Stars of Science
Some of the winning projects that participated in the exhibition.
The one who also won one of the main prizes.
What is a forest or a reserve?
I'd also like to talk about coloured balls.
After the colorful atmosphere, of course, we were also part of the children's vision and dream of Qatar's future.
Also thinking in base twenty, or duodecimal.
How can a child contribute to an innovative idea project for twenty-twelve?
The main idea is to have a chip inside the ball.
It gives colour to the judgement.
If, for example, it goes like this, it means that everyone is watching the referee's movements of this ball through.
Or the movements of the ball and what changes in it through this electronic chip.
What is present in the ball.
Of course, innovative ideas are, of course, the main idea, which may surprise you. Many people ask us.
And these projects
We always say we haven't reached the children.
At this stage of their skill development, they are expanding their horizons.
I gave them an idea of a way to express their love for their country through these projects.
By giving them confidence in themselves, they can present their projects, face the audience, and explain their ideas.
In his fields of interest, in things he loves, all of this is considered an achievement, an accomplishment.
"And he offered support, which meant a lot to me and is greatly appreciated."
Now you are entering the stages of development and
With the support of several officials, the support of the committee, and I also expect the support of the public.
The forest is not the second one, it is the forest because of this child.

Large protected forest
The visitor can walk around and see the animals, I mean, the reptiles, under the ground.
And we sense on some animals and a research center that measures their condition.
In the marine environment and entering it in an innovative way as well.
The reason for her success is also her vast and detailed imagination.
This, of course, is the nature of her parents.
Of course, the one who speaks about a tourist city under the water.
Who is talking about a city of butterflies?
"Who is talking about a forest, a forest above the ground."
Who is talking about many tourist ideas?
The Arabic
Perhaps this is what children's minds need now, in this time, perhaps in 2030, 2050.
In the future, perhaps these things will actually come true.
That means there are three projects.
"I adopted these projects in the Scientific Club. I need them now, I want to work on them."
Project, for example, which is the cooling of water.
Let's see the Arab newspaper now.
And the news says: Qatar University celebrates graduation.
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, President of the University.
A good achievement is definitely recorded, meaning for the beautiful university.
The Qatari society is also a tribal society.
Also, these good news that we are reading about our male and female students.
A pioneering educational achievement, God willing, and we wish them success in all specialties, God willing.
He is considered one of the young, rising faces in the Qatari drama scene.
And for how long, also classifications and colored threads.
And artist Abdelhamid Shersheni is considered among the artists who formed themselves.
If it weren't convincing.
He would not have been chosen for the projects being implemented within Qatar.
Currently, artist Abdelhamid Sharshani is participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Classifications Part Two".
We are pleased to have as our guest this morning
Let's talk to him about his participation in these two important works and about his overall experience.
Welcome and good morning.
You have illuminated the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I meet you and the first time you are present with us on Doha Morning.
And help the people who are struggling with the program.
And you are Lisa's sister.
Welcome! Let's start our conversation.
Let's go see.
I am a responsible and administrative man.
And I apply the laws.
All I can tell you is...
Bring the bisht.
Then listen, why are you coming to me?
Go see them if someone agrees that you don't have to return the bisht.
And of course, I had another question to start with, but since we saw this clip from the first part of the series "Classifications,"
Referring to Khalid ibn al-Walid
And some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marrat.
Many things and information are associated with this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more, we continue with you this beautiful report by colleague Abdurrahman Marshad.
We keep in touch.
For it is certainly a testimony from one who does not know flattery or favoritism.
Emphasizing the antiquity of this city or that
And as much as we see of its effects and hear what its narrators and poets have said about it
Their old and new achievements come as a rich record added to the city's record.
And Madinah Marrat is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is an ancient country historically established in the pre-Islamic era.
And historians have differed as to the reason for its naming.
Some attribute it to Imru' al-Qais, the famous poet.
And the spring to which it is attributed
The date of its establishment is unknown.
The Pre-Islamic Period
Similarly, the most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Mount Kumait, which is the subject of a proverb.
Because it is located in the city and attached to it.
These are also archaeological sites.
"It is frequent, and since this site is considered a tourist site in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
So the municipality of Marrat has made tremendous efforts to carry out its work.
I am in a park above this mountain.
And sessions for the parents and all the residents of the kingdom.
It was named after the great companion Khalid ibn Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight against the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
I also saw Ghadir Kamit.
It is a place where floods gather, and it stores water for a long period.
And it was one of the most important water sources in the past.
And among its effects is also a house that clarifies heritage.
Madinat al-Bahri, a city whose history dates back to pre-Islamic times.
It became famous for its poets whose poetry ignited poetry.
With its beauty, its sites, and its famous mountain, Komet.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed in the program Sabah Al-Doha.
The city is north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I wish we had been informed and the viewers had been informed about these methods and means.
As I mentioned earlier, our infrastructure has a very specific infrastructure.
We'll open an account for him, register him, and create a special file for him in our system.
Translation: "The email of his guardian"
This deception involves an increased focus, faster typing speed, faster reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guardian will have full control.
It's good that this deception is added to the student's file.
Access his son's file online.
And sees the extent to which his son has progressed, meaning...
And he sees his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
We really enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful child.
We brought most of the children present at the center and greeted them warmly.
I entered this center with a professor who is present through this center.
And we get to know her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, from her entry into this center.
Of course, this year.
I'll focus on work after Ramadan.
But of course, this always ends up overshadowing some works in favor of others.
And some people only watch television in Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV, and the people waste the month of worship with television.
Reduce, lessen, lessen the series. Let it be done over two years, isn't that better?
Of course
Inshallah, they will accept me in Ramadan.
But I send you all my best regards.
"And, God
And also in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion.
A fashion show was held at the Katara Cultural District.
We are definitely continuing with you with all our love and sincerity.
And it develops the abilities and skills of children to a greater extent.
Different from the various schools existing in this generous homeland.
We have a definite model; we talked to our guests who were with us.
Now with us is Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amneh?
Praise be to God.
By which rank currently
Professor Ibrahim, let's start by getting to know the materials that are offered through this center.
As an example, there is Sister Amneh.
He also went with her in the way or method that Professor Nesma talked about.
He feels there's a change in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods...
Things were changing in terms of his skills, his mindset, and even his educational level.
Scientific methods
One of the first things I do at the beginning is conduct a global test called the TONI test for the child before starting anything else in the program.
I'll start doing the second part of the test as well.
By which we can measure the level or the difference in level of the student.
A quick math test or some rapid-fire questions are about to begin.
Amana will calculate and respond live on air immediately.
Of course, Amina has no idea about these questions.
We agree with them on this matter.
Of course, I had another question to start with.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part.
What does your contribution tell us about?
Of course, after we presented the series of classifications one.
Of course, praise be to God, He has granted me success in several roles.
The translation of
I distribute the roles, of course, with the executive director Ashraf Shohata and the great professor.
Of course, it's an opportunity from Tar Company for Artistic Production.
Frankly, it's the youth's right.
Professor Ghaneem, of course, this year nominated me for the award.
Of course, every ring is different.
I have several episodes where I'm going to do character designs.
On the contrary, it's a nice experience, of course, the work is there.
A pyramid among Kuwait's pyramids, the great Saad Al-Faraj.
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah Malik Ali Al-Ghareer.
We have a saying like Ali Mirza's.
You also have a group of young people with you, Abdullah Adham.
We still have some of the young men, including Abdullah Al-Asim.
This has become the norm, working two jobs a year.
Maybe that's why Apple asked you what you were doing in 1997.
But what I didn't realize was that this thing, or your ambition in art, would be achieved.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study art properly, or is it just a hobby?
"No, I don't consider it a talent, I just do it."
I took art as a talent, of course. The one who supported and believed in me at the beginning was the artist Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the artists who considers me like his own son.
"I have something to
Of course, we're with the series all the way.
We got up, worked hard, and praise be to God.
Now, if it weren't for Tara, a big thank you to Professor Abdelrahman Al-Sulaiti. A huge, huge thank you to Professor Abdelrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait, in a year, around twelve to thirteen new actors emerge. Why is that?
"في عنده
Certainly, saying "thank you" means a lot. It's like giving someone a chance.
Just let me say...
We talked about the series Al-Sani, we discussed its categories, and we formed an opinion about it.
The killer feeling is also a bow.
And the foot is also a man's foot.
And with us is a definite model, with us is the processor, Professor Abdulaziz Al-Maiof Al-Tamimi.
Until this operation is broadcast live.
And let's see how we can treat the personality, for example, first of all, let me greet Professor Sabah Abdullah. Welcome!
The text you provided is in Arabic and translates to: "Welcome to you. Peace be upon you and God's mercy."
"If we start with you, Professor, please."
God willing.

Holding hands
Let's see the nerves.
It's as if it's a drawing or a message from God Almighty, detailing all the members of your body.
"What are its problems from the inside?"
I sometimes feel dizzy.
Headache and dizziness
Let go of your hand, let go and keep your nerves calm, yes.
This is how Professor Abdulaziz will discover a particular occupation through his hand, indicating that he suffers from a certain disease.
The one on the left has a mild inflammation of the middle ear.
In this context, the phrase "في الم طيب هاي ايش معناته استاذ عبدالعزيز" translates to: "In the meantime, what does this mean, Professor Abdulaziz?"
The translation of "الاذن عندك
"Who created me since I was little."
Here I feel pain too.

I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
She's giving him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
This translates to: "It means his thyroid is a bit underactive. He feels sluggish and lethargic all the time, with a sense of heaviness in the body."
Excessive sleeping.
"Either he sleeps a lot or his body is always lazy, he always feels heavy."
Chronic tonsillitis
"Can you see the tremor, do you notice a tremor?"
He's stressed, and of course you never walk barefoot, maybe the last time.
The brother is from Tunisia.

Does this massage also benefit children?
The pains are a right of motherhood, glorified be God, according to the measure of the stomach that fits the child's palm.
Most of our children sleep on what?
When he carries people, it's not because he likes carrying; people think he likes carrying, but actually he has a gassy stomach, may Allah excuse us.
As soon as the mother puts her breast out, she explains it like this, simplifying the matter.
The translation of "ايكون ف بطن يد الطفل" from Arabic to English is: "It is in the palm of the child's hand."
The hands are opposite each other, just as the child is opposite them.
Let's see if every mom can learn this move.
It seems like you're describing a motion or
This is a distraction from the child and the child's needs. It's a nice way to keep the child occupied.
Okay, as for discoveries, do you have specific discoveries, especially for women?
As we said, in every house, ninety percent, God bless them, are women.
First and foremost, beware of ceramic and uneven floors.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic tiles, the problem is that we tend to slip. It's fine to walk barefoot, but only on an even surface. This can be dangerous.
I walk barefoot, which is evidence that the absence of ceramic tiles in homes has increased health problems.
The land is cold and even.
When she was a child, she had problems with asthma.
"Increased more"
The woman is keen to focus on walking barefoot on her heels.
Now, the foot - the area of the heel of the foot, which is at the back of the heel.
From here, this foot is now below the heel.
This is the first discovery. The second discovery is on its way to facilitate childbirth.
Just focus a bit.
In the seventh or ninth month
As soon as you enter the month of birth, generally.
It means they didn't come at eight. The most dangerous thing is that she walks barefoot.
A pregnant woman should not walk barefoot.
If I enter the room during childbirth
"I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed. So shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, and let ripe dates fall upon you."
We know that Mary's sustenance was brought to her.
So, to the extent that I discussed it with scholars of religion, they said, "Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?"
I am not giving you the idea that God put in this science and inspired me with.
Shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree when the palm trees naturally sway, how is it coming?
Sharp like needles or nails, as you might say.
When the palm tree was shaken, it gave orders to the wombs, which were once heavy with fruit in the middle of the text.
The organs (or "entrails") have given us orders to facilitate childbirth and adjust the position of the fetus.
The fetal head circumference or something will adjust over time and become normal.
"Subhanallah, how much benefit this fruit has."
Handholding starts with a simple gesture and grows from there.
Some of them have made it a habit, while others know that it is indeed a science.
So they're afraid to tell you what they think of you.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz, your discoveries are indeed important, praise be to God.
I just wanted to know the last question, time is passing so quickly, praise be to God.
Someone wants to get in touch with you. Anyone who wants to get in touch with you has a specific email. Are you from there?
Here is the translation of the given text into English: "The mobile phone is available in the control room. Anyone who wishes to communicate with Professor Abdulaziz can contact us after the program."
Of course, I have the numbers for Qatar TV so they can contact us, and I took this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe this, God will bless you in your work and keep people away from you.
Sin as people do and make peace with everything, meaning whatever crosses a normal human's mind.
We just aspire for more good.
I always think of good.
Dear viewers, I hope you also enjoyed this segment, of course, through reflexology and massage therapy using the hands.
Also by foot
And we saw a live model on air showing how the person with us discovered what diseases he had.
What does it mean if we wish to benefit from you, and whoever likes to communicate with him can also read about him through the internet?
How to implement it if in the coming days and years if it will include more schools?
Good morning.
How did you manage this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The truth is that the obesity problem in the Gulf countries has become a big issue.
We were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth country to join them.
And this program means, frankly, that the First Lady in New York has taken a stand.
She came to visit Doha, and they had a program for this.
They offered it to us, and we accepted it; it's not bad.
It means our students with New York students with students, meaning Spain with English students.
We want to know how our students in Qatar compare to the rest of the world. This is something we strive for in the future.
Because we encourage fruit consumption among students.
He stopped playing sports.
Of course, in the fifth week, you have your family meal with the family.
Of course, it's killing two birds with one stone.

We are happy in school.

The family is aware that their brothers are enthusiastic about the food at home, so they started eating the same food as them.
It has become a pervasive phenomenon among students, and he even brings this behavior home to his family.
He goes and tells them that I did this or that they taught me.
The teaching staff or the one who provided this information to the students.
How did you choose him? How was the communication with the students done through whom?
Yes, we did, and God rewarded them for it. Several parties helped us.
And our brothers in Diet Center taught them about healthy eating.
And learn with Sister Ayesha Al-Tamimi about dining etiquette.
How do they organize? Meaning, how do they eat? How do they prioritize?
To teach cooking, sports, or awareness of the benefits of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, neither curricula nor.
How was the delivery of these ideas to the students?
In various ways, some of them were inside the school.
We organized a day at the Aspire Zone at the beginning of the program, where we gathered all the students, boys and girls.
Because this issue is not about a specific individual, it concerns all of us. It's about our children.
The students wondered how you taught them at the beginning.
That means you are saying the results were satisfactory.
But, are three schools or specific classes from those schools enough?
He is now, of course, the first experience in the world, the first things start, they don't start on a large scale.
Start at a reasonable good level where all the qualities are independent boys girls special
So that it aligns with, for example, our culture, our environment, the circumstances of families; families, for instance, accept certain things for their children and reject others.
Fibon are essentially participants in it, and it is truly important.
A student who is twelve or thirteen years old is at the right age to learn about their health.
This means that many people really want to be weak, but they imagine it to be impossible.
Some of the heroes we see in movies look like that, and their bodies are weak. This doesn't mean it's something supernatural.
We talked in detail, but unfortunately there are many weeks that we couldn't cover.
We can also remind them of it through the morning of Doha.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits or vegetables.
For humans know the benefits of fruits and know that if they eat them, it means they start to improve their health, which gives them morale.
Over in the fruit section, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruit.
So this is the point, for example.
Of course, diversification means that they competed; each school excelled with its teachers with different ideas.
The spirit of competition is the spirit of...
We gave them the big picture, and now each one can be creative.
The teachers here are the ones who trained the students, or do you have a special staff for that?
We train them, we train them.
So basically, teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Ubaydah said Saturday will be for student activities.
For example, these days outside school hours, they decided to adopt a prestigious school. They said they would organize a march.
We'll have a healthy cooking day as girls, okay, we didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking themselves, so the girls' work means they had more skill in this area.
Of course, thank you Rayyan Water for providing the full amount of water to schools for free. Rayyan Water has taken the lead on this matter.
So of course, it means more healthy water because he will need to cleanse his body of all these toxic substances that enter his body daily through water.
So this week we said the third.
It means his body started moving.
They can play football or basketball, but he doesn't know that these are the sports I love.
True, true, exactly. Some might want other games, while some might not want to play team games.
"How long has it
Professor Sayyid Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Patients Association, welcomes you.
And of course, we try as much as possible to focus on most of the important topics.
We thought it would be a good idea to get to know each other and inform our beloved viewers about what multiple sclerosis is.
Because even this title might be a bit strange to us. Go ahead.
The number of infected women is higher than that of men.
All the treatments currently available are merely preventive.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start fighting us.
We fought by hitting the nerve cell.
The simplest explanation for the public is an electric wire.
Covered with a layer called the lubricant to shake it off, it's the nylon layer.
Of course, it generally leads to imbalance, double vision, and blurred vision.
Leads to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In its worst cases, it leads to madness. It can lead to quadriplegia or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions in the human body can be badly disrupted.
I suffer from a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Theories suggest that it is a viral transmission.
It's a non-contagious disease.
And it does not transmit to children.
Some consider it a disease depending on the region.
But the equator, for example, was completely free from this disease.
Currently, we have cases on the equator infected with this disease.
There is currently no treatment for this disease because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have not been able to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a treatment for it.
The current process is a reverse process.
They are trying to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
They are trying to start from the back, in other words.
And perhaps we are a bit afraid of this subject, which means we can say that maybe this disease can come suddenly.
There is a specific category that feels this disease, meaning it is spreading among a certain age group.
He was globally ranked from 20 to 40 years old.
Currently, the international organization for the disease itself has reduced the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because the falconer's eye sharpens until the age of forty.
But it does not heal from the human.
Of course, as an association, we are open even to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, if it means through the Qatari Association for Neurological Diseases Patients.
What is the reason for the existence of this association?
It's a large set, so you thought there might be a connection to this topic.
Of course, I'll give you random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand infected people.
One thousand injured.
The number of infections in the rest of the Gulf countries ranges from one hundred to three hundred.
I was diagnosed five years ago.
My number was sixty-four or forty-six.
Are there any specific symptoms that indicate a person has this disease?
And we don't have confirmation that it's a virus, which is why we don't want to adopt a specific theory. This is the point.
The second point is: How do I know if I am infected or not?
This is very difficult.
I got lost, Professor Abdulaziz, in trying to find a specific point.
