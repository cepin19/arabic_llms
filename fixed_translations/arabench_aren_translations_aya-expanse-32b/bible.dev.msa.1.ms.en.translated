The genealogy of Jesus Christ
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begot Pharez and Zerah by Tamar; and Pharez begot Hezron; and Hezron begot Aram.
And Araam begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begat Booz of Rahab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
And Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah.
And Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah.
And Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
And after the captivity of Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel. And Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor.
Uzzur was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Ahimaaz. Ahimaaz was the father of Eliud.
And Eleazar begat Phinehas. And Phinehas begat Abishua. And Abishua begat Bukki.
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
"So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations." "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
So Joseph, being a righteous man, and unwilling to put her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
And this was done so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which means: God with us.
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to himself.
And he did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he called his name Jesus.
The translation
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.
Saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him."
When King Herod heard this, he was perturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So he gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them, "Where is the Messiah to be born?"
So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too small to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I too may go and pay him homage."
When they heard the king, they departed. And behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
And they came to the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then an angel of the Lord appeared to them in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him.” So they went away quickly and left for Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod.
After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."
So he got up, took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt.
And there he remained until the death of Herod, that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."
When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was enraged. He sent out and killed all the male children who were two years old and under in Bethlehem and in all its districts, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamenting, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more." Return to Nazareth.
Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, "Arise, take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the young child's life."
Saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
So he got up and took the boy and his mother and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
Saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.'"
And John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.
And they relied on Him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
"I tell you the truth, every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He who has the shovel in his hand, will clean his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." - The Baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John forbade him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let us do so now, for it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he permitted him.
When Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus faces temptation.
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was finally hungry.
Then the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
And he said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Jesus said to him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he said to him, "I will give you all these things if you fall down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came to him and were ministering to him. The beginning of his ministry was in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he withdrew to Galilee.
And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
That which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and those who sat in the land and shadow of death, upon them a light has shone."
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The call of the first disciples.
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left the net and followed him.
Then he went on from there and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And he called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. Jesus taught and healed the sick.
Jesus was going throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
So his fame spread throughout all Syria. And they brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.
So great multitudes came to Him from Galilee and from the Ten Cities and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
When the crowds saw this, they went up the mountain, and his disciples came to him.
Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.
No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Fulfill the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
"Truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."
"Whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. Wrath.
You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, "You shall not murder," and "Whoever murders shall be subject to judgment."
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother without cause is subject to judgment. And anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka' (fool), is subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
"If you present your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
So leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
"Be reconciled to your opponent quickly while you are on the way with him, lest your opponent hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."
I tell you the truth: Don't come out of there until you've spent the last penny! Prostitutes
You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you that you should lose one of your members than that your whole body should be thrown into hell. (Divorce)
It is said: "If a man divorces his wife, he should give her a written divorce document."
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
You have also heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not break your oath, but shall fulfill your oaths to the Lord.'
But I say to you, Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
Neither by the earth, for it is the place of his feet, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. (Matthew 5:37, KJV)
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.
"To those who ask of you, give; and from those who would borrow from you, do not turn away. Love your enemies."
You have heard that it was said, “You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.”
As for me, I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.
"So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
If you only greet your brothers, what more are you doing? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
The
Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
"So whenever you give to the poor, do not blow your trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full!"
"But when you do a good deed, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
"That your charity may be in secret; then your Father who sees in secret
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward!"
But when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
"When you pray, do not repeat meaningless sayings as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard."
Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
"You shall pray like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins, even as we forgive those who sin against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
If you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. Matthew 6:15
"And whenever you fast, do not be gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to others as those who are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward."
As for you, whenever you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
"So when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." Treasures in heaven.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
"The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light."
If your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. God takes care of us.
Therefore I say to you, Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
And which of you by being anxious can add a single cubit to his span of life?
And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow! They do not toil nor spin.
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
"If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
Therefore do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
For all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Condemning others
"Do not judge, so that you may not be judged.
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?"
Or how can you say to your brother, Let me pull the speck out of your eye, when you yourself have a beam in your eye?
You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye!
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
"Or which of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?"
If he asks for a fish, will he give him a live one?
"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. The narrow gate"
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
How narrow the gate and difficult the road that leads to life. Only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves!
"By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?"
So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"By their fruit you will recognize them."
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!' Wise builders and foolish builders.
"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was its fall!"
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Healing of a leper
And when he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
And behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "I am willing," he said. "Be cleansed!" Immediately the leprosy left him.
Then Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." The faith of the centurion.
When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.
And he said, "Sir, my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."
So Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
The centurion answered and said, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Only speak a word, and my servant will be healed."
For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith!"
And I say to you: Many will come from east and west, and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
But the children of the kingdom will be cast into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and as you have believed, so let it be done to you." And his servant was healed in that very hour. Healing of Peter's mother-in-law and others.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
So he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she rose and served them.
When evening came, many who had demons were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases." The cost of discipleship.
When Jesus saw the large crowd around him, he gave orders to leave for the other side.
Then a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said unto him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Calming the storm.
And when he entered the boat, his disciples followed him.
And a great storm arose on the sea, so that the waves covered the boat, and He was sleeping.
Then his disciples came to him and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us, we are perishing!"
And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
So the people were astonished and said, "Who is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Demon casting.
When Jesus had come down to the other side, to the territory of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
And they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us?"
And a great herd of pigs was feeding at a distance from them.
The demons begged him, "If you drive us out, let us go into the herd of pigs."
And he said to them, "Go." So they went out and entered the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.
As for the shepherds, they fled and went to the city, and reported everything, and the matter of the demoniacs.
So the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
The translation
So he entered the ship and crossed over and came to his city.
And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven."
And some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" — then he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed, and go to your home!"
So he got up and went home.
When the crowds saw it, they were astonished and praised God, who had given such authority to human beings. - Matthew's Gospel
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man sitting at the tax collector's booth. His name was Matthew, and Jesus said to him, "Follow me." So Matthew got up and followed him.
While he was reclining at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” — The question about fasting.
Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If they do, the new garment will be ruined and the patch will not match the old one.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and the skins are ruined. Instead, new wine must be put into new wineskins, so that both are preserved." The Raising of Jairus' Daughter and the Healing of the Bleeding Woman
While he was still speaking, the synagogue leader came and fell at his feet, pleading with him, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.”
So Jesus rose and followed him, he and his disciples.
And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment.
For she said within herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well."
Then Jesus turned around and saw her, and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that hour.
When Jesus arrived at the official's house, he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion.
He said to them, "Step aside, for the girl is not dead but asleep." And they laughed at him.
When the crowd had gone out, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
So the news about him spread throughout that whole region. He healed many who had various diseases, and cast out many demons.
As Jesus was passing by, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when he came to the house, the blind men came up to him. Jesus asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
Then their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this!"
But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that whole region. Another healing.
As they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.
When the demon was driven out, the mute man spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons!" But Jesus called them to him and said to them in parables, "How can Satan drive out Satan?
Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.

Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases, and they cast out many demons, and healed many sick people.
The names of the twelve apostles are these: The first is Simon, also called Peter, and his brother Andrew; Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Phillips, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus surnamed Thaddeus.
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Do not go to the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Cleanse lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not acquire gold, silver, or copper in your regions.
Neither money belt, nor bag, nor sandals, nor staff, for the worker is worthy of his food.
"Whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave."
And when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet."
Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for you.
Here I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
But beware of people, for they will deliver you to courts and scourge you in their synagogues.
And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the nations.
So whenever they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what to speak; for in that hour what you are to speak will be given to you.
"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you."
And a brother will hand over his brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
"You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved."
And when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a slave like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more his household!
So do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father.
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
So don't be afraid! You're better than many birds!
For whoever confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before others, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
The enemies of man are his own family.
Anyone who loves a father or mother more than me does not deserve me, and anyone who loves a son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
"For whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
"Whoever accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever accepts a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of a righteous person."
"And whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, truly I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward."
John the Baptist, not Jesus.
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
As for John, when he heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
He said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John what ye hear and see:
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
Blessed is he who does not stumble.
And while these two were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes are in kings' houses.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
For this is he of whom it is written: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you."
"I tell you the truth," he replied, "no one among those born of women is greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been seizing it.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
If you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah, who is to come.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling to their playmates,
And they say: "We played for you, but you didn't dance! We wept for you, but you didn't mourn!"
"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil."
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her children." Woe to the cities where most of my miracles were done, for if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty deeds had been done, because they did not repent.
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades; for if the works that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
Everything has been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"Because Nery is strong and my burden is light."
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and his disciples were hungry. They began to pick and eat the heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw it and said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
He said to them, "Haven't you read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the Law that the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?
But I tell you, there is something greater than the temple here!
For if you knew what I want: I want mercy, not sacrifice, you would not judge the innocent!
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Then he left from there and came to their assembly,
And there was a man there whose hand was withered. And they asked him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" that they might accuse him.
And he said to them, "Which one of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?"
How much better a man is than a sheep! It is in his power to do good in the world!
Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored as sound as the other. Thus did God's chosen one.
When the Pharisees heard this, they plotted to kill him.
Jesus perceived this and withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all.
And he charged them that they should make it known to no man:
That which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He does not quarrel or cry out, nor does anyone hear his voice in the streets.
A crushed reed will not be broken, and a smoking wick will not be extinguished, until justice comes forth in victory.
"In his name the Gentiles will put their hope." Jesus and Beelzebul
Then they brought to him a blind and mute madman, and he healed him, so that the blind mute spoke and saw.
So the whole multitude was amazed, and said, "Is this the Son of David?"
The Pharisees, when they heard this, said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
"If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges!"
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or how can one enter the strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for by the fruit the tree is known.
You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good person brings good things out of the good treasure in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil treasure in their heart.
But I tell you that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.
"For by your words you will be
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here!
When the unclean spirit comes out of a man, it wanders through arid places seeking rest and not finding any.
Then he says: "Return to my house from which I came." So he comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there; and the end of that man becomes worse than the beginning. So shall it also be with this evil generation." Doing the will of God
While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him.
And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
He replied to the one who said to him, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"
Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers.
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
**Like the Sower and Its Interpretation**
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
And a great multitude gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it. And the whole multitude stood on the shore.
So he spoke many parables to them, saying, "A farmer went out to sow."
While he was sowing, some fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it.
And some fell among the rocks, where it had not much earth: and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it withered, because it had no root.
And another fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
And another fell on the good soil, and it sprouted and produced fruit, one hundredfold and sixtyfold and thirtyfold.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Then the disciples came and asked him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
He answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
For to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
Therefore I speak to them in parables, for they see and do not perceive, and hear and do not understand.
For it is fulfilled in them the prophecy of Isaiah which says: "You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
For the heart of this people has become fat, and their ears heavy, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
"Therefore hear the parable of the sower:
"Whoever hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what is sown on the path."
But the seed sown on the rocky places are those who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.
But he has no root in himself, but is only for a time. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.
That which was sown among thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
But that sown on the good soil are those who, when they hear the word, embrace it and bear fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty." Like wheat and tares.
He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
While the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
When the grain had grown and was ripe, then the tares also appeared.
Then the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?'
He said to them, "An enemy has done this." The servants asked him, "Shall we go and gather it?"
He said, "No! Lest you separate the wheat from the tares while you are gathering it."
Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn." The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches. The kingdom of heaven is also like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.
He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field,
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the largest of all the vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches."
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables; and without a parable he didn't speak to them,
That what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things from the foundation of the world." - Interpretation of the parable of the wheat and the tares.
Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and came into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
He answered them, "The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom. The tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy that he sowed is Satan. The harvest is the end of the world. And the harvesters are the angels.
Just as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
And they will be cast into the fiery furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. Parables of the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. And for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant in search of fine pearls,
When he found one pearl of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a net that was thrown into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
When they had loaded the boat, they put out to sea, and he sat down with them. They also brought him the good fish, and he distributed them among all the people. But he sent away the catch of fish that was not good and threw it back into the sea.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
And they will be cast into the fiery furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Jesus said to them, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
So he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place. And
When he came to his hometown, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these powers?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did he get all this from?"
So they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
And there were not many forces created there because of their lack of faith.
The beheading of John the Baptist.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,
So he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
For John said unto him, "It is not lawful for thee to have her."
When he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet.
Then when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them; and she pleased Herod.
Then he promised by an oath that whatever she asked he would give her.
And having received instruction from her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests who were reclining with him, he ordered that it be given.
So he sent and had John's head brought on a platter.
So he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young girls, who brought it to their mother.
So his disciples came and took away the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Feeding of the five thousand
When Jesus heard this, he departed from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
When it was evening, his disciples came to him and said, "The place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
So Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
They said to him, "All we have here are five loaves and two fish."
He said, "Bring her to me here."
Then he directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. The miracle of walking on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain alone to pray. And when evening was come, he was there alone.
As for the boat, it was already in the middle of the sea, battered by the waves, for the wind was against it.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
Then Peter answered and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
And he said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
And when they entered the ship, the wind became still.
And those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
When they had crossed over, they came to the land of the Gergesenes.
So the people of that place recognized Him. They sent messengers throughout all that region and brought to Him all who were sick,
And they begged him to let them only touch the hem of his garment. And all who touched him were healed.
The translation
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
"Why do your disciples transcend the imitation of the elders; for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread?"
Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?"
For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
But you say, 'If anyone declares to his father or mother: "What you would have gained from me is given to God," he need not honor his father or mother.'
You have made the word of God of no effect through your tradition.
You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying:
This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
"In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
Then he called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand this..."
Not what goes into the mouth defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth defiles a person.
Then his disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
He answered and said, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
Leave them. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind person guides another blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
Then Jesus said, "Do you still not understand?"
Don't you understand yet that everything that enters the mouth goes into the belly and then is eliminated?
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.
These are the things which defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." - The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Then Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed."
He did not answer her a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying after us!"
He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
So she came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
He answered and said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, sir! And dogs also eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' table!"
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Feeding the four thousand
Then Jesus went away from there and came to the region of Tiberias, and a large crowd followed him, because they saw the signs he did for the sick.
Then a great multitude came to Him, bringing with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus' feet. And He healed them.
"So the multitudes were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the lame healed, the lame walking, the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel."
Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
So his disciples said to him, "Where in this desolate place could anyone get enough bread to feed a crowd like this?"
Then Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
So he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Then he dismissed the crowds and went on board the boat, and came to his own town.
Request a verse.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the morning: Today is winter because the sky is red with gloom. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot!
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
And when his disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
So they reasoned among themselves, saying, "We have no bread."
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have no bread?"
Even now you do not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?
"And the seven loaves of the four thousand, how many baskets did you take up?"
"How come you don't understand that I wasn't talking about bread? When I said to you, 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,' it wasn't about bread, was it?"
Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's confession of Christ
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Then Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall not happen to you!"
Then he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come with me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The
And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain apart.
And his appearance was transformed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.
So Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
So Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
So they lifted up their eyes, and saw no one but Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Do not tell anyone about what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "Elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands."
Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Healing of a boy with a demon.
When they came to the assembly, a man approached him, kneeling before him.
And saying, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; indeed, he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."
Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me."
Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him. The boy was healed from that hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief; for truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you."
As for this type, it can only be repelled by prayer and fasting.
As they were going along in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise." And they were greatly distressed. Temple tax
When they reached Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?"
He said, "Yes." But when he entered the house, Jesus preceded him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their children or from foreigners?"
Peter said to him, "I am a foreigner." Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free."
But lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take it and give it to them for me and for you."
