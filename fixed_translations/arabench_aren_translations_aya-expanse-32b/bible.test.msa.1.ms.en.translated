The greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a little child to him and set that child in the midst of them.
He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"And whoever receives one such child in my name receives me."
"But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that stumbling blocks come, but woe to that person through whom the stumbling block comes!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life lame or maimed than to be thrown into eternal fire with two hands or two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Just as the lost sheep.
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that is straying?
"If he finds it, I tell you truly, he is happier over it than over the ninety-nine that never went astray."
So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
If they will not listen to them, take with you one or two others, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses.
If they will not listen to them, say it to the church. And if they do not listen even to the church, let them be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I also tell you: if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When he had begun the reckoning, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
And if he is unable to pay, let him be sold along with his wife and children and all that he owns, and let that be paid to settle the debt.
The slave felt proud and bowed down to him, saying: "Master, give me some time and I will pay you back everything."
The master had pity on that slave, released him, and forgave him his debt.
When that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and he seized him and choked him, saying, "Pay what you owe me!"
The slave's pride accompanied him on foot and asked him, "Give me time, and I will pay you all."
He did not respond but went ahead and threw him into prison until he paid the debt.
When his companions, who were slaves like him, saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed. They came and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then his master called him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?
And his Lord was angry with him and delivered him to the tormentors till he had paid off all that he owed.
For so my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you do not each forgive your brother his trespasses."
Marriage and divorce
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
And the Pharisees came up to him and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"
He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female?
He said, "Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"
He said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
And I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."
He said to them, "Not everyone accepts this word, but only those to whom it is given."
For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can." Jesus blesses the children.
Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
So he laid his hands on them, and departed from there. The Rich Young Man
And one came up to him and said, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
And he said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
He said to him, "Which commandments?" Jesus replied, "Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.
The young man said to him, "I have memorized all of these since my youth. What more do I need?"
Jesus said to him, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When his disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished, saying, "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Behold, we have left all and followed you. Therefore what shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my name's sake, will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
Like the workers in the vineyard.
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers on a dinar per day and sent them to his vineyard.
Then he went out around the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
And he said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right." So they went.
And he went out also at the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
Then about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?'
They said to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, starting with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
Then the owners of the ten-hour job came and took a dinar each.
When the first group arrived, they thought they would get more. So they also took one dinar each.
As they were going, they grumbled against the Lord of the house.
They said, "These others worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat!"
He answered and said to one of them, "Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?"
Take what is yours and go, for I wish to give this last one the same as you.
"Or is it not within my rights to do as I please with what is mine? Is your eye evil because I am good?"
So the last will be first, and the first will be last, for many are called, but few chosen." Jesus predicts his death and resurrection.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,
And they will deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and to be scourged, and to be crucified; and on the third day he will rise." The request of Zebedee's sons
Then came the mother of Zebedee's sons with her sons, and kneeling down, asked something of him.
And he said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Then Jesus answered and said, "Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. But to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
So it should not be among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,
"And whoever among you wants to be first, let him be your slave."
Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of the Two Blind Men in Jericho
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
And two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Then the crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
So Jesus stood still and called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
They said to him, "Master, let our eyes be opened!"
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
The translation of "الدخول إلى أورشليم" into English is "The Entry into Jerusalem."
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples
Saying to them, "Go into the village that is before you; and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.
If anyone says anything to you, say, 'The Lord needs them.' And immediately he will send them."
So this was done to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, who said:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
And they brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them, and he sat on them.
And the great multitude spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.
And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried out, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying, "Who is this?"
And the multitudes said, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee." The cleansing of the temple
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
And he said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' But you have made it a den of thieves!"
And my uncle came to him, limping in the temple, and he healed them.
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he had done, and the children crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant.
And they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes! Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. The fig tree withered.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry.
Then he saw a fig tree by the road and went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. So he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done."
"And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." The question about Jesus' authority.
When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "I will also ask you one question; and if you tell Me that, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things:
John's baptism: Was it from heaven, or was it from men?" And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
And if we say, 'From the people,' we fear the crowd, for everyone holds John to be a prophet."
They answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." And He said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. Like the two sons
What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in my vineyard."
He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, Behold, here I am, my lord. And he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him. Like the vineyard owners.
Hear another parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
When the time came for the fruit to be ripe, he sent his servants to the vine-growers to receive his fruit.
So the chief priests took his servants and beat some, killed some, and stoned some.
Then he sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they also did the same to them.
So at last he sent his son, saying, "They will respect my son."
Now when the chief priests saw the Son of Man, they said among themselves, "This is the heir; let us kill him and seize his inheritance!"
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
So when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?"
They said to him, "Those evil tenants will be destroyed, and the vineyard will be given to other tenants who will give the fruit at the proper time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing its fruits.
"Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and on whomever it falls, it will crush him!"
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them.
And as they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes, for they perceived him to be like a prophet.
Like the wedding of the king's son.
And Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
So he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my feast, my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet!”’
But they all alike went away, one to his farm, another to his business,
And the rest seized their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he was furious. He sent out his troops and had those murderers destroyed, and their city burned.
Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.'
Go to the crossroads and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
Then the king came in to see the guests, and saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.
So he said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?" And he was speechless.
Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind his feet and hands, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
"For many are called, but few are chosen." Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entrap him in his speech.
So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to one's status.
So they said to Him, "What do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
Jesus, knowing their malice, said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me how the jizya is treated." They presented him with a dinar.
So he asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
They said to him, "Render to Caesar." He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed and left him and went away. The question about the resurrection of the dead.
On that day, some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.'
So there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and died, and having no issue left his wife to his brother.
And likewise the second and third to the seventh.
And finally, the woman also died.
For in the resurrection whose wife will she be? For she was the wife of all seven."
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, who said:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The Great Commandment
Now when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together.
And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,
Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
"On these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets." - Jesus and David
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
Saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "How then does David call him 'Lord' when he says in the book of Psalms:
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
"So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him a word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him anything at all.
Beware of the scribes and the Pharisees.
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples
The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses.
So whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but do not do as they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
And all their works they do in order that people may see them: they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,
They love the best seats at feasts and the front seats in the synagogues,
Greetings in the markets, and that people call them: My lord, my lord!
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. And you are all brothers.
"Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven."
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for there is but one Father, who is in heaven. (Matthew 23:9, New Revised Standard Version)
"And the greatest among you shall be your servant."
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a disciple, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound.'
O ye fools and blind men! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
"And whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated."
O fools and blind men! Which is greater, the offering or the altar that sanctifies the offering?
For he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it!
"And he who swears by the Temple swears by it and by Him who dwells within it."
"And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and He who sits upon it."
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
Oh blind leaders! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
So are you also outwardly appearing righteous to people, but inwardly full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
And you say, "If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
So fill up the measure of your fathers.
You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell?
Therefore I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and chase out from city to city,
That all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar, may come upon you.
Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Jesus weeps over Jerusalem.
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
For I tell you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'
Signs of the End of Time
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here on another; all will be thrown down."
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you."
For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will mislead many.
"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
But these are all but the beginning of the pains.
Then they will deliver you up in tribulation, and will kill you. And you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake.
Then many will stumble, and they will betray one another and hate one another.
Many false prophets will arise and mislead many.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
And these will preach the good news of the kingdom in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.
"So when you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
So those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
And whoever is on the roof must not come down to take anything from his house.
And whoever is in the field, let him not turn back to that which is behind him.
Woe to the pregnant women and the nursing mothers in those days!
They arrived so that your flight would not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
"And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened."
Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
For there shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
Here I have told you beforehand.
If they say to you, 'Behold, it is in the wilderness!' do not go out. 'Behold, it is in the inner chambers!' do not believe it.
For just as lightning comes from the east and is seen as far as the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For where the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
"And immediately, after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And he will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends of them.
From the fig tree learn this parable: When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors.
Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Ever ready.
"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"For as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man."
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
And they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so also will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then two will be in the field, one is taken and the other is left.
Two women were grinding at the mill; one was taken and the other left.
"Therefore you must stay awake, for you do not know when your Lord is coming.
And know this: If the head of the household knew in which watch the thief would come, he would stay awake and not let his house be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, for at an hour you do not expect the Son of Man is coming. Be like the faithful and wise servant.
So who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he comes!
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his assets.
But if that evil servant says in his heart, "My master is delayed,"
So he began to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with the drunkards.
The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
So he will cut him in pieces and assign his share with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Like the ten virgins"
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
As for the foolish ones, they took their lamps but did not bring oil with them.
The wise ones took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
In the middle of the night there was a cry: 'Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
And the wise women answered, saying: It is not enough for us that we should take this for ourselves, but let us go to the merchants and buy for ourselves.
While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.
Finally, the rest of the virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us!"
He answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. (Parable of the Talents)
As if a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted his goods to them.
So he gave five talents to one servant, two to another, and one to another, each according to his ability. Then he went on his travels.
Then the one who had received the five talents went off and traded with them, and gained five more talents.
And so the one who took the two weights also gained another two weights.
As for the one who received the talent, he went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's silver.
And after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
Then the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five more talents, saying, "Master, you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more."
And his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.
Then he who had received the two talents came and said, "Master, you delivered to me two talents. Here, I have gained two more talents besides them."
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.'
Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.
I hid myself, and I went away, and I concealed my weight in the earth. Behold, this is yours.
So his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed,
"You ought to have put my money in the hands of the money-changers, and then, when I came, I should have received my own with interest."
"Take away his one pound and give it to the man who has the ten pounds."
For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
And the worthless servant, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Sheep and goats.
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
And all peoples will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats,
He will separate the sheep from the goats, placing the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
For I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
Naked, and ye clothed me. Sick, and ye visited me. In prison, and ye came unto me.
The righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?'
And when did we see you a stranger and shelter you, or naked and clothe you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?
The King will answer them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me."
"Then he will also say to those on the left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels,"
For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me. Naked and you did not clothe me. Sick and imprisoned and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?'
He answered them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
Conspiring to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
You know that in two days it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
And they plotted to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But they said, "Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people." And they poured perfume on Jesus.
As Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster jar full of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he was reclining.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
"For this perfume could have been sold for much and the money given to the poor."
Then Jesus said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me."
For the poor you always have with you, but me you do not always have.
For when she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her." Betrayal of Judas
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will hand him over to you?" They weighed out thirty pieces of silver for him.
From that time on, Jesus looked for an opportunity to speak with him. The Passover meal with the disciples.
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'I am driving out demons and healing people today, and tomorrow I will drive out demons and heal people, and on the third day I will reach my goal.' In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow, for surely no prophet is killed outside Jerusalem!"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
And when evening came, he reclined at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."
So they were very sorrowful, and each one began to say to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "The one who dips his hand with me in the bowl will betray me.
The Son of Man is going to suffer many things, as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born!"
So Judas, who was betraying him, asked, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said so.” Last Supper
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you,
For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
And I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter answered and said to him, "Even if everyone else doubts you, I will never doubt."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" All the disciples said the same. In Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here until I go and pray over there."
Then he took with him Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrowful and distressed.
And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
Then he went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "So, could you not keep watch with me for one hour?"
"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
And he went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me unless I drink it, let your will be done."
Then he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
And leaving them, he went away again. And a third time he said to them the same thing.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Sleep now and rest! Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Let us go! Behold, he who betrays me is at hand!" The arrest of Jesus.
As he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying: "The one I kiss is he. Seize him."
Immediately Jesus came up and said to him, "Greetings, master!" And he kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" So they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus put his hand to his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think that I cannot now appeal to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?
So how do you complete the books: that this is how it should be?
At that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "As for you, you have come out with swords and clubs to take me as a criminal! Yet I have been daily with you teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hands on me."
And this was done so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled, even though they were standing before the Sanhedrin of the Jews.
And those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and he went in and sat with the officers, to see the outcome.
The chief priests, elders, and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death.
They found nothing. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found nothing. But finally, two false witnesses came forward.
And they said, "He said, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it again.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to him, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"
Jesus remained silent. The high priest spoke up and said, "I put you under oath by the living God: Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy!"
What do you see?" They answered and said, "He deserves death."
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and others slapped him
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter's denial.
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
Then he denied it all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about!"
Then, when he went out into the porch, another saw him and said to those who were there, "This was also with Jesus of Nazareth!"
So he also denied with an oath, "I do not know the man!"
And a little later the servants came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of them, for your speech betrays you."
And immediately he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people came together and plotted against Jesus to kill him.
So they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Then when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
And they said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself!"
So he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and went away, and went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money."
So they consulted together, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
That's why that field is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value,
And they gave him as a field the Pottery Field, as the Lord commanded me." Before Pilate
So Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, "You say so."
And while the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he made no answer.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
He did not answer him even a single word, which amazed the governor greatly.
And it was the governor's custom at the festival to release one prisoner whom the crowd requested.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, Pilate said to the multitude, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
For he knew that they had delivered him through envy.
While he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent a message to him saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I suffered greatly in a dream because of him today."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus destroyed.
Then the governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Then Pilate said to them, "What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all said, "Crucify Him!"
Then the governor asked, "What evil has he done?" But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. See to it yourselves."
Then all the people answered and said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then he released Barabbas to them. But after having Jesus scourged, he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers' mockery
So the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's headquarters and gathered the whole battalion around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a scarlet robe.
And they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, took the reed and struck him on the head.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe and put his clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified. Crucifixion
As they led him away, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull,"
They gave him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. And when he had tasted it, he would not drink.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots, so that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."
Then they sat down to guard him there.
And they put up over his head the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
And those who passed by blasphemed him, shaking their heads.
They said, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
The chief priests, scribes, and elders also mocked him, saying:
"He saved others, but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!"
"If it is God's will, let him save him now, for he said, 'I am God's Son!'"
And so also the two criminals who were crucified with him reviled him.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Then those who stood by and heard it said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone. Let us see if Elijah will come and save him!"
So Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
And they came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
Now the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, and they were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.
Among them was Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial.
When it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
So Joseph went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
And he placed him in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the sepulcher. The guards at the tomb.
And on the next day, after the preparations, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate.
They said, "Lord, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'
So guard the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
So Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you know how."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone.
The
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
And there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
So from his fear the guards trembled and became like the dead.
The angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here, for he has risen just as he said! Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
And go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead. He is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." - The guards' report.
As they were going along, some guards came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
So they gathered together to the elders, and they consulted, and they gave the soldiers much silver.
Saying, "Say that His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.
"If the governor hears about this, we will plead with him and put your minds at rest."
So they took the money and did as they were instructed, and this story spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to the disciples.
As for the eleven disciples, they went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some of them had doubts.
So Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to observe all the commandments I have given you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." Amen.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send My messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you."
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the land of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
And John was clothed in camel's hair, and had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying, "After me comes one who is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
"I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." - The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus Christ
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And immediately, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
And at once the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. The call of the first disciples
And after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.
And he said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel."
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
So Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then he went a little further and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were also in the boat mending their nets.
So he called them at that time. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went after him. He drove out an unclean spirit.
Then they came to Capernaum. And immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
And in their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. He cried out,
Saying, "Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent! Come out of him!"
The unclean spirit convulsed him violently, shouted with a loud voice, and came out of him.
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned one another, saying, "What is this? What is this new teaching? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!"
So his fame spread throughout all that region around Galilee. He healed many who had various diseases, and cast out many demons.
When they had left the synagogue, they went at once to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
So he went in and helped her up, taking her by the hand. At once the fever left her, and she began to wait on them.
When evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
And the whole city was gathered at the gate.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. The Gospel according to Mark, Chapter 1, verses 34-35
And in the morning, very early, he rose and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.
So Simon and those who were with him followed him.
When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
And he said to them, "Let us go somewhere else to the nearby villages, so that I may preach there also. For this is why I have come."
So he preached in their synagogues and cast out demons. Healing of a leper.
Then a leper came to him, kneeling down and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus, moved with compassion, reached out his hand and touched him. "I do want to," he said. "Be made clean."
And immediately, as he spoke, the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
He rebuked him and sent him away at once.
And he said to him, "See, do not tell anyone anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
As for him, he went out and began to proclaim and spread the news widely, so that he could no longer openly enter a town. He was outside in deserted places, and people were coming to him from every direction.
The translation
Then after some days he again entered Capernaum. And it was heard that he was in the house.
And immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door. And he was preaching the word to them.
And they came to him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four.
And because they could not come near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And there were some of the scribes sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,
"Why does he speak in this way, with blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?"
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you question thus in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or 'Stand up and walk'?
"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." He said to the paralytic,
I say to you, get up, take your bed and go to your house!
Immediately he got up and took the mat and went out in front of everyone; and they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" - The Call of Levi
Then he also went out to the sea. And all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Levi sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.
And while he was at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
The translators and the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The question about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
So Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, for the new patch would pull away from the old cloth, making the tear even worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. - Lord of the Sabbath
And on the Sabbath, He went through the grainfields and His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they went along.
The Pharisees said to him, "Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "Haven't you ever read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions?"
"How did he enter the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the bread of the offering, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and also gave it to those who were with him?"
Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Then he also entered the synagogue, and there was a man with a withered hand.
So they watched him to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him.
So he said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in the middle."
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save a life or to kill?" And they were silent.
Then he looked around at them in anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, looking for a way to kill him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee and Judea followed him.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan. And those around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what he had done, came to him.
So he said to his disciples, "Have a small boat ready for me because of the crowd, so that they will not crush me."
For he had healed many, so that all those who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
And he charged them that they should not make him known. The choosing of the twelve apostles
Then he went up into the mountain, and called to him those whom he desired; and they went to him.
And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
And they shall have power to heal diseases and cast out demons.
And he gave Simon the name Peter.
