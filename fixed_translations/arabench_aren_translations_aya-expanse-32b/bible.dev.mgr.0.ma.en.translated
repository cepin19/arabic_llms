Chapter 1: The Genealogy of Jesus Christ
These are the names of the ancestors of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren.
And Judah begat Pharez and Zerah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Aram.
And Araam begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
And Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse.
And Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah.
And Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijam, and Abijam begot Asa.
And Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,
And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,
And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amos, and Amos begot Josiah.
Jeconiah and his brothers were born during the time when the Jews were exiled in the land of Babylon.
And after they returned to Judah from Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
And Azur the son of Zadok, and Zadok the son of Ahimaaz, and Ahimaaz the son of Eliud,
And Eleazar begat Phinehas, and Phinehas begat Abishua, and Abishua begat Bukki,
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "From Abraham to David there were fourteen generations, and from David to the time of the exile in Babylon fourteen generations, and from the time of the exile to the birth of Christ fourteen generations. So all the generations from Abraham to Christ were fourteen generations." (Note: The original text appears to be in Moroccan Arabic, and the translation maintains the original formatting and structure.)
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. - Luke
Yusuf, her fiancé, was a pious man and didn't want to disgrace her, so he decided to break up with her secretly.
And while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
"And you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." - Luke
And all this happened in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by the prophet who said:
"Behold, the young woman is with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel," which means "God with us."
When Joseph woke up from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife,
But the firstborn son was circumcised on the eighth day, and he was called Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter 2: The astronomers came to see Jesus.
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.
Caesarean: "Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he and all the people of Jerusalem were terrified.
And he summoned all the heads of the religious leaders and the scholars of the law, and asked them, "Where is the Messiah to be born?"
And they answered him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
"You are from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am not too far from you, for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel."
And after they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
And after sending them to Bethlehem, he said to them, "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come and tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
When they heard the king's words, they departed. And behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came and stood over the place where the Child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy.
And when they entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother. They bowed down and worshiped him, opened their treasures, and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And when they had dreamed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him." So Joseph arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: and they were there until the death of Herod.
After the magi had departed, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
And Nāḍ Yūsuf took the child and his mother at night and they went to Egypt.
And it came to pass, when Herod was dead, that an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead." So Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings who were two years old and under, for that was the age he had learned from the wise men.
And thus the word of the Lord spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said:
From Ramah is heard lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeps for her children and does not want to be comforted, because her children are dead. The family of Jesus returns from Egypt.
Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
He said to him, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
And Joseph arose, and took the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over the Jews in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
And he came to a city called Nazareth, and dwelt there, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, saying, "He shall be called a Nazarene." Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter three: John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus.
"And John came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 'Repent,
And he said to them, "The time has come for
And this is the man of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, he wore a leather belt, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
People came to him from Jerusalem and all over Judea, as well as from the regions across the Jordan River.
And they confessed their sins with their own mouths, as they were baptized in the Jordan by John.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Yes, prove your repentance with your good deeds.
And do not say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you, if you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works of Abraham. John
And now the axe is placed at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
I will baptize you with water for repentance, but after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"And he will make his disciples study and gather the wheat into his barns, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." John baptizes Jesus.
After this, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John protested, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me for baptism?"
And Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water; and, behold, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter 4: Satan Tempts Jesus
And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness to
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and then hunger came upon him.
And the devil, who was the tempter, came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
And afterward the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple,
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the book of God, 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
And after that, Satan took a very high mountain and saw all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to him, "I will give you all this if you prostrate before me and worship me."
And Jesus answered him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
And after that, Satan left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Jesus was preaching in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John the Baptist had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. Matthew
And Jesus left Nazareth and went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
And so was fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had said:
"You, land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, The way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations, The people who sit in darkness Have seen a great light."
A great light has shone upon the people who dwell in darkness, and upon those who live in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew 3:2 (Jesus chooses His first disciples)
As Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And at that moment, they left their window and followed him.
And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And he called them.
They left their boats and their fathers and followed Jesus. Jesus was teaching and healing.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and every weakness among the people. Matthew
And they brought to Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases, those possessed with demons, those suffering from seizures, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.
And a great many people followed him from Galilee, and from the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan.
Chapter 5: Jesus' Sermon on the Mount
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain. And after he sat down, his disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Blessed are those who weep, for they will be comforted.
"The meek shall inherit the earth."
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
How fortunate are those who are merciful, for God will show them mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who help others live in happiness, for they will be called children of God.
"Those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good. 1 Peter 3:14" Note: The input text appears to be a verse from the Quran or a religious text in Arabic, and the requested translation is into English. The provided translation maintains the meaning while adapting it to standard English conventions.
"But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy." - 1 Peter 4:14 (New Revised Standard Version)
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven, for thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you. - Acts 7:52, The Holy Quran, The Book of the Earth and the Light of the World.
"You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34, 35"
We are the light of the world; a city on a mountain cannot be hidden. - John
And no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Mark
"Therefore, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven." 1 Peter 2:12 (ESV)
"Don't think that I have come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
And we have brought you the truth: the heavens and the earth will pass away, but not a single letter or dot from the law will pass away until everything in it is fulfilled. Luke
Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it. And whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me.
And I say to you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
"You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not murder,' and 'Whoever murders shall be subject to judgment.'"
But I tell you, everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be liable to the hell of fire.
"Or else, you brought your gift and placed it on the altar, and you were reminded that you are right about your brother."
Leave your gift in front of the altar and go make peace with your brother first, then come back and give your gift.
Make peace with the person who is suing you; you both don't want to end up in court. Before the judge sends you to the police, and the police take you to jail.
Here is the translation: "I'm telling you the truth: You won't get out of here until you pay the last penny you owe." Corruption.
I heard you say: "Don't spoil it."
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"Otherwise, your right eye could cause you to fall into sin; remove it and throw it away, for it is better for you to lose one of your limbs than to have your whole body thrown into hellfire."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell." - Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 (Divorce)
He said again: "Everyone who divorces his wife must give her her due rights. When?"
But I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality and marries another, commits adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
"And you have heard it said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
As for me, I say to you: Never swear, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
"Neither in the earth, where it is the place of his feet, nor in Jerusalem, which is the city of the great King."
And don't swear by your head either, because you cannot control a single hair on it, black or white.
But if what you say is yes, say: Yes. And if it is no, say: No. Anything beyond that comes from the devil.
I heard you say, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
And if someone wants to sue you to take your jalabiya, leave him even your underpants.
Unless one thing insists on making you walk a thousand steps with it, walk two thousand steps with it.
"And if anyone asks you for something, give it to them, and if someone wants to borrow from you, don't turn them away empty-handed." They want to be your enemies.
I heard you say: "Love those close to you and hate your enemy."
But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven." This is a translation of a passage from the Bible, specifically Matthew 5:14-16, into English. The original text was in Arabic.
If you only love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
"Or else you will end up receiving only your brothers. How are you any better than others? Isn't it true that even those who worship idols act this way?"
"Yes, we are complete, just like the stars in the sky are complete."
Chapter Six: Charity
"Beware of doing good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
"Or if you give charity, do not boast about it or announce it, as the hypocrites do in the mosques and in the streets, so that people may praise them. I am telling you the truth: they have already received their reward."
But if you don't give something in charity, your left hand won't know what your right hand is doing.
"Let your alms be secret, and your Father who is in heaven, who sees in secret, will reward you." (Matthew 6:4, New American Standard Bible) Note: The original text seems to be a mixture of Arabic and Moroccan Darija, and the translation provided is a close approximation of the meaning, assuming the intention is to convey a religious message similar to the one found in the New Testament of the Bible.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." - Luke
But when you pray, enter your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, don't start repeating a lot of meaningless words like those who worship idols, who think that the more they talk, the more God will respond to them.
"Don't be like them, because the One in the heavens knows what you need even before you ask for it."
And so we pray this prayer: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name,
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
"The bread that suffices us is our provision for today."
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
And we have been saved from falling into temptation, and from the evil of Satan.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
"But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses." - Matthew 6:15 (New International Version) Note: The original text seems to be a mix of Arabic and a local dialect, and the phrase "الصيام" (fasting) at the end doesn't fit the context of the sentence. I've translated the sentence assuming the intention was to convey a biblical message about forgiveness.
"But if you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces and make themselves gloomy so that people will see that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
"It's not for people that you need to pretend to be fasting, but for Him who is in secret, and for Him who knows what is hidden, who will reward you." Treasures in heaven.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven..." - Jacob
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
"Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also." - Noor Dat
The eye is the lantern of the soul. If your eye is clear, your whole being will be illuminated.
But if your eye is evil, all your body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
Not a single person can be a slave to two masters, because either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. Do not be burdened by this.
And so I say to you: Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you, if he were to lift the burden, could add even an hour to his life?
And why do you put so much effort into clothing? Look carefully at how the flowers in the field grow; they do not toil or spin.
But I'll tell you the truth: even Solomon in all his glory was never arrayed like one of these.
"Oh, you people of little faith! If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?"
On that note, don't worry at all and don't say: What are we going to eat? What are we going to drink? What are we going to wear?
Even those who don't know God ask for all this, yet the one in heaven knows that we need all of this.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Don't carry today's worries into tomorrow; leave tomorrow's worries for tomorrow. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Chapter Seven: Don't Judge Anyone
Do not judge anyone, lest you be judged.
Where the rulers rule, by it they will be ruled, and where the people express themselves, by it they will be expressed. Mark
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam in your own eye?
"And how are you going to tell your brother, 'Let me remove the straw from your eye,' while there is a beam in your own eye?"
Oh, you hypocrite, remove the large beam from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
"Do not give the sacred thing to dogs, lest they harm you and tear you apart, and do not throw your essence to the unfaithful, lest they trample it under their feet." They begged, searched, and knocked.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock on the door, and it shall be opened unto you."
He who asks will be given, he who seeks will find, and he who knocks will have the door opened to him.
Which one of you, if his son asked him for bread, would give him a stone?
"And why wouldn't he give him a
Yes, if you who are imperfect can give good things to your children, how is it that your Father in heaven cannot give good things to those who ask him?
"As you want people to do to you, do the same to them. That is the meaning of the Law and the Prophets." - Luke 6:31, The Narrow Gate
Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate that leads to destruction is wide and the way is easy, and many enter through it.
How narrow is the gate and how difficult the road that leads to life, and few are those who find it." The tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
The way to know them is by their fruits. Can you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
Thus, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
"By their fruit you will recognize them." Matthew 12:33 (New International Version) We should do the will of God.
Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.
"At your service, many will say to me: 'Sir, Sir! Was it not in your name that we prophesied? And in your name that we cast out demons? And in your name that we did many miracles?'"
At that moment I will say to them: "I never knew you! Stay away from me, you evildoers!" The example of two houses.
"Everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a man who built his house on the rock."
And when winter came and the streams overflowed, and a strong wind blew and battered that house, it did not fall, because its foundation was built on the rock.
Anyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built his house on sand.
"And when winter fell and the streams overflowed, and a strong wind came and shook that house, it collapsed, for its foundation was weak."
When Jesus had finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching, Mark.
He was teaching them as if he had the authority, not like their religious scholars.
Chapter Eight: Jesus Heals a Man with a Withered Hand
When Jesus came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed him.
And he brought him a young goat, and he bowed down to him and said, "Sir, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
And he reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do want to be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean.
Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them." And he went away and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town.
When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with him.
He said to him, "Sir, my servant in the house is bedridden, paralyzed, and in great pain."
And Jesus said to him, "Behold, I am going to make him well."
And the military leader replied, "I do not deserve, my lord, for you to enter under the roof of my house, but just say one word and my servants will be healed."
"Even though there are those who rule over me and I have soldiers whom I command, I say to this one: Go! and he goes, and to another: Come! and he comes, and to my servant: Do this! and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who were following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as great as this."
"I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven." - Luke
"As for those who were supposed to be in the kingdom, they will be discarded outside in the darkness, and that's where the weeping and gnashing of teeth will be."
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; let your faith be to you as you desire." And his servant was healed in that very hour. Now when Jesus had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
And so the word of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases." How then should those who follow Jesus be?
And when Jesus saw the multitudes making a fuss over Him, He gave orders to His disciples to go to the other side of the sea.
He brought one of the religious scholars close to him and said to him: "My master, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus answered and said unto them, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."
Another of his disciples said to him, "Sir, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus answered him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus is calling a radical departure.
When Jesus had gotten into the boat, his disciples followed him.
And a great windstorm arose on the sea, so that the waves were breaking over the boat; but Jesus was asleep.
And they came to him, brought him to life, and said to him, "Save us, Sir, we are dying!"
He said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and they became still.
The people were amazed and asked, "Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!" Then Jesus got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly, a violent storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"
When Jesus reached the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
And when they saw him, they began to say, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
And one of the pieces of straw was large and floating in a place near you.
The demons begged Jesus, saying to him, "If you drive us out, we will go and dwell in the herd of pigs."
He told them, "Go!" and they went in, dragging the whole piece along. It tumbled down from the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank in the water.
And they fled in terror and went to the city and told everything that had happened, and about the fate of the men possessed by madness.
And all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Chapter 9: Jesus Heals a Paralytic
And Jesus went up into the ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
And they brought to him a paralytic man lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the religious scholars said in their hearts: "This man is uttering words of disbelief!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
It's not easy, he says: "Your sins are forgiven," but he doesn't say: "Get up and go."
But I tell you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man got up and went to his house.
And when the crowds saw what had happened, they were afraid and gave glory to God, who had given such authority to people. Jesus chose this moment.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
And Jesus entered and sat in the house, and many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Him and His disciples. - Luke
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he replied, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
"Yes, let's learn the meaning of these words: 'I am asking for mercy, not sacrifice, because I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.' The question is about fasting."
Then John's disciples came and asked Jesus, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus answered them, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
No one mends old clothes with a piece of new cloth, because the patch will shrink and the tear will only get bigger.
Not even one person makes new wine in old leather bottles, because if it is made in them, the wine will burst the bottles, and the wine will be spilled and the bottles ruined. But new wine must be made in new leather bottles, so that the wine may not be spilled and the bottles not be ruined." The President's daughter and the woman who touched Jesus' clothes.
And while he was still speaking, behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, and bowed down to him, saying, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus went out, and his disciples followed him.
And a certain woman, who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment.
She thought to herself, "If I just pack my things, I'll be able to leave."
And Jesus turned around and saw her and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And at that very hour the woman was made well.
And when Jesus arrived at the official's house, he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion.
I told them, "Get out of here! The girl isn't dead, she's just sleeping!" and they laughed at me.
And when Jesus had put them out, he took the child by the hand, and the fever left her.
"He healed the two blind men." This is a translation of the provided Arabic text into English. The phrase "وداعت الخبار فديك الجوايه كلها" translates to "He healed" or "He granted relief," and "يسوع كيشافي جوج د العميين" means "Jesus healed two blind men."
And as Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
As soon as Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They answered, "Yes, Lord!"
And at that very hour, Jesus said to them, "According to your faith, so be it."
They were bringing their children to him to lay his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. Jesus called them over and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
But they went out and started spreading the news throughout the whole neighborhood. Zeydon was watching.
And they didn't know where to take the blind man, until they brought him a man named Zizon, who was possessed by madness.
When Jesus had driven out the demon, the mute man began to speak, and the crowds were amazed. They said, "Never in Israel have we heard anything like this!"
The Pharisees said, "He is casting out demons by the prince of demons!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The trial of Jesus
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. Matthew
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. - Mark
He was saying to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Luke
"Yes, they asked the owner of the harvest to send the harvesters to his harvest."
Chapter 10: Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples
And calling to Him His disciples, He gave them authority over the unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
And Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
And Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus.
And Jesus said to them, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans."
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And on your way, tell people that the time of the Kingdom of Heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
"Do not take with you any gold, silver, or copper in your belts."
No package, no two tunics, no sandals, no staff, because the worker deserves his food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
Neither the city nor the village you entered, ask for someone worthy to host you, and stay with them until you leave on your own.
If you enter a house, greet its owner.
Either those who fill the house deserve your greeting, and your greeting reaches them, or they do not deserve it, and your greeting returns to you.
"Otherwise, they won't accept you, you won't be welcomed in any house or city, and no one will listen to you. Leave and shake the dust off your feet; your actions speak louder than words."
I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for you. Luke 10:4-12 (New International Version)
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves." - Luke
Beware of people, for they will take you to court, and they will strike you with their prayers, Mark.
They will bring you before governors and kings because of me, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.
When they give you their hands, don't let go, no matter how or what you will say, because at that moment, they will give you what you will say.
It's not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father in heaven who will speak through you.
A man will hand over his brother to be killed, a father will hand over his son, and children will rise up against their parents and have them killed, Mark.
And they all disliked you because of my name. But the one who remained steadfast, even until the end, is the one who will succeed. When?
But when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student's path is not better than that of his teacher, nor is the servant better than his master. Luke
"Woe to the disciple who is like his teacher, and the servant who is like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more will they call the inhabitants of his house?" - Matthew 9:34, 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Do not be afraid of them, for nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, and nothing secret that will not be known. - Mark
Therefore, whatever I told you in the dark, say it in the light. And whatever you heard in private, proclaim it publicly from the housetops.
Fear not those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
Two birds are sold for one dirham! But not one of them will fall to the ground unless it wants to, with the one in the sky.
Not even a hair on your head is unaccounted for.
Okay, without fear, you are better than many birds.
"Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven."
But those who deny me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven. 2 Timothy 2:12 (not "blessings" but "the sword")
"I hope you don't think I came to bring peace on earth. I didn't bring peace, but I brought the sword."
I came to distinguish between a boy and his father, between a girl and her mother, and between a bride and her mother-in-law.
And he will go, leaving his house empty.
Those who love their father or mother more than me do not deserve me. And those who love their son or daughter more than me do not deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. When?"
"For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it." Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24, 17:33; John 12:25
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me." - Luke
"And whoever welcomes a prophet, knowing him to be a prophet, will receive a reward like that of a prophet. And whoever welcomes a righteous person, knowing him to be righteous, will receive a reward like that of a righteous person."
Anyone who gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple of mine, truly I tell you, will certainly not lose their reward.
The chapter describes how John the Baptist sent his disciples to Jesus.
When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
When John, who was in prison, heard about all that Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
He said to him: "Is it me who is coming, or are we waiting for someone else?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:
"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor."
And lucky is he who doesn't doubt you.
When the crowds were going away, Jesus began to speak about John to the multitudes, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
So what did you go to see? Some man dressed in fine clothes? Because those who wear fine clothes, they live in the palaces of kings!
They ask me, "What did you see? Was it a prophet?" I tell them, "Yes, it was a prophet, and more than a prophet."
This is what God says in His book: "Behold, I will send My messenger before you, who will prepare the way for you."
"But I tell you the truth: Among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
"And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force." - Matthew 11:12 (New King James Version) The translation maintains the same formatting and structure as the original Arabic text.
Until the time of John the Baptist, all the prophets and the law of Moses prophesied.
"If you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. (Matthew 11:14)" In English, the verse is translated as: "If you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. (Matthew 11:14)"
Eva, the one with two ears, listen!
But with what will we compare this generation? They are like some kids in the market who call each other and say:
We whistled for you in the lira and you didn't dance, and we wept for you and you didn't cry!
John went into the street, not eating or drinking, and they said, "He is possessed by a demon."
"And man came to eat and drink, and they say: 'This one ate and got drunk and only hangs out with tax collectors and sinners!' But God's wisdom is seen to be good from its fruit." Woe to the blogger who does not repent.
And at that time Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. #11:21 Sitting in sackcloth and ashes: A sign of repentance and mourning.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for you.
"Woe to you, Capernaum! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until today. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
And for this, I say to you: The punishment of Sodom will be lighter on the day of judgment than yours." Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 "Come to me and rest."
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Behold our Father, for so it was your will.
The Father has given all things into the hand of the Son. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and he to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
The chapter "Jesus Teaches on the
And he answered, "You give them something to eat." But they said to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?" And he said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Five, and two fish." Then he said, "Bring them here to me."
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing things that are not allowed on the Sabbath!"
He replied to them: "Didn't you read what David did when hunger struck him and those with him?
And how did he enter the House of God, and eat the bread offered to God, which was not lawful for him or those with him, except for the priests alone?
Is it not written in the Torah that the priests, while serving in the house of God on the Sabbath, profane the Sabbath, and yet they are guiltless?
But I say to you: There is here that which is greater than the house of God.
And if you had understood the meaning of the verse which says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," you would not have judged those who are blameless.
"Where man was born is the Lord of the Sabbath." Jesus was healing on the Sabbath.
And he walked on until he reached their place of prayer.
And they came to a man whose hand was withered. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" They did this to accuse him.
And answer them, 'Which one of you, if you have one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?' Luke
"Yes, a human being is worth much more than a sheep! That's why doing good deeds on Saturday is permissible."
Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stretch out your hand!" And he did, and it was restored, just like his other hand.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might kill Jesus, for he was the chosen one of God.
When Jesus had finished speaking, he went on from there, and great crowds followed him. And he cured them all.
And he advised them not to tell anyone about him.
So that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
I won't argue and I won't shout, no one will hear my voice in the alleys.
A split reed cannot be mended, A wick that smokes will not be extinguished, Until truth prevails, the righteous will not yield.
"And his name will make the peoples hope." Jesus and Beelzebul
And they brought to Jesus a man who was blind, dumb, and possessed by a demon. He healed him, and thus the man was able to speak and see.
And the multitudes marveled, saying, "Could this be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that this fellow drives out demons." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
"Or do I bring madness with Beelzebul? So who is it that your children bring it with? It is by this that your children will rule over you."
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
And how could someone enter another person's house while they are home and steal their belongings without first tying them up, and then steal their house?
"Whoever is not against us is for us, and whoever does not gather with us scatters." - Mark 9:40
That's why I tell you: Every sin and every act of blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." Luke 12:10 (New International Version)
"If you plant a good tree, its fruit will be good, and if you plant a bad tree, its fruit will be bad. You know a tree by its fruit."
Oh, you snakes! How can you say good things when you yourselves are not good? What comes from the heart, the mouth speaks. When will you...
A good person brings forth good things from the good treasure in their heart, and a bad person brings forth bad things from the bad treasure in their heart.
I tell you: Every idle word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the Day of Judgment.
"After all, your words will either acquit you or condemn you." The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were looking for evidence.
And immediately some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Master, we want to see a sign from you."
He said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so for three days and three nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth."
Just as Jonah remained in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man remain in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
"The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here."
The national road drives the jinn out of people, making them wander in places without water, seeking comfort but finding none.
He said: "Let me go back to my house from which I came, and when he returns to it, he finds it empty, swept, and cleaned."
"And just as Kimchi and Kidi went with seven other fools worse than him, and when they entered, they settled down, and the state of that person became worse than his previous state. This is what will happen to this generation that does evil as well." - Jesus' brothers and mother.
While he was talking to those people, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
One of those present said to him, "Look, your brothers are outside asking to speak with you."
And Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
He gestured with his hand towards them and said: "Here are my parents and siblings."
"For those who do what Murad does in the sky, they are my brother, sister, and mother."
The chapter illustrates the farmer's metal.
And immediately, Jesus got up and went out to a secluded place. And the people came looking for him, and when they came to him, they tried to prevent him from leaving.
And many crowds of people gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. Luke 5:1-3
And he repeated to them many things in the same vein, saying: "There was a man who went out to sow."
And when he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them.
And they fell into a stony ground where there was not much soil, and immediately it sprang up because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it burned them, and since they had no walls, they dried up.
And some seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
And some seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some yielding a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
"Yes, the one with two ears, let him hear!"
And they came to him and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
He answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
"For those who have, it will be given to them and they will be enriched beyond measure. But for those who have not, even what they have will be taken from them."
And I speak to them in plain language because when they see, they don't see, and when they hear, they don't hear, and they don't understand.
Thus is the prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled: "Though you hear, you do not understand, and though you see, you do not perceive."
For the heart of this people has become stout, And their ears are dull of hearing. They have closed their eyes; Lest they should see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their hearts, And turn, and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Luke
"And we will tell you the truth: Many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it." The meaning of this parable is like that of the sower.
"Yes, listen to the meaning of the man's metaphor who cultivates:"
Whoever hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is like the seed that fell on the path.
"And those who plant in the rocky ground, these are the ones who hear the word of God and accept it joyfully."
But the word of God did not take root in him; he believed only for a short time, and when trouble and persecution arose because of the word, he quickly fell away.
"And he who is planted among thorns is he who hears the word of God, but the cares of the world and the love of money choke the word of God in him, and it bears no fruit."
"But the one sown on the good soil is the person who hears the word and understands it. That one yields a harvest, one hundred times more in one case, sixty in another, and thirty in another." The parable of the tares among the wheat.
And Jesus gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And when the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.
When the grain sprouted and the stalks grew, the tares appeared as well.
And the servants of the owner of the house came and said to him, "Master, wasn't it good seed that you sowed in your field? Where did this tares come from?"
He replies to them: "This is an enemy who did this." His servants say to him: "Do you want us to go and remove him?"
And he answered them, saying, "No! So that the wheat may not be mixed with the tares."
Let the wheat grow along with the weeds until it's time to harvest. Then, I'll tell the harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them into bundles to be burned, while the wheat will be collected and taken to my storage house." The parables of the mustard seed and the yeast.
And he said to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
"Although she is small in love, when she grows up, she becomes a tree taller than all the plantations, even the birds of the sky come to nest in her branches."
And he added another parable and said, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour, until all the dough was leavened." Jesus spoke in parables.
And all this Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he did not say anything to them without a parable.
So that the words of the Prophet are fulfilled: "With the trumpet, we will speak and announce everything that was hidden from the day the world was created." The meaning of the parable of the seeds.
And that same day, when evening came, Jesus left the house and went out to the lake, with the three disciples following
And he answered them, saying, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
The field is the world, the good wheat are the children of the Kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the devil.
The enemy who sowed the tares is Satan, the harvest is the end of time, and the reapers are the angels.
And just as chaff is gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of time:
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They'll throw them into the lion's den, for there will be crying and gnashing of teeth.
But those who obey God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. So, whoever has ears, let them listen! — the parable of the treasure, the jewel, and the net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is again like a merchant in search of fine pearls,
"When he found a very precious jewel, he went and sold everything he had and bought it."
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
When they reached the shore, the fishermen got out and started sorting their catch, putting the good ones in the baskets and throwing away the ones that were no good.
And thus it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the sinners from those who fear God.
They throw civilians into the jaws of danger, and then ask where the tears and gnashing of teeth will be. — The New and Old Testament
Then Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes."
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things." Nazareth did not accept Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from there.
And he went back to his hometown, Nazareth, where he taught people in the synagogues, and they were amazed and started to ask: "Where did he get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"So not all his sisters live in our town? Where did all this come from?"
And they marveled at it. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own household." John 4:44
And they did not dwell long in that land, for they had no faith.
Chapter 14: The Death of John the Baptist
In those days, when Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, that is why miraculous powers are at work through him."
Now Herod the tetrarch had imprisoned John, binding him and putting him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother. Luke 3:19-20
"Because John told him, 'It is not lawful for you to marry her.'"
And he wanted to kill him, but he feared the people because they believed that he was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday party, Herodias' daughter danced and pleased Herod.
And that's why he swore to give her what she asked for.
And when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before him, and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, "Give me here in a charger the head of John the Baptist."
The king was sad, but because of the oath he had taken and the people who were present, he ordered that she be given what she wanted.
And send the one who cuts off John's head to prison,
They put it on a plate and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.
Then the disciples of John came, took his body, and buried it. And they went and told Jesus. Now Jesus was feeding five thousand men.
When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When he got down from the boat, he saw a large crowd of people. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.
And when the evening came, his disciples drew near to him, and said, "The day is far spent, and the people are scattered abroad into the fields; send them away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
But Jesus said to them, "There is no need for them to go away; give them something to eat."
I told him: "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish here."
He said to them, "Show them to me here!"
He commanded the multitudes of people to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. After breaking the loaves, he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate until they were full, and then they collected thirteen baskets full of leftover bread.
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walked on the water.
And Jesus commanded his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
And when he had sent them away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was still there alone.
The sailing boat was carried far out to sea by the current and was overcome by the waves, because the wind was against it.
And early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples, walking on the water.
When the students saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost! A jinn!" They cried out in fear.
And immediately Jesus spoke to them and said, "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid!"
And Peter said to him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
And Jesus said to him, "Come!" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the strong wind tearing and he started to drown, he screamed and said: "Save me, sir!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those in the boat worshiped him and said, "Truly you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many sick people in Gennesaret.
When Jesus and His disciples had come to the other side of the sea, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret.
They recognized him as the owner of those lands, spread his news among all the villagers, and brought all their sick people to him.
And they asked him to touch even just his garments. And everyone who touched him was healed.
Chapter fifteen: Discussions on the habits of the elders.
After that, some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked him,
Why don't your students follow the habit of the elders? Because they don't wash their hands before eating.
But he answered them and said, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
"Honor your father and mother, and anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death."
But you say: "What I have told my father or my mother is a gift to God, and I will not help you with it."
It's no longer his duty to take care of his father. That's how you cancel God's words to follow your custom.
O you hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
People of this nation praise me only with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
Uselessly they worship me, Since they teach doctrines Which are but commandments of men." The things that ensnare a person.
He called to the group of people and said to them: "Listen and understand:
It's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it's what comes out of the mouth that defiles them.
And afterward his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
And he answered them, saying, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted."
Leave them! They are blind guides; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit." Luke
Peter said to him, "Explain the meaning of this parable to us!"
He replies: "What, even after I finish, you still don't understand?"
Don't you know that everything that goes into a person's mouth ends up in their stomach, and from there it comes out?
What comes out of the mouth originates from the heart, and that is what truly defines a person. When?
Since the heart is where bad ideas come from: like murder, the corruption of married and unmarried people, theft, false testimony, and cursing.
"And this is what defiles a person: not eating with unwashed hands defiles a person." - The faith of the Canaanite woman.
And Jesus went out from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman came to him from that region and cried out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
But he did not answer her a word. They brought his disciples to him and asked him, "Should we send her away, because she is following us and crying out!"
And Jesus answered them, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But the woman came and fell at his feet, saying, "Help me, Lord!"
And he answered her, saying, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
The woman said to him, "Yes, sir! But even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from the tables of the rich."
And Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Many were amazed.
And afterward, Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, went up into the mountains, and sat down there.
And many people came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those with skin diseases, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
And the multitudes marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the lame healed, the lame walking, the blind seeing; and they gave glory to the God of Israel. Jesus fed five thousand.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people, because they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
And his disciples said unto him, "Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
And God took those seven loaves and fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples, and His disciples gave them to the crowds of people.
They all ate until they were full, and they took away seven baskets full of the leftover bread.
And there were people who ate four thousand dirhams' worth of food, excluding women and children.
When Jesus had sent the multitudes away, He went up into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
The chapter is a sign of the times.
Then some Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them and said, "When the sun sets, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
And in the morning, they say: "Today it will rain, because the sky is red and cloudy." You know how to interpret the weather, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times!
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 - The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
And when the pupils reached the other side of the sea, they forgot to take the bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." - Luke
And they say to themselves: "He's telling us this because we didn't bring bread with us."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you discuss among yourselves, 'We have no bread'?
Don't you understand yet? Didn't you realize that five loaves of bread were enough to feed five thousand people, and how many baskets full of fragments you gathered? When will you understand?
"And you didn't understand when seven loaves were distributed among four thousand men, how many baskets you gathered?"
How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking about buying bread when I said, 'You are in danger of yeast'? Be careful with the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And at that hour, his disciples understood that he had been speaking to them not about leavened bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter testified that Jesus was the Messiah.
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
And they answered him, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets." Matthew 16:14
And He asked them, "Who do you think I am?"
And Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!" - John
Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I say to you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death will not prevail against it.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." (Matthew 16:19)
And Jesus commanded his disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ. Jesus predicted his death and resurrection.
From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed, and on the third day be raised to life.
And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This must never happen to you."
He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
And Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
"Those who want to save their lives will lose them, but those who lose their lives for me will find them. When?"
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose his life? Or what can a man give in exchange for his life?
The son of man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each according to his works. When?
And I tell you the truth: There are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Chapter seventeen: Jesus is seen in his glory.
And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain by themselves.
And his form was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And he saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
And while he was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him!" 2 Peter 1:17-18
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise, do not be afraid!"
And they lifted up their eyes, and saw no one but Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
His disciples asked him, "But why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?"
And he answered them, saying, "Indeed, Elijah will come first and will restore all things,
But I tell you, 'Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, just as they are going to do to the Son of Man.' (Matthew 17:12)
And at that hour the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist. Jesus healed a possessed boy.
When Jesus and his disciples arrived among the people, a man came to him and knelt before him.
He said: "Have mercy on my son, Sir, because he has wind in him and suffers a lot, and often falls into fire and water.
"He ate your food, and they couldn't cure him."
And Jesus answered, "O faithless generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me."
And Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou
And they brought the children to Jesus and He laid His hands on them, taking them one by one, and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He said to them, "Because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
This type of madness only goes away with prayer and fasting." #17.21 This verse does not exist in many old manuscripts: Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2. Jesus predicts his death and resurrection again.
And the disciples were gathered together in Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men,
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up." The disciples were very sorrowful. Jesus pays the temple tax.
When Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
And he answered them, "Yes, he who made them has made them." Then, when he entered the house, Jesus preceded him and said to him, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes? From their children or from foreigners?"
And Peter answered him, "From strangers." Then Jesus said to him, "Therefore the children are exempt from the tax."
But so as not to cause them any problems, go to the sea and cast your net, and the first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you will find four coins in it. Take them and go pay for yourself and me.
