The eighth chapter of the Kingdom of Heaven?
And they came to Jesus, and asked him, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" - Luke 22:24
And he called a child, and set him in the midst of them:
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." - Mark
"Whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.
And whoever falls into sin among these young people who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the depths of the sea.
Woe to the people of the world from the things that cause sins! Although these things must happen, woe to the one who causes them!
Unless your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
"Or if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell." - Matthew 5:29 (New International Version)
"Do not wrong any of these children, for I tell you: Their angels in the heavens are always with My angels in the heavens."
"The Son of Man came to save the people who are lost." #18:11 This verse does not appear in many ancient manuscripts.
What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go search for the lost sheep?
I'll tell you the truth: if he finds it, he'll be happier about it than he was about the ninety-nine he didn't lose.
"That's why God in heaven doesn't want even one of these children to be lost." It's the fault of the devil.
"But if your brother has wronged you, go to him and argue your case with him alone. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother. Otherwise, do not hesitate to seek help."
"If he still refuses to listen, take one or two others with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses."
Unless he doesn't want to listen to them, tell it to the people of the church. If he still doesn't want to listen, consider him like an idol worshipper or a tax collector.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
I say to you again: If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by My Lord who is in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." The example of the servant who does not forgive.
And Peter came to Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" Luke 17:3-4
Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven."
On this point, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
And when he began to settle accounts with them, one of them was brought who owed him millions of silver dirhams.
Since he didn't have enough to repay it, his master ordered that he, his wife, children, and all his possessions be sold to repay the debt he owed.
And the servant prostrated before him and said, "Be patient with me, my lord, and I will repay you all that I owe you."
His master had mercy on him, set him free, and forgave the debt he owed.
And when that slave went out, he found one of his fellow slaves whom he used to ask for a hundred dirhams of silver, so he seized him and hanged him and said: "Return to me what you were asked for!"
And his friend fell at his feet, begging him, and said, "Be patient with me, and I will repay you."
But he didn't want to, so he took him and threw him in jail until he pays back what he owes.
When they saw their friends were slaves, they were very sad and went to tell their master everything that had happened.
He shouted at him, "You wretched slave! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me."
Eva, why didn't you have mercy on your servant as I had mercy on you?
And the lady got worried, so she had him sent to jail to be tortured until he paid what he owed.
"That's how he will do to you what is in heaven unless you forgive one another from the bottom of your hearts."
Chapter 19: Jesus Teaches on Divorce
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And many groups of people followed him and saw him then.
And the Pharisees came up to him and tested him with a question, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"
And he answered them, saying, "Have you not read in the Book of God that God created man from the beginning male and female?"
He said: "That's why the man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
"And so they will no longer be two, but one. What God has joined together, let no one separate."
The Pharisees asked him, "Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?" Matthew 19:7
And Jesus answered them, "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife for any reason except marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
He said to his students: "If this is the case with men and women, it would be better for him not to get married at all."
And Jesus answered them, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it is granted by God."
"For there are those who were born from the wombs of their mothers who are unable to marry, and there are those who have made themselves so by people. And there are those who have not married for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can understand this, let them understand it." Jesus blesses the small children.
They brought some small children to him so that he could lay his hands on them and pray over them, and the teachers scolded the students who had brought them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
He put his hands on them and walked away. The young man who was wearing the clothes.
And a young man came to him and said, "Teacher, what good deed can I do to have eternal life?"
And Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
And he said to him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
"Take care of your mother and father, and wish for those close to you what you wish for yourself."
The young man says to him, "I've done all these recommendations, so what else do I need to do?"
And Jesus answered him, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
But when the young man heard these words, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God!
The disciples were amazed when they heard this and said, "Then who can be saved?"
And Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
And Peter answered and said, "Behold, we have left all and followed you; what then will be our reward?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
And whoever has allowed, whether it be his father, mother, brothers, sisters, children, or his lands, in the name of my religion, will have what he has given up returned to him a hundredfold, and he will have eternal life with God.
"Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first." Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Example of Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He gave them a dinar for the day and sent them to his gardens.
And he went out early in the morning and found other servants standing in the market without work.
He tells them: "Go ahead and enter my paradise. I will reward you with what you rightfully deserve."
And they left. And he went out again around noon, and he went out again at three in the afternoon, and he added two more workers.
And he went out again about the fifth hour, and saw others standing idle, and said to them, "Why are you standing here all day idle?"
And they answered him: "Because no one has served us before." He said to them, "Well, go ahead and enter my gardens."
And when the evening came, the owner of the garden said to his foreman, "Call all the workers and give them their wages, starting from the last ones and going up to the first ones."
And he gave those whom he disliked five dinars each at five o'clock.
When the first ones came, I told them they would be paid an extra amount, but they also only took one dinar each.
And when they were done, they started complaining about the owner of the mall.
They say: "Those others only worked for one hour, and yet you pay them the same as us who worked the whole day in the sun."
He answers the King of the Mall, and says to him: "I didn't wrong you, my friend. Didn't we agree on one dinar?"
Okay, take what's due to you and go your way! And that's what came last, I wanted to give it to you like that.
"Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you just jealous because I'm generous?"
And Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the last will be first, and the first will be last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus predicts his death and resurrection for the third time.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death."
"They will hand him over to foreigners, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised from the dead." Then the mother of James and John came to Jesus with her sons.
Then came the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, and kneeling down, asked something of him.
And she said to him, "What do you want?" He answered, "Your maid will set my two sons, one on your right hand and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus asked them, "Do you really know what you are asking? Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We are able."
He told them: "Indeed, you will drink it, but the glass on my right and my left is not me who will give it, because it will only be given to those who found it for themselves."
When the ten disciples heard this, they were greatly distressed about Jesus and his brother John.
And he called them together, and said unto them, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and their great ones exercise power over them. Luke
This should not be among you. Whoever would be great among you must become your servant. When the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve.
And whoever among you wants to be first must be your slave.
Thus it is not as though man was created to be served by others, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men.
And as they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed Jesus.
And there were sitting by the roadside two blind men, who, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
Even though people asked them to be quiet, they kept shouting even more and saying: "Have mercy on us, Sir, Son of David!"
Jesus stood up and cried out to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
And they replied: "We want our eyes to be opened, Sir!"
Jesus had compassion on them, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him.
Chapter 21: Jesus Enters Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied up, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says to you, 'I need something for the Lord,' tell him, 'The Lord needs it, and he will replace it immediately.'
And all this happened to fulfill the prophet's saying:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" Note: The original text appears to be in Moroccan Arabic, and it is a quotation from the Bible (Zechariah 9:9). The translation provided is a literal rendering of the text, maintaining the poetic and prophetic style of the original.
And the disciples went the two of them and did what Jesus had commanded them.
And they brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus mounted them.
A large group of people spread their belongings on the road, and others cut tree branches and spread them on the road.
And the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, "Who is this?"
And the crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the buyers and sellers from the temple.
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.
He told them, "It is written in the Book of God that this place will be called the House of Prayer, but you have turned it into a den of thieves!"
And there came to him at the House of God a blind man and a lame man, and he healed them.
But the chief priests and the teachers of the law became indignant when they saw the miracles that Jesus did, and when they heard the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
I said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
And after he had sent them away, he departed to the mountain to pray. That evening, he spent the night in the city of Bethany. Jesus curses the fig tree.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside, and went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” And at once the fig tree withered.
When the pupils saw what had happened, they were amazed and said, "How did the vine dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done. Whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive if you have faith."
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will
When Jesus came to the temple and began to teach, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
And Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question; and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
"Where then did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
"Otherwise, we'd say it came from the people. We're afraid of the public because they consider us prophets."
They answered Jesus and said, "We do not know him." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons
"Once upon a time, there was a man who had two sons. He went to the first one and said, 'Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard.'"
And his son answered him and said, "I don't want to." But he regretted it later and went.
And the fox walked up to the second boy and said to him what it had said to the first. The boy replied, "Okay, sir!" but he didn't move.
"Which of the two did what my father wanted?" They answered, "The first." Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and those who use force have been seizing it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear." Matthew 11:11-15 The parable of the vineyard and the vinedressers is found in Matthew 21:33-46, not in Luke 3:12; 7:29-30.
Here is the translation: "Listen to one more parable: A man had a vineyard, and he leased it to vinedressers. He went away for a
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the vineyard to gather his yield.
And the gardeners rose up and caught the slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned another with stones.
And he continued to send more slaves than before, and the gardeners treated them the same way they treated the others.
And finally, he sent his son to them and said, "They will respect my son."
But when the gardeners saw the owner's son, they said to each other: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They tied him up, dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"Yes, but now the owner of the vineyard has come, what should those gardeners do?"
And they answered him, "Those evildoers will come to a bad end, and the vineyard will be given to other vinedressers who will give the fruit in its season."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
On this basis, I say to you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
"Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and anyone on whom it falls will be crushed."
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parable, they realized he was talking about them.
And they began to discuss how to capture him, but they were afraid of the crowds because they considered him a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-Two: The Wedding Procession Example
And Jesus spoke to the crowd again, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his slaves to call the invited ones, but they refused to come.
And he sent other slaves and said to them, "Tell the invited: 'I have prepared the wedding feast, slaughtered the fattened cattle and the fat calves, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding!'"
But they didn't keep it, some went to their fields, and others went to buy and sell.
And others among them seized their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
The king was worried, so he sent his army, destroyed those warriors, and burned down their city.
He tells his slaves: "The wedding is here, but those we offered it to don't deserve it."
Okay, we'll go now to where the roads meet and propose to everyone we meet about the wedding.
And the slaves went out to the streets and gathered everyone they found, both the good people and the bad, until the wedding house was filled with guests.
And when the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing the wedding clothes.
He said to him: "How did you dare to come here, my friend, without wearing your wedding clothes?" The man fell silent because he had nothing to say.
And the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' When will this be?
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
And the Pharisees went out and immediately began to plot against Jesus, looking for a way to trip him up in his words.
They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by people's status.
"Yes, tell us what you think. Is it right to pay the tax to Caesar, or not?"
Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the money and I'll tell you how to pay the tax! He showed him a dinar.
And ask them, "Whose is this image and this inscription on the money?"
I said to him, "Caesar's!" And he said to them, "Well then, what is Caesar's, give to Caesar, and what is God's, give to God!"
When they heard this, they were amazed and left him and went away. The question was about the resurrection of the dead.
And behold, some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what of the dead? Do they rise? And if so, whose wife will the woman be who has had ten husbands?"
Sir, Moses said: "If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother should marry his wife and father children in the name of his brother."
We had seven brothers. The eldest got married and passed away, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother to marry her.
And so it happened to the second, the third, all the way to the seventh.
And finally, after they all died, the woman died too.
"So, which of these seven will be this woman's husband on the day of resurrection? For they were all her husbands."
And Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read what Allah has said to you:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the people heard this man's words, they were amazed at his teaching. The Great Commandment
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, a lawyer by training, asked Jesus a question to test him, saying:
Sir, what is the most important commandment in Islamic law?
And Jesus answered him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second commandment is: Love your neighbor as yourself.
"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Luke 10:25-28 (Jesus and Prophet David)
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying:
What do you say about Christ? Whose Son is He? They said to Him, "The Son of David!"
He argues with them: "So how did David, by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, call his Lord when He said:
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
"But David himself calls him 'Lord'; how then can he be his son?"
Not even one person could answer him with a single word, and not even one person has dared to ask him any more questions since that day.
Chapter twenty-three, Jesus warns his disciples about the scribes and the Pharisees.
And Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples, saying,
He said: "The scholars of the law and the Pharisees have the right to interpret Moses' law."
Yes, do and follow everything they tell you, but don't do as they do, because they don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy and difficult loads onto people's backs, but they themselves won't lift a finger to help move them.
And otherwise, they'll do something just for people to see them, they'll broaden the gangs in their sleeves and on their foreheads, and they'll lengthen their jalabiyas.
They like to be in the choicest spots at parties and the front rows in prayer halls,
People in the market would greet them and call out to them: "Sir!"
But you don't let anyone call you: "Sir," because you are all brothers and have one Lord.
"And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven."
And do not let anyone address you as 'Rabbi,' for you have one Rabbi, and you are all brothers.
"Especially the great among you should be your servant. When..."
For whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. #23:14 This verse is missing in many ancient manuscripts.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single Jew, and when you have succeeded, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are!
Woe to you, blind officials! You say that he who swears by the House of God, his oath is not accepted, but he who swears by the gold of the House of God must fulfill his oath.
Oh, you fools and blind ones! But isn't it better, gold or the House of God that makes gold sacred?
And they also say: "An oath made on the slaughterhouse is not accepted, but one made on the gift above it must be fulfilled."
Oh, these hypocrites! Which is better? The sacrifice, or the slaughterhouse that makes the sacrifice sacred?
He who swears by the slaughterhouse is swearing by it and all that is above it.
And he who swears by the House of God, swears by it and by God who resides in it.
"But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Matthew 5:34-35"
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
Oh, you blind officials! You filter out mosquitoes but swallow camels.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
Oh you blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. (Matthew 23:27, New International Version)
And so, even when we are finished, we write to people from the outside as if we are pious and God-fearing, but inside we are filled with hypocrisy and sins.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
They used to say: "If we had lived during the time of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of the prophets."
And thus you testify against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Yes, continue what your ancestors started.
Oh, you serpents, offspring of vipers! How will you escape the punishment of hell? When?
"Therefore, We will send you messengers, and wise men, and scholars of the Law, whom you will either kill, or crucify, or expel from their homes, or turn back in disgrace."
That the punishment for every innocent blood shed upon the earth may fall upon you, from the blood of Abel, who feared God, to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
And I say to you: You will weep and lament, while the world rejoices.
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling."
And there your home will remain desolate.
And I say to you: You will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
Chapter twenty-four, Jesus predicts that the house of God will be destroyed.
And Jesus went out and walked toward the temple, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left on another; all will be thrown down." - Signs of the end times.
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one deceives you."
"For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many."
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, and you will be frightened. For these things must happen, but it will not be the end.
Wherever one people will attack another, and one kingdom another, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
But all this is just the beginning of the pain.
The clock's hands will mark the time of your torture and death. All the peoples of the world will hate you because of my name. When?
And at that time many people will turn away from their faith, sell each other out, and hate one another.
Many false prophets have arisen and led many people astray.
And because of the abundance of sins, the love of many people has grown cold.
But the one who repented even to the end, that's Ginger. When?
"And you will preach the good news of the kingdom of God in the whole world, as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." (Great Tribulation)
"And when you see it in the holy place, the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel - he who reads, understands!"
The rooster in the land of the Jews flees to the mountains,
"And he who is on the roof must not come down to get the things in his house." - Luke
And whoever was in the field should not return to get his clothes.
Woe to the pregnant women and the women who are nursing in those days.
Make sure your escape isn't in the winter or on a Saturday.
I sacrifice my time to you, for you will witness a great calamity that has never occurred since the creation of the world until now, and will never happen again after this. The vision.
And if it were not for the fact that Allah had decreed a specified time, no soul would have been saved [from punishment], but [He grants] reprieve to whom He wills.
And then the rooster said to you: Behold, Christ is here, or he's right there! Don't believe him.
"For there shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and they shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, they would deceive the very elect."
Yes, Hany taught you before.
They told you: He's in the desert! Don't go out, or else he's in the inner houses! Don't trust them. Luke
For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.

3:15; Revelation 6:12; 3:15; Revelation 6:13 "After the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And then you will see the sign of the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory. And then he will send his angels and will gather his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. Vision.
"And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." - The parable of the vine.
"Learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branches become tender and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near."
And so when you see all these things happening, know that he is about to come, for he is at the doors.
I'll tell you the truth: This generation won't amount to anything until all these things happen.
"The way to heaven and earth has been shown to us, but my words will never pass away." The day and hour no one knows.
"But that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, right up to the day Noah entered the ark.
And they knew not what would happen, until the flood came and took them all. So will be the coming of the Son of Man.
By the clock, there will be two of them in the field; he will take one and leave the other.

And you should know that if the homeowner had known what time the thief would come at night, he would have stayed up and not let him steal his house. Luke
"For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and abound, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." (2 Peter 1:5-8, English Standard Version) The example of the faithful servant.
"And who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?"
Happy is the servant whom his lord finds doing the work that he was commanded to do.
I'll tell you the truth: it's going to cost him everything he has.
"But that servant was ugly and said to himself: 'My master will be delayed in his return.'"
And he started beating his slave companions and eating and drinking with the drunkards,
Gigi, you are that servant. One day he didn't count on him and at a time he didn't know him.
He will be severely punished and will be treated like the hypocrites. Then where will be the crying and the gnashing of teeth?
Chapter twenty-five: The example of the ten virgins
"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Matthew 25:1 (New International Version)
And they were five of them foolish and five others wise.
And they shook those five brilliant flashlights without taking the oil with them in excess.
As for the five wise ones, they took their lamps and oil in their flasks.
And when the groom arrives, all the single women start flirting until they fall asleep.
In the dead of night, you hear a loud voice saying: "Here comes the groom! Come out and meet him!"
They woke up all the bachelors and found their condoms.
The wise women said to the foolish ones: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
But the wise ones answered them and said, "It may not be enough for us and you; go buy it from those who sell it."
And when they were going to buy oil, the groom came, and they went in with him to the wedding place, and the door was locked.
And then the bachelors returned to the others and said: "Oh sir, oh sir, unlock us! Luke"
But the groom answered them and said: "In truth, I don't know you."
They are only heedless of the Hour, which (cometh) as a thief in the night. [Chapter 46, Verse 15] The last part of this verse is missing in many ancient manuscripts.
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who went on a journey, and called his servants and entrusted his property to them. Luke" An example of the parable of the talents of money.
And he gave five talents of money to one, two to another, and one to the third, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
And the one who took five coins began to buy and sell with them, and he gained five more coins.
And that's what took two boxes, also won two more boxes.
As for that one who took one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the bag his master had given him.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves returned and settled accounts with them.
He comes to him with five dirhams and pays him another five dirhams, and says: "You gave me five dirhams, so here are the other five dirhams I won in addition."
His mistress said to him, "I have nothing to ask of you; you are a good and faithful slave! You have been faithful to me in little things, and now I will trust you with greater. Come, then, and rejoice with your master."
And then, the one who had received two fish also came and said, "Sir, you gave me two fish, and here are two more that I caught."
His mistress said to him, "I have nothing to ask of you, you are a good and faithful servant! You have been faithful to me in little things, and now I will entrust you with much. Come, therefore, and rejoice with your master."
And after that, the one who had taken a bundle came to him and said, "Master, I know that you are a hard man, reaping what you have not sown and gathering what you have not scattered."
Out of fear, I went and buried your treasure in the ground, and here is your reward.
His master answered him and said, "You are a wicked and lazy slave! Now you know that I reap what I did not sow and gather what I did not winnow?"
Yes, you should have invested my money with the money traders, so that when I return, I can take it back with its profits.
Take this bag away from him and add it to the ten bags that he already has.
Wherever anyone had something, it was taken from them and more than they could bear was added to their burden. And those who had nothing, even what they did have was taken away from them. When?
"This servant, who did not forgive his fellow, will be thrown outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 8:12, 22:13; Luke 13:28 "The Son of Man will judge the nations."
"And when the son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory."
And all the peoples of the earth will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats,
He leads the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
And then the king said to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world."
When I was hungry, you gave me food, when I was thirsty, you gave me drink, when I was a stranger, you welcomed me.
"I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me."
The clock's hands will answer those who do good deeds and say: "O Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a drink?"
And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you? Or naked and clothe you?
When did we ever see you sick or in prison and come to you?
And the king will answer them and say to them: "I tell you the truth: every time you have done this to one of these little brothers of mine, you have done it to me!"
And say to those on his left: "Go away from me, you accursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels."
When I was hungry, you did not feed me, and when I was thirsty, you did not give me a drink.
And I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not come to me.
And then the hour will come when they will be asked, "Lord! When did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not help you?"
And the king answered them and said, "You speak the truth. For you have not done this deed for those who are least among you, you have done it for me."
Those who have chosen evil will go to eternal suffering, and those who have done the will of God will go to eternal life.
Chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew describes
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
You know that in two days' time it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
And while the time was being wasted, the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the court of Caiaphas, the high priest,
And they consulted together how they might take Jesus by trickery and kill Him.
But they said, "We should not do this on the festival, or there may be a riot among the people." It was the woman who poured the perfume on Jesus.
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman had an expensive perfume bottle, and she poured it all over his head while he was sitting next to the food table.
When his students saw what she had done, they were displeased and said to him, "Why this waste?"
Since this scent could be sold at a high price, its value would be distributed to the poor.
When Jesus learned what they were discussing, he asked, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me.
"For the poor will always be with you, but I will not always be with you."
And when they smelled this scent on my clothes, they smelled it to prepare me for burial.
I'll tell you the truth: wherever they proclaim this good news in the whole world, what this woman has done will be spoken of and remembered." Judas the traitor agreed to hand Jesus over.
And so, one of the disciples, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
He said to them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you?" And they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas was watching for an opportunity to hand Jesus over. It was during the celebration of the Passover meal with his disciples.
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
And he answered them and said, "Go to the city to such a one, and say to him, 'The Master says, "My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
And when the evening came, Jesus sat down with the twelve disciples to eat.
As they were eating, he said to them, "Truly I tell you, one of you will hand me over."
The students were very sad and each one began to ask: "Is it me, Sir?"
He answered them and said, "He who is with me has his hand in the dish, it is he who will betray me!"
"Man was born to die, as written in the Book of God, but woe to the man who delivers the son of man, it would have been better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas, one of the Twelve, who approached Jesus and asked, "Teacher, is it I?" Jesus replied, "You have said so." (The Last Supper)
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
And after God, the cup, and thanks to God, and gave them and said: "Drink from it all of you,"
For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And we say to you: From today, I will not drink this grape juice again until the day comes when I drink it with you anew in the kingdom of Ba.
And after they praised God, they went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This very night all of you will fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." (Matthew 26:32)
And Peter answered him and said, "Though all may desert you, I will never desert you!"
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
And Peter answered him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the disciples said the same thing. Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."
And after that, He was accompanied by Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and He began to feel sorrowful and distressed.
He said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and keep watch with me!"
And then he waited a bit, prostrated himself, and began to pray, saying: "Oh Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from me; not as I will, but as you will."
And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and vigilant, lest you fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
He walked for the second time, prayed, and said: "Oh Father! If this trial cannot pass me by without me experiencing it, then let Your will be done."
And he returned and found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
He left them again and prayed for the third time, repeating the same words.
From now on, he went to his disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of sinners,
Let's go! Here comes the one who is going to baptize me." Jesus was moved.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And the one who handed him over gave them a sign and said to them, "The man you are going to kiss, that's him. Seize him!"
Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where are you going?" He replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me later."
And Jesus said to him, "Why have you come, friend?" Then they came near to Jesus and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away! For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
And you think that I can't call my father right now and have him send me more than a dozen angelic military units?
But how can the words in the Book of God, which say that this is how it should be, come true?
And Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders, who had come for him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not try to seize me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness." Luke 22:52-53
But all this happened so that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then the disciples all left him and fled. Jesus before the Jewish court.
But those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
And Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the servants to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and the elders of the people sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
But they found nothing, even though many false witnesses came forward. In the end, two witnesses testified.
And they say: "This man said, 'I am able to rebuild the House of God and I will finish it in three days.'" - John
And the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer anything to what these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest then said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
And Jesus answered him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
And at that hour the chief of the priests gathered his belongings and said, "This is blasphemy! We no longer need witnesses, for you yourselves have heard his words of blasphemy."
"Eva aach ban likom?" They answered him, saying, "He deserves to die!"
They spat in his face, hit him, and some of them slapped him.
And they said, "Tell us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter denied Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard, in the garden, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee!"
He denied in front of everyone and said, "I don't know what you're talking about!"
And afterward he went to the door of the house, and another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, "This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied again, and swore, saying, "I do not know this man!"
And after a while, those who were standing said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for your speech gives you away!"
And he started cursing and swearing, saying, "I don't even know this man!" Then the rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Chapter twenty-seven
And early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to a decision about Jesus to put him to death.
And they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. Judas Iscariot went and hanged himself.
And when he saw Judas who betrayed him, he said, "O Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" And
I said to them, "I'm innocent because I didn't do anything wrong." They said to me, "Not our problem, sort it out yourself."
And Judah threw the thirty pieces of silver into the house of the Lord, and then went away and hanged himself.
And they took the silver from the religious leaders and said, "It is not permissible to put it in the treasury of the House of God, for it is the price of human blood."
They agreed to buy a plot of land in El Fakhari and turn it into a cemetery for foreigners.
That's why people still call this field the Field of Blood to this day.
And at that moment what the Lord had revealed to the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said, "They gave thirty pieces of silver, the price at which some of the Israelites had agreed to pay.
"With this money buy a potter's field, as I have been commanded by the Lord." Jesus before Pontius Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor, who asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said so."
And when the heads of the religious scholars and the elders accused him, he did not answer them at all.
Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
And Jesus gave him no answer, not even a word. This amazed the governor greatly.
It was the governor's custom at the festival to release to the crowd any one prisoner whom they asked for.
At that time they had in prison a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
When the people were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release to you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
When Pilate knew that they were jealous of Jesus, he brought him forth.
Now while Pilate was sitting on his judgment seat, his wife sent him a message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal in a dream because of him.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask Pilate to release Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
Then Pilate asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They answered, "Barabbas."
And Pilate said unto them, "What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him!"
He said to them, "What evil have I done?" But they increased in their aggression and said to him, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your responsibility."
The entire people answered him, saying: "Just leave his blood on us and our children!"
And you, at that hour, released Barabbas to them, but delivered Jesus, after they had scourged Him, to be crucified. The soldiers also mocked Jesus.
And the soldiers of the governor led Jesus into the governor's palace, and gathered the whole battalion together against him.
They dressed him in a red cloak.
They twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
They attacked him, took the cane, and hit him on the head with it.
And after they had mocked him, they took off his cloak and put his clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified. Jesus is being crucified.
And as they led him out of the city, they met a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry his cross.
And they came to the place which is called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
And they gave him wine mixed with a herb called "marjoram," but when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
They crucified him and divided his belongings among themselves after they cast lots for them.
And they remained silent, then they whispered about him.
And they placed above his head a notice in three languages—Hebrew, Latin, and Greek—which read, "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
And then they crucified him with two thieves, one on his right and the other on his left.
And the people who passed by used to mock him while they turned their heads away.
They said, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross, and we will believe in you." (Matthew 27:42)
And the heads of the religious scholars, the legal scholars, and the elders would also laugh at him and say:
"Others were saved, but he could not save himself! If he were the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!"
"Alright, rely on God! Let him go free now if he wants to, since he says: 'I am God's son!'"
Even the thieves who were crucified with him reviled him like the others. The death of Jesus.
And darkness fell upon the whole land from noon until three in the afternoon.
Around three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
And they heard some of those who were standing there say, "He is calling Elijah."
One of them ran and grabbed a piece of cloth, soaked it in vinegar, placed it on the head of a reed, and offered it to him to drink.
And they said to each other, "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come and save him!"
And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and died.
The raw walls of the house of God cracked in two, from top to bottom. The earth trembled and the rock split.
And the graves are adorned and followed by many people who are sanctified from death.
And those who had fallen asleep in death came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection, entered the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.
When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
And there were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. Luke
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebed's children. Jesus' tomb
That evening, a man named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came. He was dressed in a linen garment.
And this man entered and went up to Pilate, and asked him to give him the body of Jesus. And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And God clothed Joseph with a garment of fine linen,
And he laid it in the new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
And the next day, after the day they prepared for the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,
I said to him, "You remind us, Sir, that when that liar was alive, he used to say that after three days he would return. When?"
"Yes, give your order for the guard to remain at the tomb until the third day, so that the disciples don't come at night and steal it and then tell the people: 'He has risen from the dead!' And this last lie will be even worse than the first one."
And Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
And they went to the room of the tomb, lit a candle, and locked the door.
Chapter twenty-eight: Jesus rises from the dead.
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb at the beginning of the week, as the first light of dawn was breaking.
Suddenly, a powerful earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven, approached, and rolled back the stone at the entrance of the tomb, and sat on it.
His complexion was like lightning, and his garments were white as snow.
The soldiers trembled with fear and became still like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified,
Our path isn't here, because he followed the path of death, as they say. Come and see the place where he was laid to rest.
And they went quickly and told his disciples, saying, "He has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him." Behold, I have told you.
And the women came out of the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
And Jesus met them unexpectedly and said to them, "Peace be upon you!" They came up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." So the soldiers went and spread the word among the Jews.
And when the women were on their way, some of the guards of the tomb went into the city and informed the chief priests of everything that had happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted about this matter. They bribed the soldiers with a lot of money.
I said to them, "Say that the students came at night and stole it while we were sleeping."
"Otherwise, the governor will cut off the water supply. We will convince him; he won't let you down."
And they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus entrusted his disciples...
As for the disciples, they went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go, Matthew 28:16.
And when they saw him, they prostrated before him, but some of them were averse (to doing so).
And Jesus came near and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth,
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." - Matthew 28:19 (New International Version)
"And teach them to do all that I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all days, even to the end of the age."
Chapter one: John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus.
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
A voice in the desert cries out: "Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way."
"This is how John came to the wilderness, baptizing people and telling them about the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 'Prepare the way of the Lord,' he said, 'and make his paths straight.'"
And people came out to him from all the region of Judea and from Jerusalem, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
John wore clothes made of camel hair, fastened with a leather belt, and ate locusts and wild honey.
He used to tell people and say, "One will come after me who is stronger than me, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." John baptized Jesus.
"And Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli, of the lineage of Nathan, of the sons of David; from Nazareth, a city in Galilee, was baptized by John in the Jordan."
And behold, the hour came when he came out of the water, and the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 The devil tempted Jesus.
"And so, the Spirit of God, Jesus, went out into the desert."
And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
And he said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel." Mark 1:15 (Jesus chooses His first disciples)
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And at that moment, they left their window and followed him.
And he added a little, and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat mending their nets.
And Jesus called them, and they immediately left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him. Jesus healed a man who was possessed by a demon.
And they went to Capernaum. And immediately on the Sabbath day, Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
And the people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes of the law. When?
In the mosque, a man was possessed by a jinn, and he started screaming.
And they said, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
And Jesus rebuked the demon, saying, "Be silent and come out of him!"
The jinn threw the man to the ground and he began to roll around, and the jinn struggled with great effort and emerged from him.
And all the people were amazed, and they began to ask each other, "What is this? Is this a new teaching with authority? Even the insane obey him when he commands them!"
The news about Jesus spread throughout all Galilee. He was healing many people, including Peter's mother-in-law and many others.
And Jesus went out with his disciples, James and John, from the house of prayer, and they were walking to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Nasaiba Samaan was lying in bed because she had a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
He approached her, grabbed her hand, and she stood up. The warmth emanated from her, enveloping them both.
That evening, as the sun was setting, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed.
All the people of the city were gathered by the gate.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him. Jesus was teaching.
And Jesus went out a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed.
And Simon and those who were with him began to search for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
And he said unto them, "Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for therefore came I forth."
And he went about preaching the gospel, and healing all disease and sickness among the people. Mark 1:39; 6:12-13 Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
Then a man with leprosy came to Jesus, pleading on his knees: "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
He sighed, stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, "I want you to be pure."
And at that moment, the pigs left him and he became pure.
And Jesus commanded him strictly not to tell anyone, but to go and show himself to the priest, and make an offering for his cleansing, as a testimony to them.
"Be careful not to say anything to anyone! But go and show yourself to the priest and do what Moses commanded for your cleansing, so it will be a testimony to them."
But that man went out and began to tell everyone about what had happened. So, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but stayed in secluded places. Nevertheless, people came to him from all directions.
Chapter 2: Jesus Heals a Paralytic
And after some days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and it was heard that He was in the house.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no space left in front of the door. And he began to teach them the word of God.
And they brought him a paralyzed man carried by four men.
And when they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof above where He was. Then, they lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying through the opening.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
And they were sitting with some scholars of the law, and they said to themselves:
"Why is this man speaking like this, uttering words of blasphemy? Who can forgive sins besides God alone?"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain such thoughts in your hearts?"
It's not easy; you tell the paralyzed person, "Your sins are forgiven," but would you tell him, "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk"?
But you must know this: the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
I'll tell you: Get up, pack your bags, and go home!
And the man stood up and shook his mat and went out before the people. And they were all amazed, and they gave glory to God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose to do this at a specific time.
And again Jesus came to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and a crowd of people came to him and began to be taught by him.
And when he came to the other side, he saw a man named Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
While Jesus was dining at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners ate with him and his disciples, for many were following him.
When the Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard them and said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The question about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to Jesus, "Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus answered them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the groom will be chosen from among them, and on that day they will fast.
Not even one would mend an old garment with a piece of new cloth, because if they did, the new patch would shrink and the tear would only get bigger.
No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The new wine would burst the old skins, and both the wine and the wineskins would be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. Jesus was teaching about the Sabbath.
And on the seventh day, Saturday #2:23, which is the day of rest and worship for the Jews.
Then the Pharisees went and asked him, "Why do your disciples do what is unlawful on the Sabbath?" Jesus answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests." Jesus went on to say, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
"And how did he enter the House of God when Abiatar, who was the chief of the priests, offered the bread that was presented to God, which no one was supposed to eat except the priests alone, and he even gave some of it to the men who were with him?"
He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"Where man was born, God is even the Lord of the Sabbath."
Chapter three: Jesus heals on the Sabbath
Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man there with a paralyzed hand.
And the Pharisees were watching Jesus, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.
Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stand up and come forward!"
And he said to the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill?" But they were silent.
He looked at them with anger and felt deeply saddened by their hardness of heart. He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched out his hand, and it was restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus, for many were following him.
And Jesus went out with his disciples by the side of the Sea of Galilee, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea.
From Jerusalem and Judea and from the other side of the Jordan and from the region around Tyre and Sidon, a great many people came to Jesus, because they had heard about all the things he was doing.
He told his disciples to get him a boat so that people would not crowd around him, Mark.
When he had healed many of them, all the sick people began to crowd around him, wanting to touch him.
And those who were possessed by demons fell down before him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them, charging them strictly not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus chooses the twelve apostles.
And he went up into the mountain, and called unto him those whom he would, and they came unto him.
And He chose twelve of them to be His companions and to send them out to preach the good news,
And they have the power to release the insane.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter),
And James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, to whom Jesus gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,
And Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebul.
After that, Jesus went to a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.
When Jesus' family heard about this, they came to take him home, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out demons." Mark
Jesus called the scribes and Pharisees to him and said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
"A kingdom that is divided and has its people fighting each other will not be able to remain stable."
Otherwise, a family that divides and starts to fight among themselves, that family won't be able to remain stable.
