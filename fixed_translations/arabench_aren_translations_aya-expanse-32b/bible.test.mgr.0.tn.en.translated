Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them.
He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Someone who accepts a little boy like that, because my name accepts me.
But as for those who cause dissension among the children of Adam, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, there will be a chain of iron around their necks. They will be cast into the heart of the Fire.
Alas for the world and the things that make people commit sins! Those things must come, but woe to the person who brings the things that make people commit sins!
If your hand or your leg makes you sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better to enter eternal life with a crippled hand or leg than to be thrown into eternal fire with both hands and legs intact.
"If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two eyes." (Luke 15:3-7)
"Be careful not to despise any of these children. I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
# 18:11 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "I am the Son of Man, come to save the lost."
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountainside and go to look for the one that is lost?
"Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, he will celebrate more over this one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not wander astray."
"Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for you. (Luke 17:29)" Note: The original Arabic text seems to be a mix of modern Arabic and Quranic/classical Arabic, and the translation provided is an interpretation of the intended meaning. The specific verse reference given (Luke 17:3) does not match the content of the Arabic text, which aligns more closely with Luke 17:29.
"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over."
But if he will not listen to you, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses.
If he doesn't want to listen to them, tell the church, and if he doesn't want to listen to the church, consider him as an unbeliever or a hypocrite.
I tell you the truth: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Here is the translation: "I tell you again: if two of you agree on anything they ask on earth, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven."
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
At that time Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
That's why the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who settles accounts with his servants.
He started holding them accountable, so he brought in someone to ask for money without limit.
As the debt mounted, he ordered that he, his wife, his children, and all his possessions be sold to pay off his debts.
My brother fell to his knees and said, "My lord, my lord, be patient with me and I will repay you everything!"
His master mocked him, forgave him, and waived the debt.
As that servant was about to leave, he met another servant like him and asked him for some money. The latter strangled him and said, "Pay me the money you asked from me!"
My friend, the other servant fell on his knees, begged him and said: "Be patient with me, I will pay you back soon."
And he didn't like it, so he left and they put him in prison until he pays off the debt he owes.
The other servants found out what had happened, became very worried, and went to inform their master that everything had been discovered.
At that time, he called his master and said, "O evil servant! I have forgiven you all that debt because you pleaded with me."
"And you, you have no right to show mercy to your servant friend as I have shown mercy to you?"
And deceive your master, and hand him over to the prison official until he pays off his entire debt.
This is how the Father in heaven will do to each one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus finished speaking, he left the region of Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Many people followed him, and the one who was going ahead healed them.
Then the Pharisees went and asked him a question to test him. They said, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Reply to them: "Didn't you read that He who created them in the beginning created them as female and male?"
# Genesis 1:27; 2:24; Ephesians 5:31; 1 Corinthians 6:16 He said, "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh."
"They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."
The Pharisees said to him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife? for what cause?"
Jesus said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts, but from the beginning it was not so.
And I tell you: any man who divorces his wife for any reason other than adultery and marries another woman is committing adultery.
The students said, "If this is the case with a man and his wife, it's better for him not to get married."
As he told them: "Not everyone will accept these words, but only those whom God allows to accept them."
"There are some who are unable to marry from the moment they are born, and there are others whom people have made such that they are unable to marry, and there are those who do not wish to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let whoever can do this, do so." - Jesus Blessing the Little Children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
They brought little children to Jesus, to lay hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked the people.
As Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he laid his hands on them, and departed from that place. The rich man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
One man ran up to him and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
# Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20 They said, "What are the commandments?" Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
# 19:18 Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The boy said, "I can do all these things, what else am I missing?"
Jesus said: "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell all you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me!"
Upon hearing this, the boy walked sadly, as he had possessed many things.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised and said, "So who can be saved?"
But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
At that time, Peter answered and said to Him, "Behold, we have left all and followed You; therefore what shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever forsakes homes and brothers and sisters and father and mother and children and lands for the sake of my name, will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life.
"Many people who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last."
Like the servants of the grapevine owner.
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
And he made an agreement with the workers for a denarius per day, and sent them into his vineyard.
And he went out with the nine, then he saw another group standing in the market, idle.
He told them, "You too, go to the vineyard, and I will give you what is right, and they went."
And he went out again about noon, and about three in the afternoon he did the same thing.
And he went out about the fifth hour in the evening, and found others sitting there, and said to them, "Why are you sitting here idle all day?"
They told him, "No one called us to work." He said to them, "You too, go work in the vineyard."
In the evening, the grape owner said to the one who was busy with the servants: "Call the servants and set them free, starting with the two youngest until you reach the governor."
And the group that started working with the five in the evening, each of them received a silver penny.
When the rulers came, they thought they would take more than the others, but each of them received a silver coin.
And when they finish, they cheat the grape seller.
They said, "These two worked for only an hour, and you paid them the same as us who worked all day in the heat!"
But one of them answered, "My friend, I have not wronged you. Didn't we agree on a silver coin?
Take what's rightfully yours and go. I wanted to give this to the others just as much as I'm giving it to you.
"Bro, don't I have the right to spend my money however I want? Or are you jealous because I'm generous?"
Jesus said, "The first will be last, and the last will be first." Jesus predicts his death and resurrection for the third time (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34)
As they were going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside privately and said to them on the way,
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews; and they will condemn Him to death."
"And they will hand me over to the Gentiles, and they will mock me and scourge me and crucify me, and on the third day I will rise again." This is what the mother of James and John asked for (Mark 10:35-45).
And once a woman came to him with her children, she prostrated before him and asked him for something.
Jesus said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to him, "Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Then Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
He said to them, "You will drink from my cup, but I am not the one who decides who will sit at my right hand and at my left. It is my father who has prepared places for these people."
When the other ten disciples heard this, they became indignant with the two brothers.
Just as Jesus called them, he said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.
But you should not have that among you. Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant.
"And whoever among you wants to be first, let him be a servant to all."
"Even from me, the Son of Man, people did not come to be served, but to serve and give my life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
My brother, people shouted at them to be quiet. But they shouted even more: "Our Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him: "Sir, we would like to go back and see!"
And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately they received their sight, and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
And he said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone tells you anything, respond to them: "The Lord requires it of them." And He will repay them in due time.
This thing happened just as the prophet said it would.
# Isaiah 62:11; Zechariah 9:9 "Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you; He is humble, and mounted on a donkey, And on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus mounted.
And most of the people spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
# Mark 11:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39 and the people who went before him and those who followed shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And as Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and they asked, "Who is this?"
And the people said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the money-changers from the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
# Mk 5:7, 11 And he said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of thieves!"
And the blind and the lame came to the temple, and he healed them.
But the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews were incensed when they saw the wonders that Jesus did, and how the little children were crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
# Mark 8:2 And they were asking him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And when he returned to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
And he saw a vine by the wayside, and he went and dug it up, and found only leaves on it, and said to it, "May you never bear fruit again forever!" And the vine withered at once.
The students were amazed at what had happened and said, "Why did the vine wither at that moment?"
And Jesus answered them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will be done.
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." - The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
As Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question; and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
"Where does John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" So they argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But if we say, "From the people," they will be afraid of the people, because they are all certain that John is a prophet.
And they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." Just like the two sons.
What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go work today in the vineyard."
My brother answered his son: "I'm not going." But later, he regretted it and went.
And the other lad walked and said the same thing the first lad said, and he answered them: "Here I am, sir!" But he did not go.
"Who is the one who does what his father loves?" The teachers said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
"But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed in him. Even when you saw this, you did not repent and believe in him." (Just like the tenants of the vineyard - Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
Hear another parable: A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country.
As the time for the grape harvest approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the crop.
And they bound his five servants and beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another with stones.
The grape master sent his servants again, more numerous than the first time, but they did the same thing to them.
He separated their children and said, "They are my children."
But when the five saw the boy, they said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They tied him up, dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"What will the owner of the vineyard do with those five goats when he comes?"
The Jewish elders said, "So that he may kill those evil ones and give the vineyard to five others who will give him the grape harvest at its time."
# Psalm 118:22-23; Isaiah 4:11; 1 Peter 2:7 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
That's why I tell you: The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field; it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.
# 21:44 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "I am the Son of Man who came to save the lost."
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized he was talking about them.
As they tried to seize him, they were afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.
Like the parable of the great banquet (Luke 14:15-24)
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they did not come.
And he sent other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast!'"
But they didn't account for the night shift and went their own ways; one went to his farm, and one went to his shop.
And others seized his servants and mistreated them and killed them.
The king was deceived, sent his soldiers, killed those criminals, and burned their city.
And he said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy."
"Either go to the streets and invite as many people as you can to the wedding party."
And those servants went out into the streets and brought in all the good and bad people they could find, so the wedding hall was filled with guests.
But when the king came to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing proper clothes. So he said:
"How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man fell silent.
At that time, the king said to the servants, "Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26) - Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
At that time the Pharisees went out and plotted together how they might entrap Jesus in his words.
And they sent their disciples to him, along with some of Herod's men, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't show partiality to anyone, because you pay no attention to a person's status.
He said: "What do you think? Is it right that we should pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
But Jesus, aware of their wickedness, said to them, "You hypocrites! Why are you testing me?"
Show me the tax money!" He handed him a silver penny.
Jesus asked them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"
They said, "The emperor's things!" My brother said to them, "Well then, give the emperor's things to the emperor, and God's things to God!"
And they were amazed when they heard him say this, and they left him and went away. The Resurrection of the Dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
On that day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection after death, came to Jesus and asked him a question.
Deuteronomy 25:5 They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man dies and has no children, his brother shall take the wife and raise up children for his brother.'
There were seven brothers among us, and the eldest got married but died without having children, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh one.
And after them all, the woman died.
"On the Day of Judgment, that woman will be the wife of all of them, because she married them all."
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, because you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God.
On the Day of Judgment, they will neither marry nor be married, but they will be like the angels in heaven.
It is as if you are rising from the dead. Didn't you read what God said to you?
# Mark 12:26-27 (Arabic to English): "Have you not read, in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."
And when the people heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
Now when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they gathered themselves together.
And one of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test him:
Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
Jesus answered him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." - Matthew 6:5 (Aramaic to English translation)
This is the first and greatest commandment.
# Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 19:19; Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:9; James 2:8 and the second commandment, "Love your neighbor as yourself."
"The whole Law and the prophets depend on these two commandments." - Jesus and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
And while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
"What is your opinion about Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David!"
He said to them, "How then did David call him 'Lord' when he was in the flesh and said,
# Psalm 110:1; Isaiah 2:34-35; Hebrews 1:13; 10:13 The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool."
"If David calls him 'Lord,' how can his son be?"
Not even one person could answer him with a word. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus warns against the scribes and Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
Then Jesus said to the people and to his disciples,
The translation of the provided text from Arabic to English is: "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,"
Just do as they say and memorize everything they tell you. But don't do as they do, because they say one thing and do another.
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, but they wouldn't touch it with their little finger.
They do all these things so that people can see them, they grow in their turbans and lengthen the hems of their clothes,
They love to sit in the front rows at soirées and in the front seats at assemblies.
People like to greet them in the markets and call them: "Teachers!"
But you should not let anyone address you as "teachers," for you have only one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'Father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
And do not let anyone tell you, "My lord," for you have one Lord, who is Christ.
And let your elder serve you.
What goes up must come down, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
# 23:14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when one becomes a disciple, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe to you, blind leaders! You say, "Whoever swears by the temple is not bound by their oath; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by their oath."
Who has more value, O ignorant and blind ones? Is it the gold or the temple that made the gold sacred?
And they shall say, "He who swears by the altar is bound by nothing, but he who swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by his oath."
"Anna huwa alladhi 'indahu qimma akthar, ya 'umyan? Al-qurbān walā al-mizbah allatī tirdu al-qurbān muqaddas?" Translation: "Which one has more value, O blind ones? The sacrifice or the altar that makes the sacrifice holy?"
"If someone swears by the altar, they are swearing by it and everything above it!"
"And whoever swears by the Temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it."
"And he who swears by the sky, swears by the throne and by Allah who sits upon it."
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
And you, too, appear to people as righteous on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore, behold, I
And you say, "We were present in the time of our ancestors, but we did not participate in the killing of the prophets."
Here you are bearing witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
"Then you are the ones who have upset the balance of your ancestors."
Oh sons of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of hell's punishment?
That is why I send you prophets, wise men, and scriptures. Some of them you kill and crucify, and some you scourge in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
Surely all the blood of innocent Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar, will come upon this generation. (Translation note: The input text appears to be a combination of Arabic and a style similar to biblical references, mixing numbers and abbreviations for books of the Bible. The translation provided interprets the numbers and abbreviations to match the corresponding books in the English Bible.)
"I tell you, this generation will be held accountable for the blood of all the prophets shed since the beginning of the world; from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, it will be charged against this generation." Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."
Hey, leave it alone or it'll be ruined for you.
I say to you: You will not see me again until the time comes when you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Jesus speaks of the fall of the temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus went out of the temple. And as he was going, his disciples came to him and showed him the buildings of the temple.
My brother said to them, "Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." Disaster and Persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Beware, lest anyone deceive you.
Many people will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be afraid. These things must happen, but it is not the end."
"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in many places."
This is all just the first of the birth pangs.
And at that time they will take you as prisoners to torment you, and all nations will hate you because of my name.
And at that time many people will stop being believers, and they will betray and hate each other.
Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
And most of the people will no longer have love, because evil will increase.
But what proves to others that he will pay.
"And the gospel of the kingdom of God will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." (Mark 13:14-23; Luke 21:20-24)
# 9:27, 11:31, 12:11 "Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week he shall bring sacrifices and offerings to cease, and on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolator." (For those who read to understand).
At that time, they made the Jews flee to the mountains.
And leave what's on the roof; don't bring it down to the ground to take the things in the house.
And don't let the one in the cart go back to get his coat.
Woe to the pregnant women and the nursing ones in those days.
Ask your Lord for forgiveness, and then repent to Him. He will send [upon you] abundant [rain] from the sky.
Because at that time there will be a great scarcity, the like of which has not been seen since the beginning of the world until now.
And if God had not shortened the days, no soul would have survived. But He gives respite to those who choose to believe.
At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, he is over there!' do not believe it!
Beware, for many will come in the likeness of the Antichrist and false prophets, performing great deeds and wonders to deceive, even the elect, if possible.
Hani warned you before.
But if they say to you, 'Look, there is the Christ in the desert!' do not go out; if they say, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it!
Just as lightning flashes from east to west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
"Wherever the carcass is, there the vultures will gather." - Jesus, Son of Man (Mark 13:24-27; Luke 21:25-28)
# Isaiah 8:12; Isaiah 13:10; Ezekiel 32:7; Joel 2:10-11; Zephaniah 1:15 "At that time, when distress comes, the sun will turn dark and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken."
"Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
"And then I will send my angels, and they will sound their trumpets with a loud voice, and they will gather my chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens." (Gospel of Mark 13:28-31; Gospel of Luke 21:29-33)
Take the vine as an example: as soon as its branches turn green and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near.
And as you also see these things happening, you know that I am near the door.
To put it plainly: This generation won't amount to much until all these things happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Keep watching and be ready" (Mark 13:32-37; Luke 17:26-30; 12:39-40).
"But that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also with the coming of the Son of Man.
Just as people did in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until Noah entered the ark.
And they knew nothing until the floods came and swept them all away. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
At that time, there were two men in the cart, one was moving and the other was staying still.
Two women were sitting on the mill, grinding wheat, one swaying and the other remaining still.
Wake up, you don't know the day your Lord will come.
As they knew this, the homeowner knew when the thieves would break in, so he stayed up all night and didn't let his house get robbed.
That's why you too must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you least expect him." (Luke 12:41-48)
Who is the trustworthy servant who knows how to behave, is like a master in his own right, and takes care of everything so that he can provide their food at the right time?
"How fitting it is that the servant returns to his master and finds that he has served him well."
To be honest with you, they are going to eat up all his property.
But if this servant turned out to be evil and said to himself, "My master will return late."
And he began to beat the other servants and to eat and drink with the drunkards.
Sido will return on a day he doesn't expect and at an hour he doesn't know.
"They will be cut up and placed in the spot where the hypocrites are heading. That's where the crying and the regrets will be."
Like the girls.
"The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were ignorant, and five knew how to behave.
When the ignorant people shook their lanterns, they did not shake the oil with them.
But those who knew how to behave, carried their oil lamps with them.
And like the bridegroom, they were all overcome by sleep and lay down.
But at midnight they heard a shout: "The bridegroom is coming! Go out to meet him!"
My brother, all the girls stood up and lit their lanterns.
And the fools said to those who knew how to act: "Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out."
Those who knew how to behave replied: "It might not be enough for us and you, go to the oil sellers and buy what you need."
And when they were about to start shopping, the groom arrived. The guests entered the house with him, and the door was closed.
And then the other girls came closer, too, and said to the groom: "Our master, our master, open the door for us!"
But he answered them, "You are wrong; I do not know you."
"Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." (Luke 19:11-27)
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who wanted to travel, so he called his servants and gave them his money."
He gave to each according to his ability; to one he gave five talents of gold, to another two talents, and to another one talent, and then he went on a journey.
The one who took the five bags walked quickly and traded them, and then he made a profit of five more bags.
And he took two more bags, and won two more bags.
But the one who took one bag went away, dug in the ground, and hid his master's money.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, "Master, you entrusted me with five talents. Here I have made five more talents."
My master said: "Well done, my faithful and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy with a little, so here is much for you. Enter into the joy of your master."
And he took the two purses, and said, "Master, you gave me two purses, and behold, I have gained two more."
My master said: "Well done, my faithful, good, and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy in little; I will appoint you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
"But this one, he also came with a bundle, and said: 'My lord, I know that you are a harsh man, reaping what you did not sow and gathering what you did not plant."
"I was scared, so I ran away and buried your money in the ground. Here it is."
But the servant replied: "Master, are you calling me lazy or evil or stingy? How can I harvest what I did not sow, or gather what I did not plant?
You should have put my money in the bank, and we would have taken it back with interest.
And he said to his servants, Take the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.
He who has will be given more, and he will have abundance. But he who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
"As for the servant who is of no use, throw him out into the darkness. Where will be the weeping and gnashing of teeth."» Judgment Day

We put the sheep on my right and the goats on my left.
And then I will say to those on my right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world,
"Because I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me."
"I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was bound and you came to me."
At that time, the righteous will answer Him: "Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?
And when did we see you a stranger and shelter you? Or naked and clothe you?
"And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?"
And I, the king, will answer them: "Every time you did that thing to one of my younger brothers, you did it to me!"
And then I will say to those on my left: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:"
I was hungry and you did not feed me, I was thirsty and you did not give me a drink.
"And I was a stranger and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and bound and you did not visit me."
And they will also answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not help you?"
And I would answer them: "Every time you tell me I didn't do something, you didn't do it with one of my younger siblings either, you didn't do it with me."
"And they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous will go to eternal life."
The Jews were trying to kill Jesus. (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53)
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples:
"You know that the Passover is in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
At that time, the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the court of Caiaphas, the high priest,
And they plotted together to entrap Jesus by trickery and kill Him.
As they said: "What was not sought after on the feast day, so as not to become a stumbling block in the midst of the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to me with an expensive perfume bottle in her hand, and she poured it over his head while he was eating.
But when the students saw it, they said, "Why this waste?"
This perfume used to be sold for a lot of money, and it was given to the poor!
Jesus, realizing what had happened, said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me.
The poor will always be with you, but I will not always be with you.
And if she poured perfume on my body, she would be preparing me for the grave.
"Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." - Betrayal of Judas (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
At that time, one of the twelve disciples, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
# Mark 10:32; Matthew 26:15 And he said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
And as soon as it was night, he began to wait for an opportunity to betray him. The Passover meal with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you to eat?"
He said to them, "Go and tell the people in the city, 'The teacher says: My time has come, for me to eat the Passover meal in your house with my disciples.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
In the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his twelve disciples.
And while they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
And they were very sad, and began to say to him one by one: "Is it I, Lord?"
Reply to them: "The one who puts his hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me.
# Mk 4:9 He told them, “Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.”
Judas, who betrayed him, asked: "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered: "You have said so." The Lord's Supper (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
And he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
We tell you: "We will no longer drink this grape juice, until that day comes when we drink it with you anew in the kingdom of our Father."
After singing hymns, they went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus told Peter that he would deny him. (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38)
# John 13:7; John 16:32 Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me tonight. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
But after we rise from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee."
My brother, Peter said: "Even if they all leave you, I will never leave you."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)
Then Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And Peter and the two sons of Zebedee followed him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
At that time he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake."
And then he went a little further, fell on his knees, and prayed, "Father, if it is possible, take this cup away from me. But not what I want, but what you want."
And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "So, could you not keep watch with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray, lest you be tried. The soul wants to remain vigilant, but the body is weak.
And again he went away and prayed, saying, "Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me unless I drink it, your will be done, not mine."
And he came again, and found them sleeping again; for their eyes were heavy.
He left them again and went away to pray for the third time, and once more he spoke to them.
Then Jesus came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up, let's go! Here comes my betrayer." And Jesus (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12)
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he gave them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, that is the one; seize him!"
And as he walked, some went ahead to Jesus and greeted him, saying, "Hail, Master!" and kissed him.
Jesus said, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
At that moment Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
"You don't think that I can't ask Dad, when he sends me more than a hundred thousand angels as an army?"
"But how can the sacred books that say this thing must happen be fulfilled?"
Jesus said to the people, "You came out to arrest me with swords and clubs, as if I were a criminal. Every day I was teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me.
"And that very hour the whole matter was fulfilled that was spoken by the prophets. Then the disciples forsook him and fled." Jesus before the Jewish council (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24)
And they bound Jesus, and led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders of the Jews were assembled.
And Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest's residence. He went inside and sat with the guards, to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and all the council sought for false witness against Jesus, to put him to death.
But they couldn't find a way, even though many people came forward and testified falsely. Later, two witnesses came forward.
And they said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
And the chief priest stood up and said, "Are you not going to answer? Do you not hear what these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
The top one among the heads of the priests, Debashu, said: "It is apostasy! Do we still need witnesses? You just heard him say it as apostasy.
"What sentence do you give him?" They answered, "He must die!"
They spat on him and struck him with their palms, and some of them even hit him.
And they said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
At that time Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean!"
But he denied before them all, saying, "I do not understand what you mean."
And when he went out to the outer gate, another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied again, swearing and saying, "I do not know this man!"
Stepping back a little, the bystanders came up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for you have a Galilean accent."
At that moment, he started swearing and crossing his arms, saying, "I don't know this man." And at that time, the rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
In the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted together to put Jesus to death.
And they stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him, and
And when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
He told them, "I committed a sin by selling the blood of an innocent person." They said, "We don't care. Sort it out yourself."
And he threw the silver into the temple and went out, and went and hanged himself.
But the chief priests scoffed at the idea, saying, "This is not lawful money to put into the treasury, since it is blood money."
If they don't agree and buy the potter's land to turn it into a cemetery to bury the Berraines, it will be a shame.
That's why this place is still called "Sania Dam" today.
Zec 11:12-13; Jer 32:6-15; 18:2-3 Thus was fulfilled what the prophet Jeremiah had said: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they priced him whom some sons of Israel priced,
"And they gave him money to buy a potter's field. Just as the Lord commanded me." Pilate asked Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer anything.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
But he answered nothing to any of their questions, to the governor's great amazement. The condemnation of Jesus to death (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And every holiday, the governor would release one of the prisoners whom the people loved.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
And when they were assembled, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
He knew that they had handed it to him out of jealousy.
Now when it was morning, having made a decision, Pilate sat down on the judgment seat, sent his wife to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for I have suffered many things in a dream because of Him."
And the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
The governor asked them again, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify Him!"
He said, "Why, what evil have they done?" But they kept shouting louder, "Crucify him!"
Then when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; do with him as you please."
And all the people answered, "We and our children are required by His blood!"
Then they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). And they offered him wine mixed with gall to drink, but when he had tasted it, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!" (Mark 15:22-23, 29-30; John 19:17-18, 28-30)
Then the soldiers led Jesus into the governor's palace, and they gathered the whole battalion before him.
And we tried to dress him up in a red outfit.
And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a reed in his hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, tightened the reed, and hit him on the head with it.
After they had mocked him, they took off his purple robe and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
And as they led him out of the city, a man from Cyrene named Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull,"
They gave him a mixed drink, something they call "mer" to drink, but when he tasted it, he didn't want to drink it.
## Translation: **Mark 15:24** And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
And they sat and kept watching him as he went by.
And they put a sign on his head that read: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
They crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and one on his left.
# Mark 2:7-8; 10:25 And the people who passed by were speaking evil against him, wagging their heads and saying:
"The one who is able to tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross if you are the Son of God."
And the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, mocked him, saying,
"He has saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
Mao trusted in God and said, "I am the Son of God. Let God save him if he is pleased with him."
And the criminals who were crucified with him also reviled him with the same words. The death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And at noon the whole world grew dark until three in the afternoon.
# Mark 22:1 And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi! Eloi! lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God! My God! Why have You forsaken Me?"
And some of those who stood by and heard it said, "This man is calling for Elijah!"
# Mark 6:21 Then one of the servants ran and, taking a sponge, filled it with wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
As others said: "Wait, let's see if Elijah will come and save them!"
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
And he rent the veil of the temple in twain from the top to the bottom. And the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
And coming out of the tombs after the resurrection of Jesus, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and what had happened, they were terrified and said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
And there were many women there who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebed's children. They buried Jesus. (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42)
In the evening, a rich man named Joseph from the region of Arimathea arrived. He was also one of Jesus' disciples.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And Joseph took the body of Jesus, wrapped it in clean linen,
And they buried him in a new grave they had dug in the rock, and they placed a large stone at the entrance of the tomb and left.
And behold, there were two women there, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. (Matthew 27:61, Mark 15:47, Luke 23:55)
And from the morning, which is after the day they were preparing, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
And they will say to him, "Remember, our Lord, how that deceiver said, when he was still alive, 'I will rise again in three days.'"
That's why I ordered them to guard the tomb for three days, so that his disciples wouldn't go and steal his body and tell the people, "He has risen from the dead," and lead people astray even more than they already are!
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go and make it as secure as you can."
If they don't go, they'll put wax on the room and soldiers to guard the tomb.
The resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
A great earthquake occurred; an angel from God descended from heaven and came, and stood over the room.
And he saw how the lightning flashed, and its whiteness was like snow.
The guards trembled in fear of him, turning as pale as the dead.
As the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He's not here, he left as he said he would. Come and see the spot where he was placed.
And go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
And if they had gone to the grave soon, they would have been very afraid and happy, and they would have run to the students.
And at the place called The Skull, Jesus said to them, "Peace be with you." Then he went in and showed them his hands and side.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." This is what the soldiers said.
When the women were walking, some soldiers returned to the city and told the chief priests about everything that had happened.
And the chief priests and the elders met together, and they consulted with one another, and they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
And they said to them, "Tell the people, 'His disciples came at night and stole him while we were sleeping.'"
As soon as the governor hears the news, we'll satisfy him and get you out of the problem.
And the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appeared to his disciples (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8).
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And those who sought Jesus bowed down to him, but some of them doubted.
And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
"And teach them to do the thing that I have commanded you, and I will be with you always, even to the end of the age."
John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
This is the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way."
## Isaiah 40:3 "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'"
John the Baptist came into the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And people from the region of Judea and all those living in Jerusalem came out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River after confessing their sins.
And John's garment was of camel's hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying, "He who is mightier than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted by the devil (Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22)
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in the region of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan River by John.
As soon as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens parted and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
# Mark 2:7; Isaiah 42:1 And a voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The temptation of Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)
And at that time the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness.
"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And He fasted forty days and forty nights,
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to the region of Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
And he said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel!"
And when Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And over time, they left their nets and followed him.
After that, he walked a little further and saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in the boat mending their nets.
And at that time they called out to his brothers, "Leave him alone! Let him go with the servants in the boat, and follow him." Jesus drove out a spirit that was mute (Luke 4:31-37).
And Jesus and His disciples went to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The attendees remained amazed by his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes of the Jews.
And there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit.
He said, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
My son, Jesus commanded him and said, "Be silent! Come out of him!"
The evil spirit possessed the man, and he cried out loudly and came out of him.
Everyone remained astonished and began to ask each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! Even the unclean spirits obey him!"
And Jesus' fame spread throughout all the region of Galilee. Simon's mother-in-law was healed (Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41).
As soon as Jesus and his disciples had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, accompanied by James and John.
Wansiba Simon was lying in her bed with a fever when Jesus spoke to her.
He grabbed her, pulled her by the hand, and made her stand up. Then, he started hitting her.
In the evening, when the sun set, people brought him their sick, those who were possessed by demons, all of them.
And all the people that were in Jerusalem were gathered together against the door.
And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus went throughout Galilee (Luke 4:42-44)
And early in the morning, Jesus rose and went to a lonely place and began to pray.
And Simon went with them, and so did James.
When they found him, they said, "Everyone has been looking for you!"
He said, "Let's go to the other nearby cities to preach, because I have come for this purpose."
And he went about preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons. A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on bended knee, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean." Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. (Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
A leper came to him, pleading on bended knee and said, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
My friend, Jesus had compassion on him, reached out his hand, touched him, and said, "I want to, be healed!"
As soon as Jesus spoke, the leprosy left him and he was healed.
And at the time they ordered Jesus to go, and they warned him.
# 13:49; 14:2-32 And they said, "Be careful, don't tell anyone. But go to the priest, let him examine you, and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded for your healing. This will serve as a testimony to them."
As he went along, he began to proclaim and spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town in that region. He dwelt in secluded places, but people from all areas continued to come to him.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Matthew 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
And after some days, Jesus returned to the region of Capernaum, and the news spread that He was in the house.
A lot of people gathered until there was no more space for anyone in front of the door. And he started telling them about the word of God.
They brought him a paralyzed man carried by four men.
But they could not get near him because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering their friends on a mat, they let him down into the room.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
And there were certain of the scribes of the people of the Jews who had come, who began to think in their hearts,
"Does this man speak like this? He's blaspheming! Who, other than God alone, can forgive sins?"
In due time, Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Why do you think about such things?"
Which is easier to say to a paralytic: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up! Shake off your mattress and walk."
"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
I tell you: Get up! Shake your bed and walk to your house.
He got up, stretched out his mat, and walked in front of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus called Levi (Matthew 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
And again Jesus went out to the seashore. All the people came to him, and he taught them.
And as he was walking, he saw Levi, a tax collector, sitting at his tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me." So he got up and followed him.
And when Jesus was sitting at the house of Levi, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Him and His disciples. And a large number of tax collectors and sinners were following along with them.
When the teachers of the law and the Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The debate on fasting (Matthew 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Reply to them: "Can the wedding guests fast while the groom is still among them? As long as the groom is among them, they cannot fast."
But then the days will come when the groom will be far from them, and that's when they will fast.
No one mends old clothes with a piece of new cloth, for the new patch would shrink and make the hole bigger.
"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The new wine would burst the old skins; the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins." (Matthew 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)
And it came to pass that Jesus went through the fields on the Sabbath day, and His disciples began to pluck the ears of wheat and to eat them.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, why are your disciples doing things that are not permitted on the Sabbath?"
Reply to them: "My brother, didn't you read what David and those with him did when they were in need and hungry?"
# I Samuel 21:1-6; II Samuel 8:17 "How did he enter the house of God at the time of Abiathar, who was the chief of the priests, and ate the bread of the Presence, which only the priests were allowed to eat, and even gave some to his companions?"
And Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"Anna, the Son of Man, is Lord of the Sabbath."
The man with the withered hand was healed (Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
And Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man with a withered hand.
They started watching to see if he would heal that man on the Sabbath or not, so that they could accuse him.
My brother told the man with the withered hand, "Stand up and take your place in the middle!"
Then he said to them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil? To save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
Jesus looked at them with indignation and was deeply grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the supporters of Herod to kill him.
Jesus and his disciples walked along the sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed him from the region of Galilee and Judea.
"And Jerusalem, and Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan, and many from the region around Tyre and Sidon, heard of all that he did, and they came to him."
Jesus told his disciples to get him a boat ready in advance, so that the crowd would not crush him.
"Many people have been cured by him, but now every sick person comes to him to be healed."
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God!
And he commanded them strictly not to make him known. (Matthew 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16)
Then Jesus went up to the mountain and called those he wanted to have with him. And they came to him.
And he chose one of them to be with him and called them apostles to send them to preach.
And they will have authority to cast out demons.
And the names of the chosen ones are: Simon, whom he named Peter.
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, whom he named Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
And Judas Iscariot, who would betray him. Jesus and Beelzebul (Matthew 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And Jesus went to a house and again a crowd gathered, to such an extent that Jesus and His disciples could no longer eat a meal.
And when his relatives heard of it, they came to take him away, for people were saying, "He is out of his mind."
And the Jews who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons!"
Jesus called them together and said to them in parables, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
