I'm now suggesting a second part of the series to you.
The minister is lying between you and me.
He fell for the fake news and the illusory success we created.
He told me that he's not comfortable with the series from the inside.
It means it's impossible for us to agree on a second part.
If the minister himself requests a second part.
I cannot
Nevertheless, I repeat my thanks.

At your service.
We took her today, Your Highness.
What are you saying, Sameh?
Take your son Nasser yesterday to play a match with the team he formed.
I agree with him.
This team's mess is all because of the security and drivers.

Whoever wants to play with them can do what they want.
But it shouldn't take the important people who form the heart of the company.
What should I do, my team has a match and I'm short four players.
We don't want excuses.

You know what Eikel was telling me.
He finally lowered the price of the machines for us. He said, "Tamer, O Abu Nasser, the ball is in your court."
Now you've become famous, and the newspapers not only publish your pictures but also caption them as "Patron of Sports at International Bakeries."
I am far from the ball.
This is nonsense.
I've been like this since I was in middle school.
The person next to me was playing football.
You're saying stay away from the ball.
As long as the one next to me is playing football, I am close to the ball.
"I'm close to sports, so I'm a sportsman."
According to that, we've become international stadiums, not international bakeries.
Yesterday I heard him say that he wanted to open a sports club.
Of course, and today we meet my sports friends at the International Bakery, Uncle Abu Nasser.
To develop football.
Of course, before the match, we want to know your predictions before you reach the platform.
The match is difficult today.
And the team that controls the midfield will have the upper hand today.
Insha'Allah, we are currently in the process of contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakery team.

It's not pleasing me.
The successful coach
The person who regulates the traffic during the match.
For example, the north is the opposite of the Wakra line.
Frankly, I won't let your coach have his way.
The coach has only been with the team for two months.
We need to find a solution with him.
If Koura understood the game, he would know that the teams are not just attacking from the center for the entire match.
He's relying on his offside trap.

He's not serious, he's just telling you to come over. You're divorced, tell the truth about what happened between you.
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, "This guy didn't impress me."
I feel it's not my responsibility.
Let's skip the extra talk and past issues.
Go to your father and find out from him the reason why your daughter got divorced.
I swear, I'll tell you, brother Rashid.
But what's the reason he divorced her?
No, it's not right, Abu Abdullah. We need to know why the girl got divorced. It's our right to know.
Please, mind your own business.
How can I not interfere when the man is sitting in the majlis, coming to find out why his daughter got divorced.
She who does not know how to appreciate her husband or respect his feelings.
And who is this Barcelona?
No wonder you don't know how to speak Spanish.
Barcelona is not just one thing.
This is Guardiola's team.
So, I'll go now to the man who is waiting for me in the majlis.
If you don't go, I'll go. Fine, stay here. You get out of it. These people don't know how to raise their daughters.
Close the door, don't shake your head like that at me.
It's not enough for her that she left Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, never fails to score a hat-trick in a match.
Maradona, who is Maradona, said that Messi will turn out better than me.
"And your daughter, who has no shame, is mistaken about me. See for yourself."
Your daughter is neither a Barcelonan nor is she from our cloth.

What's wrong, mother? What's bothering you?
When I see the scales, I get depressed.
No one will bother you, mother.
Just let her go, divorce her, divorce her. Don't worry about her. Your father has a lot of money, and there are plenty of girls.
Shut up, you and the one who sent you, my son. I know him well. If he doesn't need anything, then why is he causing trouble?

Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest go to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
And thus, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf Arab states and Iran alone possess 686 billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with 12%, then Iraq with 10%, and Kuwait and the UAE with 9%.
"Then each of them comes, and Venezuela comes with seven percent."
Then Russia by five percent.
Thus, the Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
To unprecedented prices and surpassing one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in its history.
In this episode, we attempt to understand many of the complexities of oil.
And the problems faced by the countries exporting it
Despite the enormous increase in its prices
And the problems experienced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
which will appear successively on the screen or write to us through our website on the Internet www.aljazeera.net
Because today the market is the key factor.
And they are not producing countries.
The factor that determines the price is market power.
It's not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand have a natural part.
But other factors
The other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
And the stock markets and others.
And they turned to the prices of the shares for speculation.
In the commodities, and oil for example.
And tomorrow, one thousand dollars will arrive, God willing.
In 2004, oil prices jumped from $40 to $44.
And today we see that even oil prices
I fluctuate from one day to another.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it rose in the second quarter.
Especially with the onset of spring, most of the world's refineries enter a maintenance period.
"What is always related to the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation has a strong influence and control over the market now.

Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked huge reactions due to its relation to what is called the impending American war.
Political or geopolitical impacts.
You are affecting the oil market in a way that is either negative or positive, but in a **very rapid** manner.
The impact may certainly have its effects on him.
Even the speculators also engage in political speculation.
"He who asserts must prove it; some might tell you that the American war on Iran is coming."
Here, what will the market be optimistic about? The market is optimistic in a certain way.
The question remains, given the efforts of the representative now, given that the White House is involved.
This returned the area to an atmosphere of tension.
This is a lemming.
But perhaps Fallon saw this scenario.
A very rapid reflection is reflected in the oil market.
Today, we will prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example over the past seven weeks.
In the United States, oil inventories have increased to more than the average of the last five years.
Today, I mean, I don't know,
And not even for the upcoming war, because today I tell you that even the world has a bitter stock.
Even today's global consumption, show me any country in the world where there are long lines or queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What is the danger that this matter poses to?
What number do you expect "I don't know" to be?
Maybe it's three hundred dollars, maybe less.
He might arrive if these tensions escalate into real conflicts.
Because, as you said, the Gulf region makes up sixty percent.
In a country that is far even from oil-producing nations.
The impact comes in reverse on the oil market.
And it can reach three hundred dollars.
And they moved from stocks and other assets to the oil market today, see over two trillion dollars.
Today we see Brent.
"It trades over a million barrels a day. That means..."
The ongoing tensions in the region and the anticipation...
April, as has been said before, was to be the month to launch this war.
"And God knows best, I did not mean my generation."
It seems like your text is
This is an Arabic phrase, and the translation to English is: "It's an election year."
The current American administration has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand troops in his final days in the White House.
We see, but do not jump to conclusions.
But I don't expect this scenario to happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
You will not bear any cost; it is you, the Iranians, and the consumer countries who will pay.
America Today
Now it relies on African oil and has many alternatives.
Let's speak clearly, there's no point beating around the bush.
You said in your introduction that sixty percent...
From oil reserves.
But now they import twenty-two.
"I get oil from the west, from West Africa."
I am from West Africa, and no matter what they import from any region of the world...
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and proven precautions and precautions
"So-called deepwater or offshore production, or production from the deep sea."
The navy and thus the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
And I consider them dreams because they are not reality and truth.
They are ruining it and destroying it.
The important thing is, there is.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
The reason for that is that these countries have a tough number.
It addresses the needs of countries for energy.
Certainly, this emphasizes that there is something called secure supply security.
And despite internal U.S. objections even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still concerns.
What will President Bush do?
It is you who noted that political risks did not come from the Gulf states.
She means no, no, no, it's not about generosity, because no one among us, I mean, no one deals with generosity.
No, I don't deal with generosity a lot.

With America specifically.
Where is the market?
Where is the economic return for us going to?
We won't

Changing the currency, even though the currency has collapsed.
Despite the fact that the return is not in your favor.
No, I haven't reached seventy yet.
It's just the experts' opinion, not mine.
Okay, the dollar fell by thirty-five percent and oil rose higher than this decrease.
That is, if we take the base year as 2004
We expect oil prices to range between $35 and $36.
"That means, of course."
Oil prices have risen.
But the increase is slight, the deputy said.
That means, if we take them.
So, we consider it now.
Even at these prices
That is, if we compare it to 2004.
Here is the translation of the given text into English: "Aiya, the dollar has fallen beyond the percentage of decline."
The provided Arabic
Reacting to the decline of the dollar
The lower the dollar falls, the higher oil prices rise.
And this is also something the market has started to give him a sense of.
Our interest now is to lower it.
Now the situation has changed. Perhaps, at the beginning of the decline two years ago, this was said, but the situation has now changed, and there is...
And the dollar began to lose value against major currencies such as the euro, yen, and sterling.
So the question here is, why do you insist on linking your currency to the dollar?
His actions are weakening, and they have no cover.
This is it, this is it, it's a historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It states that America in the mid-seventies was...
The gold standard, which was once used for US currency, has been abolished.
This is not correct.
So, what's the right thing to do?
The OPEC comprises
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia.
Today's OPEC meeting in the global market.
Forty percent

If you priced it in another currency, everyone would buy it.

But there is also a report from the Gulf Finance House stating that there are four Gulf countries, as Oman has withdrawn from the unified Gulf currency.
I read the disclaimer in Dungeons and I don't think it's a real disclaimer.
He, the director of the Qatar Central Bank, issued a denial.
He said yes and that he will study, but also all Gulf countries should.
You need to study profit and loss in a thorough manner, without emotions, just as I said.

The political decision boils down to two rights.
There is no third to them, the first need.
Regarding its intention or the five countries, including Kuwait, regarding their intention in 2010 to issue a currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to delink from the dollar.

Tense situation
As observers say, 2008, Global House said that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
In order to halt the inflation process that
And that's my question now: when will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
And I'll hear your answer after a short break.
The topic of today's episode is the oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, specifically the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
She has a reserve of sixty-four billion.
Two out of ten barrels
"And you walk nine and two tenths of a day."
One million Kuwaiti dinars is one hundred and fifty billion, two hundred and seventy million.
Qatar: 15.2 billion Omani Rial 5.6 billion Note: The original text appears to be a mix of Arabic numerals and words, with some inconsistencies in formatting. The translation above assumes that "خمسين الف" refers to 50,000 and "وتنتق" is a typo or irrelevant to the value.
Bahrain has a population of around 1.5 million and a density of 35,000.
And eight and thirty billion was the total revenue for the year.
From 2003 to 2007
In Europe, there are a hundred billion.
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
But the GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was $717 billion in 2006.
The total output in 2007 is expected to be seven and a half billion dollars.
In 1989, one out of ten billion.
But the inflation that devours the salaries of employees and workers who live in this area.
It will increase in two thousand eight to three and eight tenths.
Kuwait accounted for fourteen percent of the UAE's population in 2008, nine out of ten.
It will be ten, but Saudi Arabia was six and a half, it will reach six.
"وتمانيه من عشره" translates to "Eight out of ten" in English.
Salaries are being devoured.
So, what are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the salaries of these poor employees?
If we want to solve the problem.

Salaries are always increasing.
It is not the solution.
I am not against raising salaries.

Of course, she believes.
The issue of excessive increase and lack of control over inflation is that inflation will eat up all these increases.
To address inflation, a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists is required.
And now this committee is forming.
Because of the increase in salaries worldwide.
And the golden economic rule says, of course,
It will have no end.
And whatever
Salaries have risen, and they will continue to increase.
Inflation will rise.
"It must be treated, and it must be done."
In a scientific study, here at Bayt.com, the specialized employment institution, a study was conducted in partnership with the British YouGov Sirag.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty important sectors.
Especially for experts and those in leading positions, there is no job satisfaction.
The inflation has become a devouring monster.
Especially the experienced ones.
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation is eating away at them.
You are about to lose.
This is the easy idea, meaning this is where you put the easy idea and try to apply it.
The relationship of inflation is the increase in salaries.
The parallelism in the subject exists.

I want to talk to you both and talk to Al-Aqil.
I also want a raise in salary.
The salaries are excellent and good. So, good.
May God keep you safe. This is regarding the subject that we discussed, which requires our action.
With the poor, and always, God willing, there won't be poor people in Qatar, and we are certain of that.
And the judge stated that Qatar, as he claimed, sends funds to the ruling family and the ruler.
That's the important question now.
Okay, let's respond to the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What happens to this wealth?
Now there are entirely new cities, almost like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar has started to expand.
The issue is not the issue.
Proportionate urban plan
In short, we have two minutes left. Where will Qatar go?
Qatar is now in the post-oil and gas era.
Of course, there is a clear policy of the state.
Because it is not.
The translation
The translation of
The trend in Qatar is therefore...
The capital of the Middle East in education.
Today we see ourselves as the cultural city, the educational city.
Today, this educational city hosts some of the best universities in the world.
Establishing medical cities, media cities, and financial cities.
Today, oil and gas are... (The sentence is incomplete in the original text, so I cannot provide a full translation.)
No, of course not, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
It's not just Al Jazeera; you're going to create a hundred Al Jazeeras and can't tolerate one.
So, my brother, these are countries, our countries in the Gulf, now.
The boom of the seventies, now everyone remembers the boom of the seventies.
Today, when we look at Qatar, we see growth.
And this also calls for a special episode about post-oil Qatar.
Our vision for oil, its future, and its wealth in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I extend my greetings to the program team.
And this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without limits, and peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah.
"Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings."
I greet you live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of the program Without Borders.
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With enemies of the United States in the region.
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
Indeed, Hamas leaders enjoy distinguished relations with the Qatari leadership.
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006
And still, there is unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
By the time Qatar reconciled, by the time Qatar reconciled.
With her older sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, H, about two years ago.
At the same time, there were clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanon file, where you succeeded where others failed.
I gathered the Lebanese leaders in Doha, where they signed an agreement that led them safely.
Until the recent elections
As for the files, they are resistant.
What mattered to her was that she be the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab countries
And in today's episode...
We are trying to understand the principles and foundations upon which Qatar's foreign policy is based.
And in whose interest?
The small country of Qatar, both geographically and in terms of population, plays these significant roles.
And what are the qualifications that enable her?
That is in a live dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar.
And for our viewers who wish to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers, which will appear consecutively on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
The thunder of Al Jazeera's guns desires to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
I am from the past, from an attempt at a Saudi coup against the Emir of Qatar in collaboration with members of the Al Murra tribe.
In its issue published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the little things that make life wonderful.
I don't think she's accurate.
The precise thing is that in more than one interview here in this program, I always used to say
And we consider it the backbone.
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
There was a misunderstanding.
Then, after that
The translation of "واختلاف وجهات النظر" into English is: "and the difference of opinions"
I correctly settled the issue of borders, which was a major obstacle.
The historical relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar are distinct.
These relationships, if we observe them.
The relationship between the two families and between the two countries.
There was a misunderstanding between them.
Neither before us nor before them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And the relations are now in a situation where I can confirm that it is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council.
But how was the situation of Al Jazeera Channel with Saudi Arabia resolved? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to the events of 2002.
There's an important point.
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
Not only the elder sister, but I was saying that our dependence in the Cooperation Council is on...
I believe that Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And our relationships with them, we give them importance.
There was a media exchange, and this was clear to both parties.
These countries found themselves.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "It failed when the brothers agreed."
The Qatari-Saudi private house
Rather, they found that the most important ones had entered into a dispute.
The translated phrase "لا ناقه لهم فيه
And I don't think it was a strategy for anyone who entered into this dispute.
But Sheikh, allow me, allow me here in this context to put the dots above the letters so that matters are clear.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has, in the last two years,
At a time when the situations that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still ongoing...
I accept the conditions within Saudi Arabia.
Whether it's the arrested people, the opponents, or others, the list is still ongoing.
Al-Jazeera has stopped covering these issues.
Until Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj changes.
Praise for the regime and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts...
I don't see why you don't ask the island administration about this subject. Don't ask me because I...
Unite the two countries.
The stabilization of the region.
This strategy continued and strengthened, first stabilizing the region.
The region refers to the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many issues that are skillfully handled in the Gulf region.
Also, we respond to the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
It had an impact on all listeners and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, surpassing, and burying Arab disputes.
Not only in views means
No, it's about politics, and politics are points of view.
In the Arab world, it is believed that this...
A kind of war
While in the developed world
You're talking about the same interest.
You have stayed for several years now.
The situation now, the situation now.
"Shouf a
There is a complete difference between this subject and that subject.
The idea that a small country is striking the big ones and making them feel weak in front of it.
Any disagreement or any misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And his reasons ended.
It ended with the rule of the two leaders.
Are there guarantees for future relationships?
There are guarantees for both parties.
Based on the love, brotherhood, and interests that unite the two countries.
And the leaders' words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope that this Qatari-Saudi relationship will continue to develop and flourish.
For the better and there are vast fields.
This relationship is similar to the model we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
In terms of Qatar, it is an important country.
Sure, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What kind of country is Egypt to Qatar, even now that you have reconciled with Saudi Arabia?
And three organizations are Hezbollah.
The translation of
He is on the system in Egypt, the largest Arab country.
First, let me start with the following introduction.
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian nation.
And her interests.
With many Arab remnants and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people.
And this is an issue.
Someone thinks that this is an issue we want to use as an entry point for understanding or misunderstanding with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
In the context of this, when you say we respect Egypt and the Egyptian people...
And we believe that he is a good person.
We disagree with Egypt on two points.
The translation
We were accused of preparing for a coup in Gaza, which I don't believe.
And we don't enter.
On matters concerning other countries
Do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does this mean that you had any involvement in the coup that Hamas carried out against the authority in Gaza?
Of course not, we didn't know about it either, we only found out like the rest from the media.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas, and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt differ or have a disagreement with you on this point?
This is coming to me.
The translation of "مؤامره
The plot of Hezbollah and also...
But I'm talking about my country.
We were very surprised by this subject.
If Qatar's interests tremble
The phrase "الاهرام
"Osl qalt al-Ahram"
To undermine Egypt and its status
Possible to reply.
It's clear that we should return to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this matter.
I'm not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve, from her, the Egyptian people, I absolve her, President Hosni Mubarak.
If we go back a long way to the Mina Conference
After the Madrid conference, they remember the summit that was held in Doha.
And this was an agreement when the conference was held with us.
They said we don't want to organize the conference.
"Guys, we know that you are coordinating with Israel."
I am from Qatar, and this is the thing.
What we want to understand is what.
We sat down and started talking, and the conversation was always pleasant.
It has two parts.
"ما هم
In disagreement.
The political orientation
"When we came to the conference, what
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother, H.E. President Hosni Mubarak.
And we received news from a foreign state.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a perspective on this matter, which they find complex.
And they kill people while we watch.
If you don't want to meet in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League University.
And it is shameful that on the sidelines of the Kuwait Conference I discuss an issue.
I am accepted by Israel and the Western world, and they are watching the subject.
When we came, we said, "Okay, now this is happening, and there is no power or might for us Arabs to stop it. No major power has stopped this fighting."
Egypt's announcement of a request to cease hostilities in Gaza was followed by a halt in fighting within an hour.
So even we...
We should not take the Arab street for granted. Our disagreement with the Brotherhood is on one point only.
And this is in international customs.
And our hospitals don't have enough doctors; they're standing on the borders.
You stopped at the border.
There, and no one would enter.
The Muslim Brotherhood were very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect Egypt's sovereignty.
And a stance was known, but this does not harm the Egyptian stance.
We hope for a lot in Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe you can help amplify our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
For all other parties
This translates to: **"That means even
What the Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza from the conference
Whether it's a donors' conference or not, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference; we were invited to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And we met in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
But you will spend.
For the affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and that was it.
Because entry is prohibited from every direction.
I make the Egyptians happy, and all the people of Qatar make the Egyptians happy because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political affairs is important to us.
But you are anticipating.
Just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers spoke proudly of what had been achieved and said:
And whoever bids against Egypt, we will cut off his tongue and break his arm.
By God, I believe this official has harmed his country.
No, they didn't fail, but they couldn't talk about anything but themselves, to be honest.
Those who helped them in this, and this is what I told our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
"I'm following the affairs in the Arab world."
We agree.
The king decided that this was in
We accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But if one of them says "we prevented them," it is an insult to those who prevented them.
As if they were students in a school.
I guess I believe that.
The sharpness is intense.
It is believed that he should exert his power.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this matter.
So they believe that a small country has no right, and the right is withdrawn from it.
The translation of the provided Arabic sentence "انتوا داخلين حاطين انفكم ف دارفور" into English is: "You are interfering in Darfur."
Arab decision at the Arab League
African and a United Nations resolution
I believe the main problem is
Hezbollah's plot has now included Qatar.
Translation: "I don't know what the
So if it happens, even after the swine flu, if it starts in a place, it could be because Qatar might have spread the pandemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and its capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because there is no
Any Arab disagreement weakens our position regarding our main issues, namely Palestine and the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a receiver.
Even our analyses have become the same as theirs.
Western analyses
While we know Shana, we know what happened in Pakistan.
By God, I wish someone would receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Will anyone reproach Qatar?
Has Qatar done any harm to any Arab country?
Tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
What's possible is that I walk by, say "peace be upon you," and you respond with a greeting to annoy me.
This is another issue, which means you have a problem or a deficiency.
This is your business, not mine.
But if you have an internal problem
I always tell him.
And especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know this man, he is honest.
And a man's words are what he intends.
In his heart, "No, no, no, this is not it, this is not what I always say."
I always say this.
I always say, during the height of our disputes with Saudi Arabia, I used to say these words.
And refer back to all the documents you have on the island, but...
The issue is different.
We said from one side, no, let's stop at this point.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
Let them see their affairs, let them see their mistakes, where.
And we see our mistakes, it doesn't mean that everything we have is right.
This is His Excellency, the Sheikh.
to the existence of internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Denies Qatar's involvement in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and severing its relations with Turkey or other countries.
By God, we have supernatural powers.
And they, praise be to God, are seventy million, so if we can raise eighty.
They also have a problem that they need to address.
You played a role in the Gilad Shalit case, despite knowing that this file is an important one for the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
In the matter of "bint shoufah," we said, "Brothers, this is something the Egyptians do." They said, "Yes."
We want to address this issue in detail.
I accept Israel and another country to see the other side what th
When we saw this matter, we told them, "Brother, if the same conditions that the brothers in Egypt are talking to the brothers about..."
And this we have declared means that there is a responsible person saying, in other words, we have made a mockery of the entire Arab League.
By God, this means he is poor.
So how did he pull it off on us?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains.
And we support this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is with you.
I believe this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island as you accused me.
And the island needs to enter the media competition, as in the West, where there are many media outlets.
In many media outlets, during their teenage years, they all curse each other.
But after a while, they reach the stage of maturity.
The text you provided
First of all, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we won't accept this in Qatar.
Relationships are important.
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a particularity in Saudi-Egyptian relations.
And also Egypt's privacy with any Arab state, Egypt is the largest, the greatest country.
This is true. This is true, but Saudi Arabia has a different history and relationship.
So it's a personal dispute between the officials here and there.
We respect the Excellency of the Egyptian President.
I hope it is confined to a disagreement in policies and viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they are sensitive to things that we haven't yet discovered about what Qatar is doing or something like that.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting with the Egyptian president between the prince?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
As the group of journalists said, it was first described as a secret meeting, but later we found out it was held the very next day.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
The translated phrase "قطيعه اللا رجعه" into English is "Irrevocable breakup".
And I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's say, so that no one interprets it wrongly, that you are comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, for both the small and the great.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate satisfaction, satisfaction would be achieved.
The correct trans
I don't think this is accurate. I believe Egypt is much larger than this. I think there's been a mistake in expression.
Do you have a vision for resolving the issues with Egypt, or are you leaving the Egyptian people to await divine intervention?
This is it, please. I don't want to talk about divine intervention and such, because God knows who will live and who will die.
And here I am inviting.
Fool him into thinking there's a style.
"And our pride in Egypt."
There must be a certain way.
Either you stand with me or you stand against me.
Why does any Arab citizen suffer?
In the Arab world, we suffer for it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power, China has sources of power, France has sources of power, even small countries like Qatar have sources of power.
The phrase
What is clear is that there isn't any.
This is all wrong; you keep making mistakes.
But we are a small country, in my eyes and on my head.
And I'll repeat it a hundred times.
So no one can say we're sensitive.
No one will confiscate them from us.
You have now, as far as Israel is concerned, tickled them.
So before I go to Israel
What is your vision for resolving the issue with Egypt?
What's the problem, they weren't the first either.
And every day they lodge a complaint against America. If I tell you the major countries you are talking about.
They deal with us out of self-interest, and we deal with them out of self-interest.
"All complaints and
In order to destroy the relationship
I believe it diminishes any major country that does that.
It also diminishes our Arab dignity to go running and complaining to each other.
Everything comes and everything we know.
Our vision is to be based on Arab interests.
"And we are with them in everything."
Are there any upcoming steps to repair the relations?
But I know that there are close relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone moved any matters.
"Anyone who is against the rapprochement of the two countries and the two leaders will find themselves on the losing side, because in the end..."
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe in ten years. I really don't know. We, from our side, always attend any conference we are invited to.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend, and if we have an opinion, we express it at the conference.
The translation of "ما
"Because Egypt is our elder sister in any topic, but we have a point of view and we discuss it."
This is all that is required. Whenever the time comes, of course, we will be happy to discuss this matter.
It was canceled due to this policy.
And as I mentioned, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, cancelling a contract and adding a contract are two different things. You're asking about the number of cancellations, but you should ask about how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But as for the policy of the state, we, as I told you, the Egyptian people are close to us in Qatar, deep in our hearts.
Now, on the fourth of June last, you stirred the feelings of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office. On the fourth of June, it was published by Arts.
Why do you say we tickled them when we didn't? If we wanted to tickle them, we could have done it twelve years ago.
Since everyone was against Israel before they made peace with Israel and before secret meetings were held between some Arab countries and Israel.
And after, and after, and after, and after they made peace, most Arabs...
Whether under the table or above it, with Israel or talking to it in any capacity whatsoever.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally, he held a banquet at the residence of the Israeli ambassador, Bella Galilji.
Yes, he was a guest among many present at a banquet whose occasion the ambassador did not specify.
Because in the United Nations, we sit next to Israel, so no one can deny this issue.
We found a glimmer of hope in alleviating the suffering of our brothers in Palestine.
Now the management has changed the matter. Egypt was a small issue for me, but unfortunately...
I didn't raise him, you did.
My question is about the United States and the new administration, and the impact this will have on your relationship as Qataris with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There's a difference of opinion.
The road is a solution to many issues in the area.
And if they are all serious, we help them to the utmost.
Do you expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration?
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar, in Paris yesterday, spoke about what is happening in Iran.
And Iran has distinct relations with it, although its relations with the United States are bad.
First, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Was it shaken by your vision as well, or do you see the agreement as intact, or will you need a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would lead them to peaceful elections.
It's been a year and a half since the elections, a year and a bit since the Doha elections.
We were following it day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a stake in sorting things out in Lebanon.
"We're always close to Lebanon. You know Qataris love Lebanon and often go there." (The last part "من من يعني" is unclear and was not translated as it appears to be incomplete or a typo.)
That means I was probably the first country to visit after a Western country, Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi issue, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
She is at least introducing you to their situation, which is now in greater danger, the danger of the South.
We suffered what we suffered. Why didn't you stop here? Why did you stop here in Qatar?
We did face a lot of pressure on this issue, but this was our vision and the position of His Royal Highness the Prince on this matter.
The topic of the Houthis.
And its stability positively affects us, while its instability negatively affects us.
We intervened as an honest broker between the two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand that if this is to be exploited for other reasons
And I will be with them over there, and we always stood by them in every issue.
"And there is no basis for it in reality."
I see that there is no need for us.
Let's sell it.
And I say this with regret. I know there is a large Arab audience that will be against me.
I would also like to thank our esteemed viewers, hoping that you have followed us well, and hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, I would like to convey to you the greetings of the program team. This is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without boundaries.
"And peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you."
Dear viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this exclusive interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Of course, I say a special and exceptional interview because...
Qatar and this particular man were the main sponsors.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese restraint from both sides was important.
Upon reaching conclusions.
It is very important that external interference is minimised.
Many opinions or suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese Arabic, International if you want to say
But he went through stages.
There's nothing that isn't in something else, and what doesn't matter is that these stages have always existed.
Does it mean complexities in Lebanon?
The translation of
This means that now you have come together and directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese knot is a major knot?
"Lebanese, Arab, regional, international, needs significant decoding."
It's a very simple, small knot, but it was magnified by external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
Lebanese people should not allow this.
It affects security and peace in Lebanon.
Problem number one
External reverberations on Lebanon
You suddenly decided, after 24 hours, to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect it, meaning they couldn't rest for a single minute except for what you graciously provide them with.
The secret, the secret, the secret is that I don't let them rest and think too much.
And they make many connections, that was the secret.
Let's consider the idea of moving them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
She will gather them in many diverse hardships.
In many circumstances
So we brought them out of these circumstances because you are coming to find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must move them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
So, may Allah help us to succeed in the statement of the Phoenician statement or the Beirut statement.
Then we agreed that the most important ones agreed to go to Doha.
Both parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people believe, for instance, that Qatar is biased towards one party against another.
And I'm from Beirut, but...
This means that His Highness the Prince's policy is that if we are intermediaries
In this process
In all honesty, it's a sheikhdom.
Did you consult seriously?
With at least the two main parties concerned about what is happening here in Lebanon: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And he expressed his support for the idea.
This sentence is in Arabic and is not
Everyone wanted a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If he goes, I'll go crazy.
His justifications are weak.
It should have been removed because there was tension between Israel and Palestine.
The Iranian nuclear issue
This means that the Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
The African Union is better than us at solving issues.
"He tries to bring
And he holds conferences to solve the problems of the Arabs, who have been accumulating for years and cannot resolve them.
To unite the Arabs or gather the parties if there is a dispute, or to intervene to support the oppressed.
He must study.
If we want to have a wake-up call for the Arab League, not the university of the Arab world, then we should...
He has the car as a tool for execution.
One of the officials here was Speaker Nabih Berri.
The phrase "يتطلب
Now it means the Lebanese have agreed.
By God, you know, we...
The first one is Qatar.
Never led to any result.
In the interest of the Arab world.
So he is
We tested it in several places.
"At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Agreement"
And the agenda is to resolve the issue, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that
The most important role they have in the Arab world as a whole.
In a position
We stop by agreement.
Come and help us, others.
Because this is a serious subject, and this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached a stage where everyone is playing in our square?
In our courtyard.
It is very important to prioritize the interests of our nations and people.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do between the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia?
What will we do in Somalia? It's not a member of the Arab League.
Why isn't Sudan a member of the Arab League? Iraq isn't a member of the Arab League either.
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope that this is not just a suggestion, but an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with both Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that we should, if asked, do what we can.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It could be a transient phase.
Inshallah, we will find her later.
However, I insist on asking, if you permit, can you play a role in this aspect?
Even if not publicly, you now have, in a sense, gained a certain trust.
We strive for any rapprochement between Arab countries.
And this is His Highness's policy from the beginning, but this subject means...
Could what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is a Lebanese affair. Regional matters are still delicate.
Not closely attached to this situation.
I wish the opposite. I wish that this...
A new phase has begun in the Arab world. This is a wish.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, Sheikhdom, are you afraid that the escalation that existed some time ago will resume?
At least until the end of President George Bush's term.
There is no doubt that I still have concerns, whether it's about Palestine, meaning the issue of Gaza now.
I guess I want to ask...
We don't want anything else.
He commands me to take care of this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can deliver medicine to them.
And food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The one that dies when the electricity cuts out.
"Means I wish..
As members of the Arab League, we agree on an amount for this subject, medicine and food, let's call it medicine and food.
Brother, we don't want the Red Crescent to reach him.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into the details of this subject. I'm just saying that as Arabs, we should provide medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted effort and made a pledge at the Holy Kaaba.
Because in this dispute, only the other party will benefit.
"Not dealing with this party because we will provide you with a solution" is incorrect.
And I
So far, I don't see any signs of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you welcome it?
This is possible, of course, we are human.
At least talk about the State of Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree on every policy, or they may not agree on every policy of Qatar.
They are essentially saying to us, "We don't want you to have relations with Israel or to communicate with them."
Perhaps there are those who consider you to be necessarily a party through the American bases there.
We know how to deal with this subject.
Some said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
As if he met, consulted, or spoke with the Saudi family.
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And that's what I can say by sheer coincidence.
**Subject Two: The Kingdom was Eager to Find a Solution and I Communicated with Prince Saud**
What happened in the last few hours?
Change of tactics, change of negotiation tactics.
The translation of "من قبلكم ام من قبل الاطراف" into English is: "Is it from you or from the parties involved?"
As responsible individuals, we... (The
And from you, from all sides, we locked ourselves in the room.
In the end, we found ourselves that the intervention of His Highness the Amir was crucial.
And from there, the invention progressed.
The, without mentioning it now, has ended.
And it was a clear message when he said, "We know our size, our position, our role, etc., as if..."
He wanted to play the role of mediator without provoking any other party.
Whether Arab, regional, or international
But still,
He became responsible.
Whether you wanted it or not
Some jealousy is a little bit of what we want to avoid jealousy because we are a country.
These countries
You can work or
I believe this is the most comfortable combination.
Perhaps one last or penultimate question: What is your relationship with Washington like now? Is it a distant, prolonged, or distinguished relationship?
That means our relationship with Washington is good, let me put it this way.
There are certainly different points of view on these issues.
But this is our right, and if they speak of democracy, this is democracy.
How is it good? I mean, how do you translate it on the ground as a good relationship with?
If you're talking about economics, she's excellent. If you're talking about education, she's excellent.
If you're talking about health, and if you're talking about politics, I can tell you that it's fine.
In your opinion, clearly, during the next phase.
In my opinion, we should leave the topic of confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the Arab arena.
We reconcile the Palestinians.
We agree on an opinion so that we can be a respected force.
I don't think we have that.
"That we be active." Note:
Thank you, our dear viewers, for your good follow-up, and we will meet again, God willing. With my appreciation.
Welcome, viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to foresee the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Welcome, Sheikh.
To discuss what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue we will be able to
Let's shed light on some of your questions.
The entry of Israeli forces into Gaza by land.
And our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Her dealings with friendly nations.
The translation of "&
And the attempt to find a clear, strong Arab stance that Arab countries...
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
We acknowledge that more than one Arab state has violated.
In an arbitrary manner
And no one was held accountable.
We find that we are accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists.
We are the only ones in the world who are always targeted.
We always discipline in a certain style.
I believe.
To the extent that we won't be able to
To listen at the level of leaders
"To stop the attack, we are the ones."
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not...
We hope that you are right and our perspective is wrong, because the goal...
Solving the problem now is not the goal of a summit.
But is it resolved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now from the ministerial committee does not cancel Qatar's request.
And which was also confirmed by His Highness.
In his speech, he stated: "We are not insistent on it being in Egypt, if the embarrassment is that it should be in Qatar, we are not insistent on it being in Qatar. The summit can be wherever."
An Arab stance that respects others.
Yes, but as for the ministerial...
So we want to tell them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
And Israel
She was not concerned with the decision and continued, still killing and bombing in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we are doing.
What are we doing?
Will Israel ever end?
Implement the remainder of the Security Council resolution.
There will be a confrontation since Israel has not stopped.
The translation of "اطلاق النار ل
**Translation:** "According to the decision, it is considered that it is too late."
For a few days
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
In the end, you support this proposal.
We support an Arab summit, of course. This is our idea, and the idea of several other Arab countries as well. Syria and Yemen have also requested the summit.
I'm sorry, but your sentence
He led all the troops to the camp of moderation.
And a camp of non-moderation
"And what do they mean by 'immoderation'?"
"What distinguishes us from the West"
The "moderate" Arabs they call moderates and the non-moderate Arabs.
We find that there is a moderate nation and a non-moderate nation.
And then we want to know what moderation and immoderation are. Is moderation walking in line with Israel's plans?
"And end the matter in a humiliating way."
Or that we just need to keep the issue alive.
This means: "This is an important question."
The subject is whether countries
This phrase translates to: **"It follows Israel's
I'm not saying that they are acting according to Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
Unless we name our camp Moderation
What is moderation in the Western view?
Do we agree to the slaughter of a specific category of Palestinians?
Of course, there were elections.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking about reality.
The reality that exists is that there are...
The tr
Some call them the Radical Movement.
But we need to ask ourselves, what is this radical movement seeking?
"Is she asking for her rightful due, or is she demanding something unjust?"
"Or should we separate them?"
And we also create other blocks.
The provided text
The translation of
And this started to happen.
And that's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Sheikh, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit from taking place?
I cannot say prevent, as there are citations and everyone knows the subject.
The topic of prohibition.
But, as I mentioned to you, we could have...
Let's take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that was not the goal because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is an urgent need that we believe in.
To others, it seems like a non-urgent matter.
Okay, we went to the Security Council.
He is in a Security Council resolution.
But the Security Council decision, Israel said, "We will continue and then consider the matter."
I just want to focus on that again.
Might we be eager to apply the decision to the weaker party?
How will it differ from the first meeting?
The subject of disagreements usually leads to differences in opinions.
As important as it is
Are we ready to take a clear Arab stance?
"I am a
Clearly supporting our brothers.
And also addressing the Israeli side, I say to them:
This assumes that we should discuss it, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab initiative?
"The forty-eight hours and we are committed. We have committed to the ceasefire for forty-eight hours, but the Israelis have not."
It's natural for disputes to arise in meetings, but the truth is, those disputes...
Expressions convey inner feelings and reflect specific attitudes.
One of the disputes she knew about is...
Some have described Hamas's actions as a "gang."
Not even a minority.
This is a situation that arose, and we responded to it among the brothers of the ministers.
And I believe that this means what the West says.
Although these are radical movements, they are a small minority, and some people say they are like this.
And we do not want to be other people's men.
And therefore always means and I don't mean anyone in particular.
Any foreigner finds
In Western countries, you will find ...
Among the Arabs
Yes, okay, Sheikh Saeed now.
The invitation to the second ministerial meeting.
By God, his agenda should be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from what is happening? What is the position of the three-hundred-million-strong nation?
The text "مليون
The decision of one thousand eight hundred and sixty was issued after it.
The resolution that was issued.
Israel has not implemented it; Israel will implement it after the mission is completed.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
He is to be thanked for this decision.
"That we invoke Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel..." (Note: Chapter VII refers to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which deals with actions in cases of threats to peace, breaches of the peace, or acts of aggression.)
And when asked, they also say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they...
If that's the case, Israel is not to be questioned.
She is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the convening of an Arab summit to what the Security Council would issue?
At the summit, the Security Council will seek us out.
He needs to make a tough decision.
The translation
A responsible person may lose their position.
We, the West, are afraid.
"And we are among those who testify that after they decide, for example..."
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out this aggression should bear the full cost of rebuilding Iraq, as they are the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government, and let's not ask the people who died.
The translation
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
The translation
The translation of
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
He said there were difficulties in the Security Council because it was initially about a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel did not commit to it.
I will commit after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
Because they didn't comply with the decision.
People should really abide by the rules.
Because Israel only accepts after the mission is complete.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All we did
Some of the brothers, unfortunately, acted on their own initiative.
The Gaza siege, they participated in it.
I am a friend of the West, and I don't object to having a relationship with the West.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, if we get one percent of our viewpoint accepted, we'll say we've won.
What is victory?
The Englis
I cannot at this moment say anything about reservations because the decision is not final.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in the formulations.
We did participate in the formulations to some extent, yes we did.
But you did not invite the meeting of Arab ministers with the US Secretary of State.
But I'm sure the brothers who went will stop by our place.
I pointed to Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this field, there is happiness for Sheikh.
From two years ago until this moment
Look, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can claim that we have seen everything.
Are they people?
The Israeli rejection is an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there the dispute began and the siege began.
And Israel, in the month before last, killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And they prefer to remain hungry until we exhaust them because we don't want them to be in power.
The translation of "تلك تلك
It clearly states that the Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
That means, if there were
So who created the Palestinian divide? Perhaps there was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.
"I say to one party, you are right, 100%."
I'm not saying that Hamas is 100% right.
I neither claim that nor say it.
But the mediator usually stands at an equal distance from everyone.
And I don't just mean the mediator, I mean us as Arabs, we should be at an equal distance from everyone.
We don't want it to exist, so we need to end it by any means necessary.
Once upon a time, training right and left forces
And once again, they are under siege, with no funds or salaries given to them.
And once we create a positive model in the West Bank.
Let the people in Gaza see how people are living.
"A comfortable life." The original
In contrast, the opposite is true in Gaza.
You were invited to a second ministerial meeting, the second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time...
Discussions about her are still ongoing between Hamas, with Turkish mediation, and...
This meeting you called seems to be an attempt to circumvent.
"Turning around if we take another initiative."
We don't have any initiatives.
On this subject
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
It is required of me to play a role and we support any Egyptian effort that leads to reaching an understanding.
But it is important
We don't come.
Tomorrow, one side will emerge victorious over the other.
The translation of "ولا الطريق للوئام" into English is: "And not the path to harmony."
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and human requirements.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab state that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required, in your opinion, for Egypt.
The current initiative proposals do not meet those requirements, Your Highness Sheikh.
I have an idea about the initiative.
What has been announced, we hear about it from here and there, we get information about it.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, it should exist, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But also, there are people.
Those who are affected on one side should have their point of view taken into account.
So that we can ensure the success of this mediation.
By the way, consider his point of view.
Hamás' position was clear that this decision was not taken with our opinion in mind, meaning how can such a decision be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in drafting without contacting or taking the opinion of the main party concerned with the subject matter.
We only mean that, of course, we deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with the authorities, let's say, as a one-sided party.
But now there is a rift, one side is in one place and the other side is in another.
This does not mean that if we engage with the people in Gaza, we should disregard our dealings with the group in the West Bank or the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as a people and as one government.
If they ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we've started coordinating together.
What he announced was not what she announced.
Firstly, the decision is not to say no to it; he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it a mechanism.
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from reading the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving its goals.
Stop the fighting.
I don't doubt our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this decision to be non-existent since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will have changed on the ground.
Yes, Your Excellency, the Sheikh, when talking about Egyptian efforts.
Your sentence translates to: "She also shares Turkish efforts at the
"About Arab incapability"
As for Arab disputes that can never be resolved, consequently, he came to occupy a place.
It means: "It was supposed that Arab parties would occupy it."
I welcome Turkey's position.
This is a stance that should be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
And so this natural role
And it is necessary for people to follow me.
There is no Arab consensus on how to address the situation.
One says, "Let them finish the task."
There must be a clear Arab stance against this aggression, its continuation, and the procrastination.
To be in an Arab position opposite him.
Israel is capable of causing suffering in the villages, I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are among the people who always call for peace.
"And we are a country, which means you want to live in peace."
But I'm not asking for an Arab war; I'm asking for a stance.
The trans
In the context of discussing initiatives and proposals, of course you're following what's happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you think
As an observer now, the field reality is...
And the politician who resulted from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions.
It is necessary that he be right.
We agree with this point. We don't agree with you on this point.
The second thing
They are not here now, they are negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing
Okay, in such situations, what is required from Arabs?
This Arab reality
What we witnessed after the start of those operations
"He doubted that the position in the Arab street i
For us as governments
Of course, I am sorry that some people describe this popular gift in such a way.
They sometimes tell me about this subject.
Represent the views of our peoples.
The presidents now.
That means if they want to.
At least let them see what.
Of course, there are high ceilings and there are modest ceilings.
Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel.
The translation
The Israeli representation office in Doha is closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
You believe that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon, we agree upon collectively.
"Well, if there's an Arab agreement."
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
We stand with our Arab brothers.
As long as there is a decision and clear Arab credibility.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
Even countries that do not have relations
Very important
We will not be agents for others.
He says why shouldn't Qatar be a model in this field.
If this is the only model, we're willing to be in it.
But we also want...
An Arab model to which Qatar is committed as part of its Arab commitment.
The translation
And no one will go to sell anyone.
Our problem is the lack of trust between Arab countries.
And I don't want to say our secret, unfortunately, I don't want to tell brokers.
And that is very important.
A formal invitation anywhere, as we should rise above this.
Some countries called in the ambassador, some lodged protests, and some expelled the ambassador, just like in the case of Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned were five permanent member states. All of this is a charade against our peoples.
This translates to: **"That means we talked about
There are those at the highest level who are calling for the opening of fronts. There are those who are calling on Syria to open its front with Israel.
Look, I've told you, we advocate for peace and do not call for fighting with Israel.
And we do not call for fighting with Israel.
To start a fight with Israel.
And how will we agree?
This is also a problem.
What made us talk to each other, overcome our differences, and come together?
I was fascinated by what Sheikh said.
On the condition that countries do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
"يعني الا
The street won't spare us.
The translation
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the Lebanon War?
Do you think there is a difference?
No, I believe there is a difference in goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
The remaining parts, of course, are supposed to be deposited with the United Nations.
"Or something like that."
Lebanon means we have dealt with the Lebanese issue on a large scale.
Israel, of course, needs the countries around it to be weak.
Until you dominate and have the upper hand.
And of course, in countries supported by foreign aid.
And therefore she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
They change this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon, you speak with how many sects?
The phras
While Lebanon is fighting, Palestine talks about one party.
But I want to reiterate to you that the Palestinians' problem is that they listened too much to the Arabs and the foreigners.
"There are two sides, and this is where the gap arises, with each side believing they can control the other."
In your opinion, as a watcher and follower
According to the plan, it will end with a broken bone.
As Arabs, do we accept this, because this example may be repeated for those who are stubborn?
He expresses his opinion.
Whether for Israelis or others in the future.
And we gave an example.
The highest in obedience and in helping to mend broken bones.
There's a saying among us: "Me and my cousin against a stranger, me and my brother against my cousin."
We should now put aside any differences with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or any other group is infallible or above criticism.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must pass this subject.
"He must be br
Because here, failure won't be a failure of the class.
His Excellency Sheikh Qatar usually means that for some time he has been taking the initiative to submit proposals.
And the initiatives to solve this happened in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur. We will discuss this topic, even briefly, later.
"An aḥna" Translation: "If we"
We don't want to burden our brothers because there is sensitivity at times.
I think that the country is taking all these initiatives, we don't have any problem as long as the issue is resolved.
We aren't aiming to put Qatar on the front page right now.
This means it was not among the goals of His Highness the Prince.
These were his goals. How do we stop this bleeding?
And we will stop this tyranny.
What happened means it's beyond imagination.
"And we are in
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
Honesty is the key to reaching a respectable solution.
Talking about initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative stands regarding Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement's solution.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it should be specific to resolve the Darfur problem, as you see the Darfur problem initially.
The Arabs helped.
But the issue we're discussing has reached the international level.
Based on taking revenge on the system, and now we want to resolve the issue but we don't know how to solve it.
And we always implement decisions as you mentioned at the beginning. We are the best at implementing decisions.
Removing the issue from competition. Is there also competition in the topic of Darfur?
I don't want to get into this subject.
Before we conclude this discussion, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will ban the summit.
We wish the summit could be held in an atmosphere different from the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
It will be a shame.
Okay, if the Arab leaders had attended this summit...
When Palestinian blood was flowing in the streets of Gaza, they are now celebrating for financial and economic reasons.
We help in igniting.
But no one seems to be afraid of this street.
What you know about the circumstances means that of course we don't wish for anything but safety for all of us.
And we will be safe.
But it means no one takes anyone in their small pocket.
"The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, I thank you very much."
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how true are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
And what about our Arab region and the extent of its interest in this issue?
These questions and others we put to our guest for today's episode.
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability
She holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Social Work, and Sociology from Qatar University.
And also holds a Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt.
And I have held many positions in the field of disability.
She is a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for Disabled Persons.
Two thousand and ninety-eight
And the Vice President of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999.
Even in 2003
I also contributed to the establishment of the Center for People with Cerebral Palsy.
People with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
And activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world.
I also contributed by giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Ms. Hessa, to this episode.
The approved term is "people with disabilities."
In the beginnings, we used the term "disabled" perhaps in the eighties and before.
It's more educational when...
Whoever provides that education, they fall within that category.
In 1993, an important document appeared at the United Nations.
Speaking of this term, before we delve into the details.
About the remaining regions, although there are regions that are not considered developing or are classified as poor.
And Latin America, in particular, is a reality where this trend may be stronger than in any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise.
The trend towards a rights-based approach is present in the Arab world, you find it in many countries.
It's possible that the resources exist and the political will exists.
Okay, here let me tell you some statistics, perhaps you are of course aware of them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Lady Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
It is largely true.
I have seen it first-hand in Darfur, Gaza, and in regions exposed to such events as wars and conflicts.
There, you don't distinguish between a disabled person and a non-disabled person, as the numbers are large.
"Let's separate the children. The illiteracy rate among females, for example, is approximately three and fifty, or two and fifty." Note: The numbers "three and fifty" or "two and fifty" might be a colloquial way of saying "fifty-three" or "fifty-two" in Arabic. The exact translation could depend on the context and the dialect used.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching schools, even if they do not have a disability.
The city originally had no infrastructure, not even a school for this child.
He can reach her.
For the children and for the other inhabitants, it is...
This means that such projects and agendas are wonderful, but we don't hear about them much in reality.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world.
I am better off than people who are not disabled at all.
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects.
Implementing a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian work and working with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
There is now a higher degree of awareness in the Arab world.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask, given your previous position at the United Nations.
The second point is what?
United Nations laws that call for, for example, combating systems that hinder children's participation in society, would include, for example, the establishment of the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime, as many people in Syria have done?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Kro, tell us from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Al-Sa'id from Kuwait. Go ahead, Nayef.
"Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God."
The translation
Good evening
Good evening, please come in.
If you please, I am intellectually disabled.
So, I hear Arabs say, "The wise understand by hint."
"And in the Quran, it is said: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glory be to Him Who has given us speech and given speech to all things.'"
I've been sitting for more than thirty years, maybe I don't speak, maybe a word or two a day.
"So glorify Allah, and
"So he was talking big, and then I found out..."
This translates to: **"It means an attack on me for exploiting the Quran,
They are slandering me and targeting me, while they themselves are in the lowest depths of the fire.
All I got was defamation.
The translation of "و
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
It falls within this definition: the question, the question of Brother Suleiman.
What are the United Nations programs or reactions concerning the causes of disability, such as political goals or others?
Approach different organizations and agencies.
"To discuss it with her, convince her, and
Disability issues and topics are on her work agenda, meaning...
UNESCO, the International Labor Organization (ILO), UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations indeed place disability at the core of their work.
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children with disabilities.
Suitable opportunities and schools
"From the different environmental and contextual aspects"
Also UNICEF
But there are shortcomings that we must acknowledge, there are shortcomings in the situation at the United Nations as well.
What are the main weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned?
Regarding the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy.
Directly, I was present in my country in the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
My work, in particular, sometimes sees restrictions or shortcomings during rehearsals.
Struggle or attempt and fight, people with disabilities fight for recognition.
Until she reached a point that was somewhat satisfactory, she did not place it in a separate category as desired by the global disability movement.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of her main weaknesses.
The survey conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
Within the staff or within the personnel of those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies; we only got three responses.
The text you
The issue of disability has been permanently, stably, and continuously addressed for many years, despite the fact that this is primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, yes, praise be to God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and the like.
Hello, peace be
Dear Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions regarding Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for people with disabilities.
Is there money allocated by the United Nations?
And do these funds go to governments or to offices specific to the United Nations? And do these aids actually reach the disabled?
And note, finally, that there are no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi, for talking to us from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Go ahead, Ibrahim.
Hello, or

And that is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

I return to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
And he says that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but...
It costs a lot, and he can't afford this expensive operation. So, where should he turn?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it is important to meet the needs of our brother Naji.
Like any other rights, they are the rights of people with disabilities.
All these are rights that this citizen must undoubtedly obtain.
To join the International Convention for Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal agreement.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of individuals within their national scope.
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
It is binding on all countries, and there is supervision to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At the very least, at the level of top officials, there must be awareness.
"We must at least work on these covenants in this way."
Even if there is no significant commitment
There was a response to the reports for the monitoring you were doing, and was there interest?
But don't forget, normative rules are indeed a morally binding document, not legally.
To be in commitment and to ratify it.
We understand that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or raised within the context of a society that suffers from many problems and complexities.
Naji Zakarni, director of the Qatari National Center for the Deaf, is an expert in sign language at Al Jazeera.
To begin with, Mr. Ali expresses his profound gratitude to Al Jazeera Channel.
"The one who kindly aired this special episod
Now Ali is speaking and saying, "I am very proud."
She was a servant to all with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them are unaware of this agreement because there were no training sessions.
Regarding her, especially if it's in schools, hospitals, or in government and private institutions.
It is essential that this agreement be published.
It's as if there were a law concerning people with special needs in all the world's countries.
This is even more confirmed, and it emphasizes the need for states to act.
Adopting and signing this agreement
"Other countries, like the State of Qatar and some others, have also signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us."
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my colleague Naji Zakarna for speaking on behalf of Ali.
I thank you both very much.
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability. Perhaps we can start with the proposal made by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
**About Establishing a Support Fund**
It is a fund for donations and accepts any contributions from countries.
This fund is supposed to be spent on activities that the special rapporteur carries out even when not in session.
Even the Arab countries did not offer donations except for one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those commitments is a current problem in the United Nations.
The box that
"Unfortunately, due to the lack of commitment and interest from the member states."
And many people say, unfortunately, with all confidence that we don't care about the current situations.
It's a matter of obligations.
The translatio
The phrase "الانسان ب ال شكلها العام الواسع" translates to "Human beings in their broad, general form."
The marginalized especially.
But it is for this reason that those covenants exist.
If these countries fulfill their obligations, but the idea that the brother launched is good.
It is essential to add that there should not only be an independent fund, but also existing organizations in the region.
I have my balances.

Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to convey a message of thanks and appreciation to her.
In the past years
With wishes from the families of individuals with special needs.
In support of Sheikhessa Hessa's ongoing support for them
"A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome!"
There is another level, which is genetic.
I believe that there is care at the genetic level that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, it is always the cousin (son of the paternal uncle) who marries his cousin (daughter of the paternal uncle) and his paternal aunt (daughter of the paternal grandfather), and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability. Thank you.
The comment was in response to what was mentioned in the viewers' calls.
The truth is, there is a saying as you mentioned at the national level.
I know that there are guidance and support programs.
Within the health services
"It is also covered under the Hamad Medical
Within the psychological clinic and also in education, I believe there are programs under the Supreme Council for Education.
Special Education Department, I honestly don't know if it still exists.
But it is certain that it is within the health services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And Tahliyeh provides for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, he pointed out the role of genetic factors, consanguineous marriage. Are there awareness campaigns?
For example, for awareness.
In this field
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And it is one of the things that I and others have touched upon in many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not just targeted.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
Similarly for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar, ...
And surely Tunisia.
There are now binding decisions for early examination.
And which has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive a response?
Positivity, especially when it clashes with customs and traditions.
Of course, that's the difficulty. It clashes with societal culture.
It is in the decision to be in strategies, to be in willpower, to confront and commit.
The issue of early screening, for example, is a very important matter before marriage.
I'm asking if there are any statistics regarding people with disabilities.
Especially for people with disabilities in the Arab region.
This phrase translates to: **"App
"And especially"
With the recent events in the region
In conflict zones and hotspots of wars, regarding wars, conflicts, and the like.
For every dead person, three disabled people are met.
The events in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other regions...
"No, never is not enough. First, the issue is me."
With the principles of human rights
There must be a place for disabled people, their programs, and their plans.
Within the existing agendas of ministries, institutions, and governmental and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or unrest
"Only for your speech, the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Navi Pillay."
In the world, and what is even more strange, is that what she said to the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is that the statistics are population-based.
Does this mean that people with disabilities are not included in general population statistics?
Not always announced
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted more than five years ago, I think ...
But frankly,
In cooperation with the local government, the planning council, and the relevant authorities.
The Council considers it a reality and not just a participation from us as an office of the Special Rapporteur.
The more you put, the more disability ratings you get.
The needs that are supposed to be present with me.
The quality of those details is what matters; all these important details that will undoubtedly lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
"Exactly, but at least."
The statistics are somewhat improving in this regard.
Hello, or
My lady, I thank you for this program and thank Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive this attention from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Ms. Hessa.
And her role as a motivator and her role that makes us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise be to Allah, and thanks and great thanks to her and to those who support this category.
Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari. You spoke to us from Qatar. We remain in Qatar with Latifa.

My dear sister, the reality and what we hope for and await is for the problem of our stateless children to be resolved.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope she answers this question.
Hello, peace be
And I bear witness to the services provided by the State of Qatar, especially for the hearing impaired.
We had an early detection program for hearing loss.
There is the Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even the MGOs (Multinational Governmental Organizations) or other civil society assemblies
The reality and the expected is that if I compare in five years.

Many thanks to Karim Naseem, who joined us from Jordan. I'll now go back to our guest.

Whether at the planning level or at the implementation level
But as for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important one,
Children without documents or other identification, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international convention, like many international documents, ...
And commit to translating it into plans and strategies.
To provide those services automatically.
Starting from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or nationality.
Okay, Sheikhah Hessa, so she served as a Special Rapporteur for the United Nations on disability after six years of work.
"Means you were
Perhaps you didn't have enough time. Perhaps the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
This means there are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, through existing organizations, and through governmental institutions in many countries.
In the Arab region in particular, I focus.
There should be more research and larger studies.
We launched a global survey that has yielded more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and extensively.
Coordination among Arab states
Among the same persons, persons with disabilities and their organizations, because they are the ones...
But they have a duty that they must fulfill.
Let them fight for it.
Many thanks.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
So stay with us with your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with... Goodbye.
Good morni
I am so happy to have you with us.
At the beginning, before we start asking different questions and chatting this morning.
"You're welcome, Shaima. I might have congratulated you."
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has really put us on the world map.
Translation: Thank you, Qatar.
"Also, please come, Ali."
First of all, I greet the watching brothers.
And I say congratulations to the hosting and to the entire Qatari people.
"And, God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said, it
Before it was a dream, and now, God willing, it will become a reality and work will start from today or from the time of the announcement.
Were you expecting Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup?
Despite having strong files, meaning countries like the USA, Japan, and Australia, I was not worried in this field, specifically on this topic.
No, let me be honest with you, I'm 70% sure that I won't go to Qatar.
Our file is too big.
There are actually global plans and competition.
We were up for the competition.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's file was indeed strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 World Cup file and its hosting in Qatar...
"What is it that the mathematicians themselves mean by 'F' in 'F-theory'?"
It means a lot to them in this field, and indeed the joy will be immense, God willing.
I mean, I'd like to talk about this. We used to talk before the show, but I thought it would be nice to discuss this on air.
At the moment of announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the news? How was the shock? I don't know. Tell us, tell the viewers. You, tell us and tell the viewers.
In English,
Everyone in the world is behind us.
It seems like your text
How did you see the global media?
On the level of sports channels as a whole, no one was insistent, especially the Arab countries. So, praise be to God, everyone offered their support.
Simply declaring Qatar's win that it has the right to host.
All Arab countries, and it is not strange for them, have made this generous gesture by announcing that they are ready to provide Qatar with whatever it needs.
Media-wise, human resources can be volunteers in the future.
Even at the level of foreign media, Shaima.
I guess I went to celebrate my bad luck.
Include them among those who were included. Among them was the French News Agency, also pictured.
We also have meetings.
No one insisted at all. Qatar has become like this now. Let me tell you, every day I remember.
Hundreds of times a day, from the smallest spot on Earth to the largest.
I expect everyone will know Qatar; for those who don't know Qatar on the globe, it's now famous on the internet.
The owner of the 2022 World Cup
Any football player dreams of serving his country and being part of the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league or not, wishes to represent their national team.
So this means it's a positive thing to kill yourself even in matches.
He will support the national team even if he is not selected to join it, and he will give his all if he does make the cut.
This translates to: "It means whether in training or in matches, as the team's logo is on his chest, so he has to give it his all."
By God, I swear that the officials have not fallen short in their attention to the players, especially the young ones. They teach them professionalism from a young age.
The translation of
Tell me about your experience playing at various age levels. How was your experience, and where do you think is the most important for you?
"And indeed it
I went through the stages in the national team from the seedlings to the first team.
You train in camps with clubs, with the club, with the national team.
Each stage has its own unique character.
Yes, Lana, mashallah, you were always on the move.
We are now used to you, Lana Al-Sport.
"We always see you so sporty. We wanted to get information from you and know the sports news through Lana. So, what's the sports news with you?"
I mean, to be honest, I don't see a lot of variety. In the variety shows, we used to host celebrities in their respective fields, and even in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and others in their field.
To the contrary, sports activity
What's the matter? We used to be the capital of sports.
Qatar and now we have become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of being in entertainment, you should host socio-economic and cultural programs.
You have different fields, you have volleyball, basketball, various championships.
But then sports.
Sweet excellent
I wished for honesty.
I wish that right now, instead of being twenty-five, I was ten years old.
So I think the young players got a chance and a big one.
And they hold it, meaning as they say, in their hands.
Sweetheart, what is it? God willing, the word I want to address to the players is...
Inshallah, the young newcomers who will have a bright future, God willing, will emerge in the coming days.
Of course, I told them this is an opportunity and they must seize it.
This means: "This is an opportunity served on a golden platter, they say."
So they must exploit you to a greater extent.
What's new with you? What's up? What's the latest on the programs you're going to present? I know we've been a bit lazy during the vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
I am in constant touch with the event. God willing, we will be preparing for the Asian Cup, which will start in about a month.
We've only been done for two days, but by the way, let's congratulate the Kuwaiti national team on winning the Gulf Cup.
The news bulletin is also available, so we are keeping up with the intuition along with the news.
Certainly, I am essentially associated with the idea of Qatar TV, as my first appearance to the audience was through the Qatari screen.
He denied this act of kindness to them completely.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "They, by the grace of God, convey the media message across various channels."
Whether they are private channels, sports channels, or other types of channels.
"Thank you, Qatar TV."
We certainly wish you success always, God willing, and we are still on this subject.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakra Club for ...
The Al-Wakra Club fans are one of us.
My childhood in Al Wakrah.
The sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
I'm from the club.
I am still the son of Al Wakrah and the child of Al Wakrah.
Just like I told you before, this program is professional.
Concerns every individual on Qatari soil.
Young people, we already know that young people love sports and addiction just like you.
How can we make sports intersect with social work?
Media awareness primarily means that the media plays a very important role in promoting sports in various aspects of life.
You have a youth addiction, but currently, sports have started to enter schools, and sports awareness has become prevalent in schools.
You have events to celebrate, any sports event they organize no celebrations.
With the Qatar Street initiative, we will see the signs on the streets. This is also considered sports awareness.
The female element should have a designated place, such as in the stands or anywhere else.
This is also a form of feminism, or let's say, sports activism for female participation in the athletic field.
Later, we now have a Qatar women's national team.
So I imagine that, thank God, sports have started to expand.
And I also expect that the time period will be...
To work on many projects and raise awareness on a large scale about the topic of sports, and I expect this to be a sufficient period.
If you study correctly and work correctly
Hey, that's enough, and it's the same idea that we need to exploit it properly, just like you said.
Then there's another point I wanted to exploit, which is how the younger generations can possibly exploit the selected team.
This translates to: **"All capabilities, experiences, devices
It's also important in his job that, praise be to God, we are in Qatar, which is well known among Gulf and Arab societies for their great love of sports.
How can I attract this audience to permanently follow sports news on the website about the matches taking place in Qatar?
And the attendees at the same time
But most Qataris love sports, they love football, the problem is in attendance.
It means that if you enter forums, you will find that the interest is great, especially in the forums of some clubs or clubs where the majority of them are.
A great interest in football in the league.
As a player and as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution you feel could be implemented to prevent you from being drawn away from your sports career and your role as an athlete?
What are the ways your friends can watch the matches?
It depends on the individual themselves, not as a general rule or something.
Some of them like to watch it on TV, or they mean councils that bring people together.
For example, Japan developed a big plan to attract a large audience to attend.
When you attend matches, I collect points, I don't know what it means, they are now looking for solutions, God willing.
And in
The most important point for every player who will be present, God willing, in Qatar, especially in the context of our bid for the 2022 World Cup, is what do you think we might need?
Besides financial support, what do you feel is the most important thing you actually need?
And providing the means that can be used to prepare the generation that truly deserves the name of the Qatari team and participates in the biggest World Cup, the FIFA World Cup.
"The time when he told me that the moment had started to end, I asked myself, 'When?' In my heart, I kept saying, 'When?' Time really flew by quickly with the lovely ones, praise be to God."
We chase the impossible and achieve the dream we thought was impossible. But praise be to God, we are now living it in reality.
Just like Sheikh Mohammed said, these are moments of celebration, but the work begins now.
Insha'Allah, 2022 will see events worthy of Qatar's name.
I congratulate every person on the land of Qatar and sincerely say that Qatar has now become a landmark of the world.
By 2022, hosting...
And thank you to the elegant media personality Lana Al-Adai. We wish you all the best, God willing. We will always follow you to benefit from sports.
Sure, here is the translation: "Thank you very much. The joy is certainly in the eyes of the Emiratis."
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new genre of songs that has emerged recently.
But in the style of a song with fast music and rhythm.
And it is also a distinction among the lovers of rap, God willing.
Join us, our dear viewers, as we embark on our journey from this moment. Good morning!
We're trying to take a look at it.
In short, we can define rap as fast vocal music.
The performers recite the lyrics with hesitation, not delivering them in a quick, rhythmic sing-song manner.
Consisting of a large number of rhymes, it addresses a variety of different topics and issues.
And which may be personal at times
The translation of "اجتماع
And they are often controversial.
And she is quite liberated.
And our rapper viewers don't sing the lyrics.
He repeats it.
And whispering in his voice is a secondary factor.
Generally, the voice is not important in rap songs.
And for this reason, he is not called a singer but a rapper or an MC.
And the rabbi is concerned about the following racism in songs.
For example, the flow is like the flow of whips, synchronization, for instance, or delivery.
The worry has its followers, its audience, its lovers.
They have a unique style specific to rap.
And I expect they will give you a much bigger and better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, welcome.
And God, the first thing is that it was a period when we loved to do something new.
We stand out for something.
So why don't we rap?
Then rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
Translation: "So why i
So we said, "That means we should invent something new."
That means we give him an idea, a message from it.
In it, we talk about the negative and positive aspects that occur in our society.
This translates to: **"It means we deliver a message, first of
This is a form of various arts, and by the way, this information might indicate to the viewer that it has addressed many social and psychological problems among young people to a large extent.
I always expect change, and with the passage of time, I still expect it.
And God was a little weaker than the change.
We've been singing since around 2005. The change was weak at first.
We describe ourselves as the new beginning for us, two thousand and ten.
"It's more popular and well-liked."
She loves, for example, trying to sing and perform in the same style as rap. I've noticed this during this period.
A large percentage of people certainly do.
Also, in his work, we want to talk about how he founded several teams.
A beautiful band, you've had so many concerts. We can talk about this band.
How was it founded and how did the idea come about that one can actually make a difference? And how many of you are there in this group?
And God is in the beginning, we mean, before the band was formed.
Rap reached Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
This translates to: **"Everyone loved the idea of rap, whoever thought of
I go down, Salman goes down, so-and-so goes down, and then a competition arose.
And we met people.
So we started competing with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we finally reached 2010.
In 2010, there was a group system, meaning this was a separate group, meaning three or four people were together.
So, we've said it all. Why not just unify all of us into one group called "Rapperz Tribe"?
The text you provided is
We agreed on this. We said we are all united under one name, standing together as one hand.
And we were like, we were acting like, this thing, and we were saying this idea itself.
Approximately twenty-five people.
"Twenty-five, wow, Mashallah, that's a large number." Note: "Mashallah" is an Arabic phrase that means "God has willed it" and is often used to express approval or admiration.
Okay, will someone play or or or everyone performs rap songs.
And he is the one who coordinates and he is the one who composes.
That means you can say something personal.
How is this number arranged in the group? Excellent, how is twenty-five arranged.
Everyone has their own capabilities.
This translates to: **"It means every member of the band can write a whole song."**
Without seeking help from anyone else.
But there, capabilities can differ, for example, like Salman, he is better than me.
He hears her say no, adjust these words here, they're different.
Everyone can edit each other's work.
Let's help each other a little.
Until there is an official entity that adopts these works, or even a company that claims them.
And there will be distributors too.
This means that the work should appear in a certain style, a high-end one, so that it becomes an official, formal piece.
And honestly, we wish for support. We wish for them to tell us, "Go ahead, we'll produce an album for you." It's like a company building something and telling us, "Go ahead, we're going to produce for you."
We don't have any problems, basically.
Some things are a bit difficult.
So why don't you think of it as your first initiative?
Even just to get to know the first CD.
This way, you might be able to attract potential business partners. What do you think?
In 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed it to the young men, God willing.
How was the turnout?
And Allah
"It's 2007, maybe the art of rap might not be fully established in the Gulf, but it's definitely gaining strength."
Not as strongly now.
So we were sitting, chatting, not going out much, you know, like a large group of young people between Valencia and Quito, for example.
Let's talk about her.
They told us they are arranging a party for us.
And it means they covered all the costs and all the procedures, and the coordination was excellent, and the work was truly beyond our expectations.
He surprised us with his honesty, and it was a great job.
And that was it, there was a bit of pressure, meaning there were no ads, nothing, just the party.
What wasn't in the ads, wasn't anything before the party two days ago.
So we said, "That means no one wants it, meaning a party two days before the announcement of no one wanting it."
"So, we're going inside, meaning before the party starts."
So this means a point in our favor, right?
So it means that our message reaches families, not young people.
Our perspective, or expectation, is that this idea is mainly relevant to young people.
We discovered at this stage that there are categories, more than one category, that listen to us.
There was a particular song that had a lot of interaction with the audience and the band.
"Or otherwise, most of the songs had an interactive element."
It's almost all the songs, but because the songs were many and we were a large number.
The group means almost the entire group.
What are words? How do we solve different issues?
We're talking about the situation we're in, but it came so fast.
At least a little, even if it's a lot.
Even if they spoke before, it wouldn't be me.
It seems like the input text is a mix
That means the rhyme comes out.
This translates to: "**It means we think about it, we write this no,
Okay, so we have a song like this. Let's take a look at it.
I am one of the songs you created.
And we will follow it up, and we will also see the public's opinion on this topic.
"And hopefully they also enjoy such words."
Thank you for liking the introduction because it includes the name of my program.
With you are KD and DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This KG Mr. Bobo with his KT-1 hot to break.
And don't forget the program airs at 9:30 in the morning, so everyone will be in front of the TV.
With us in the numbers is Hassan Naama, and with us in the presentation is Shima Al-Hamadi.
With us in the presentation, Nasser Al-Maliki. The guests of the episode are Qatar's rappers. For sure.
Because the sentence actually contains the name "Al-B" Thank you, guys. May God give you good health. I will do it.
I have to applaud you, and the young people in the control room deserve credit too.
It was recorded last night.
And who wrote the lyrics among you?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I had come, I would have written words for Youssef.
It's not just writing these words, it's about loving to sing, it's about passion.
I expect you need to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup. I think you might be able to participate in them, right?
We are definitely talking about ourselves, which means we are surely releasing a song about this topic.
"But it doesn't have to be formal or too high-class."
So I think there should be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and the love of the homeland.
Through the art of rap, indeed.
Yes, I expect that today we are all waiting for...
We are seeing this live now.
Of course, this cup has arrived and adorned the streets of Doha.
If our viewers are like what we saw in Doha, getting ready to receive the Asian Cup.
And the concerned authorities have completed all the arrangements to receive them.
The cup and the expected crowd are definitely larger than what we have seen.
A while ago, I estimated the length of the corniche from start to finish.
Certainly, they are all eager to welcome this important sporting event.
In upcoming events, God willing, we will follow them in the coming days, God willing.
A group of people came to us and said, "We are organizing a party for you."
But so far, things are still a bit complicated.
The procedures are not definite.
So I tried to mean, for example, I saw Youssef and I saw so-and-so.
And I saw several people I want, I have a topic about a song, and I saw the three of them.
"امناسبين حق الاغنيه" translates to "It's suitable for the song."

To make his discoveries very precise.
The text translates to: "In the region of Marrat, and outside Marrat in Shaqra, and in Ahriamlah, and in Athithah."

So I expect a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself.
There are certain people you look up to.
But it doesn't mean that you should imitate them, but rather feel the need to follow their work first and foremost.
By God, the Arabs of the Gulf in general have a connection with each other.
So, it means I'm not competing in competitions, which means I released a song.
And talk about the subject.
It means that the competition is as meaningful as you say it is.
There should be a connection between us, but only with a specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusay is doing so well, praise be to God, he's creating a buzz.

In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even Morocco or Egypt
One has to stay in touch with you, find out how you're doing, and listen to the songs you produce from time to time.
What is the alternative now?
The alternative currently relies on private pages, for example.
"In the name of what exactly?"
He's not wrong, I just searched it on Google.
In the name of Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers.

Early childhood education is feeble.
Developing skills and nurturing the talented.
We move between, meaning a set of children's skills, whether media or research.
If the personal skills in public speaking are in persuading the audience.
With all these diverse skills, we should create a special program tailored to them that serves their needs.
So we started from the future flags, and we achieved a great achievement in it now. We have reached the graduation projects and their end.
We also reached a large number of young child preachers.
And their creativity.
You also have very young presenters.

This also means the national television.
And we need to attract, acquire, discover, and develop these talents.
From declarative to interrogative.
The text you provided seems to
To read across many diverse fields
In several collaborations between you, you gain ideas from each other.
In every field, for example, the "Promising Preacher" program with the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition is an exhibition for all generations, including this one.
The Scientific Club played a significant role in developing projects and also providing technical support for these projects.
The biggest role is also for the Higher Council for Education and their support for schools and their partnership.
Professor Abdullah, your move to Katara, this great institution.
This also collects a large number of wonderful activities and events.
Is this considered a push forward for the same center imam?
However, you take a building like this separately.

And it gave us a face to deal with the public more easily, meaning...
And pioneering projects as well, good ones.
In many cases, receiving guests and introducing them to the nature of the cultural programs offered to children.

It is the national project for developing children's reading.
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with enormous support.
And this is my main project, which is developing reading and writing children's stories, developing their skills.
Different cultures, which specifically pertain to reading.
Of course, there are many programs.
That means we've recently moved.
And now it means rearranging some, meaning activities.
And its design and development are tailored to suit the nature of visitors, namely Katara.
We certainly wish you all the best, God willing, through this centre.
What contains very important ideas.
Of course, first of all, we thank you for this generous hospitality.
The most important thing is honesty. The more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children are...
The children of today are not the children of yesterday; their childhood is not like ours.
They need us to give more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough listening to his interest and imagination.
And I connect with him intellectually.
They work, meaning their way of dealing with children is like a hotel that provides them with accommodation.
He is a bank that provides him with money.
It's about a child lacking someone to listen to these thoughts, to listen to this imagination.
We have actually been moved, they transferred us in the past few days to the exhibition, they transferred us to twenty or thirty.
Through this exhibition
We wish good luck, God willing, to the projects that won awards.
And thank you for joining us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, God willing.
Even actually these projects are realized and exist in reality, and are not just a dream forever.
Welcome, dear viewers. The Childhood Cultural Center concluded its activities on Monday evening at the Diplomatic Club.
National Exhibition of the Dreams of Generations under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Realities of the Homeland of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of the country's National Day with the participation of more than seventy Qatari children.
The exhibition witnessed diverse activities and various competitions among our visitors.
Innovative projects for children.
"In general, we are pleased to host, on your behalf, our dear viewers, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning."
Good morning, it's a pleasure to see you, dear sister.
First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to visit the center.
It's truly worth talking about this unique exhibition.
We are also pleased with your presence through the program to cover, as much as possible, all the events that took place during this exhibition.
This is the national exhibition of the dreams of generations.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this exhibition.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood
For the National Day celebrations
He had a very natural stop. He had a very important touch with every child.
Empowering children
I live with a dream.
And with the project
This project or dream
In children's dreams, the possibilities are endless.
Its fields are vast; we've defined them within a frame, which is a circle with a diameter of twenty to thirty.
And other main fields of Qatar's Vision 2030
So we began training the children in four stages.
And how do brainstorming mechanisms and toolkit mechanisms expand the child's field of thought?
What exactly do you mean by this sentence?
The translation o
In other words, what our children dream about today.
This project grows with this project.
So this was the truth, that is, the interpretation of this vision, that the children begin to live from this day onward.
I dream big.
Whether it's an environmental field or an area, for example, in health, human development, and other fields.
The one that serves the
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place...
He is at a certain exhibition.
So was all this present through?
The exhibition had guests of honor for the event.
Guests of honor are those from whom children learn as role models.
The Arab fall yesterday was two or three weeks ago.
There were also winners in various awards in the Arab world.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, and the images are definitely a witness to your conversation, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of images that were present in the exhibition and various events, of course.
This is also the owner of the last project, the owner of the forest.
The translation of
This is one of the children's innovations, praise be to God. It means it's a really beautiful idea that we can enhance for the viewer.
Let's talk a bit. What exactly is this topic about, the coloured ball?
So, almost four or five projects talked about this subject, one of which was the colored ball.
He also named the smart stadium.
This ball goes out of bounds.
Her colour changes.
We returned, so I expect us to perform much better in future matches, God willing.
Okay, what does it mean after these dreams?
"To be related to something also means it concerns his needs or interests."
And I expect that, especially when there are officials, they will take into consideration these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects might actually serve us well. The football federation president here in Qatar...
What is our opinion about the idea of a coloured ball?
The translation of
He was very enthusiastic and, of course, the cost of his visit was worth it. He focused on projects related to the ball.
Stop the road and adopt these projects at that moment.
Great for exposing at the moment and adopting these projects.
The audience also voted for a large group of projects presented by our children.
And as for our friends, well, what are the projects that we can say were highlighted the most and received the most votes?
Of course, we have a way of evaluation, there is an evaluation committee with a main evaluation method.
These are the projects that won the awards; they were the first, second, and third place winners.
He was from the forest and won first prize.
He had very detailed plans for the project, and the project was ready to start.
Of course, in addition to the administrative aspect, there are many other administrative aspects that are needed.
She went into very detailed minutiae and also distributed visitor brochures, as if she were ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures that we are seeing.
This is a collection, yes, this is also a collection. Many projects I have participated in.
Perhaps they feel like they're watching movies or cartoons.
Neither has it actually been linked; it may be fulfilled in part; institutions have adopted it.
For example, we give names to projects. What are these projects?
How can this surplus be utilized at home? How is it managed, collected, and reused?
Forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman for the renewal, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a dear guest with us today.
I am honored to be part of the series of classifications by artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharshani.
And who confirmed his presence with many works, including the series "Hearts for Rent"
And they struggled to prove themselves in the artistic arena.
Especially since the field of art does not know flattery.

On the contrary, the program is enjoyable with this cast, to be honest.
We'll see something very simple from one of your works and start the dialogue with you.
You're laughing at me.
Take the fake coat and bring the original one.
Go and get it.
The bisht is present.

The Higher Committee of the Conference
I don't agree with you.
I don't have any objections.
So this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series "Tasanif" whose second part we will watch.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part.
Can you tell us a little about your roles in the series "Tasaneef"? Each episode has a different theme.
What does your contribution tell us about?
Of course, after that.
He has seen those days many times.
And Marrat is also famous for its mountain.
The desert, long sung about by poets through the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
And it points to the antiquity of its past.
Which is one hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And it was said that his lineage was attributed to Imru' al-Qays of the Tamim tribe.
It is distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
Poets sang about her, were enchanted by her, and her fame was linked to her well-known mountain, Jebel Kemit.
So it is said, "Ghadeer Kameet."
Of course, Madinat Madinat is an ancient city.
And it preceded the advent of Islam.
There were ancient artifacts of unknown date, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
"Which we are currently in" or
The great companion Khalid ibn Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered the digging of this well during his passage through the War of Apostasy.
And it remains to this day.
The saying goes: "Secure my wheat, and I'll secure your wives."
If you see a cloud, you see it many times.
Of course, among the other effects is also the Ghadir Khumm.
"The one who is the source of sweet water over the years."
"What was enough for the city for a whole year."
From the beginning of the rains until the next rainy season.
The date of creation of this artifact is also unknown.
There is also the bride and there...
Jabal Kumait is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
And about this mountain, many proverbs, poems, and odes have been said.
Where it comes to him from all parts of the kingdom.
One of its most prominent effects is the Al-Waleedi well.
For it was revealed in the days of the Apostasy wars, when he was heading to Yamama.
So he settled there and ordered his men to dig this well.
The water of which is still used for drinking and ablution to this day.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in his geographical dictionary, Mu'jam al-Buldān, that Khalid passed through Marāt.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
It contains several sections that highlight the architectural character of the region and its renowned heritage and antiquities.
The poet said: "When we reached the water, it was the water of Majnah."
The translation of "غدير كميت لا غدير الاناجل" into English is: "The pond of Kumayt, not the pond of the Gospels."
Professor Ayman, there is also, praise be to God, a cooperation between the family, the guardian, and the center with the child.
And I expect different methods, it is possible that he will be with you step by step.
Managing the training process in general.
From the moment the trainee, student, or child arrives, we start assessing.

Yes, he sees the level he has reached since the beginning of his enrollment at this center until today.
Yes, we have several different models that we will follow.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, he will definitely honor us in a moment.
We're going to see several different models. I wish we had more space.
But we brought a model of a child.
This translates to: **"You'll be facing more than one test live on air."** Here's a breakdown: * **راح يتم:** Will be done * **يعني:** Means * **اكثر من اختبار:** More than one test * **امامكم:** In front of you * **على الهواء مباشره:** Live on air
We ask her math questions and various questions.
We're going to take a short break and will be back with you shortly. Then we'll meet this smart child. Stay tuned.
The artist's audience has become smarter now.
This means: "Any action done in the first two or three buttons [of the remote], he [the viewer] sees the action not done, but [the action] appears on the remote." Here's a more natural English translation: "If you press any of the first two or three buttons on the remote, the action doesn't seem to happen at first, but then it does."
He won't bother; he has twenty thousand other series.
"Correct, there are twenty thousand series,
"Some people do, and some don't. One should focus on one task at a time."
Someone who puts their work out there can see it appreciated.

Of course, we welcome your presence with us as a dear and noble guest, Abdul Aziz Al-Sharsani.
"Do you have any words for your viewers, for your fans? Of course, I love you, I am one of your fans."
Turn to us your word.
I tell them, "Every year, you are in good health."
It's true that we don't go out much, we don't represent much, in the judgment of course, I mentioned the reasons.
The future is better.
Inshallah, we wish you success in your endeavors this year.
God willing, we'll have another meeting to discuss these plays.
It's all connected.
And since fashion shows have become popular and are eagerly awaited by lovers of new models.
We welcome our dear viewers via Sabah Al-Doha, and we are with you live on air.
Today, we are definitely talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of male and female students, and our sons who joined this center.
This is the center that offers a wide range of different sciences.
Surely their focus is on developing various skills.
And also to run their minds at 100% if God wills.
Of course, Professor Naseem and Professor Ayman Khogali, who is the executive director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
May God bless you.
And with us is the beautiful Amanya. Good morning, Amanya.

Masha'Allah, we wish you all the best.
What are the things you provide for our sons and daughters?
It was clarified with Professor Ayman and Professor Nesma, and it was specifically a program that benefits children, our children.
And it is a program for mental mathematics.
Through finger tapping and through the abacus
To achieve certain goals, we tried to clarify a simple part of them.
I felt, Professor, I felt Professor Ibrahim that there was indeed a difference when the student first enters for the first two days.
And after he completes a few months with you, perhaps three or four months.
Whether he studied at public, private, or even independent schools
Principally, the program is scientific and follows certain methods.
After completing the first level of the program
What clarifies where the child's lost abilities are or where they need to be developed to reach them.
"Has he reached a certain limit, or what developments have occurred with the child?"
So we're proceeding in a scientific manner with a scientific program.
It's not just some methods or mechanisms that are regularly applied.
No, not scientifically, systematically.
Before the start of the program, after taking this course or the levels he went through.
Professor Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amina is one of the students who joined this center.
We wanted this to happen live today to show our viewers the importance of this moment.
"Return the bisht, I have no objection." Note: "Bisht" is a traditional Arabic cloak, often worn on formal occasions.
So this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series "Tasanif" that we're going to see the second part of.
But since we've seen this scene from the first part of the series "Classifications"
Can you tell us a little about your roles in the series "Tasaneef"? Each episode has a different theme.
This year, focus on what you're going to do.

We have artists from Qatar.
Many artists don't follow me now. Of course, we have artists from Bahrain like Zohra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohamed Adel
Of course, Tara.
If it weren't for Tara, the young men wouldn't have acted.
Few works have become in Qatar in the past two years; you have two jobs.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works. We can also say that.
Al Jazeera is providing an outlet for production.
Of course, Qatar TV didn't fall short, but they only produce one series a year, and all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I heard that it's a very popular series and all the artists in Qatar want to work on it.
Even if someone experiences a traumatic event, they should say, "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to God).
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Okay, so let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I extend to him my profound gratitude.
Consult him about several things.
Of course, artist Abdulaziz Jasim, from the rule of humans to another day, after the diaspora, to yes and no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he produced his first executive producer, Abdulaziz Jassim. We worked with him both in theater and television.
He is the one who raised us, he is the one who taught us, and he is the one who guided us.
Of course, after Yuva, Professor Ghanem didn't fall short with us in Fayez Al-Tosh 2000.
Because honesty has given us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two jobs a year.
So we have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you Tara.
Of course, the same feeling, from the production of Tara for artistic production.
The director of the series is Mr. Monir Al-Z.
We're back to you, our dear viewers, and today we will talk about reflexology.
Palm healing through the hand's palm.
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We had a guest with us.
The inspection method is as follows:
"Swelling and pain
You feel inside the hand, sometimes like sand, like shattered veins inside the hand.

Of course, my brother is a bit tense.
Do you feel like you're under a lot of pressure? You seem a bit stressed.

Of course, we are now, dear viewers, examining the left side of his body.
So they can be in the picture.
If any health problem appears, it shows now. We knew about the headache, and we knew about the dizziness he experiences.
The best translation of "هه
"الم" means "pain"
What's the problem? What exactly is the problem here?
The translation of "اللي هنا
Do you have a history of sinus surgery or any sinus-related issues?
"He had surgery, but a long time ago."
"وش لحميه او شي"
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is nerve-wracking when you tell him to tighten his nerves.
Ten years ago, I walked barefoot on the beach.
Okay, we know that when someone walks by the sea, they expect to feel relaxed.
Any uneven ground is not just the sea.
Negative energies can affect a person.
He might also be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Certainly, the most important people are the children.
Children, praise be to God, are the mother's focus.
I tired him out with milk and the food that he usually eats.
Her child met her and automatically closed the child lock.
The phrase
"A simple pressure, glorified be God."
After a few seconds, you'll notice the child getting happy. First, he talks to you a bit because of the pain here.
Then suddenly, praise be to God, you see the gases rise.
What discoveries have you made, Professor Abdulaziz?
Just less than the other problems now: joints, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
Secondly, regarding menstrual cramps, or pain during the monthly period, or pain associated with the cycle in general...
You focus on a rock or a stone, or as soon as you press here, you give orders, glory be to God, for lower back pain and menstrual problems. If it were in you, my dear.
Within seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
The pregnant woman.
Make her delivery easy.
"Either here or there, of course, or God knows."
If they tell her that, by God, there is a chance of delivery in the seventh month or the ninth.
Except on sand.
Walking on sand is fine, but not on rocks.
It is better to break your fast with seven fresh dates.
"And if a cluster of dates falls, it is enough, God willing."
As He, the Exalted, said, "I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan," and my discovery of this is, of course, from the Quran.
This translation requires some cultural context. Here
"O Allah, I praise You, and I seek refuge in You from the word 'I'."
The rock answers, the small balls answer.
The birthing bed is flimsy. For example, if a woman goes into labor and grabs the metal rails, they might break.
And you'll even notice that in private hospitals, a Southeast Asian woman comes.
Now, God willing, this is actually a custom in East Asia.
My phone is with you, it doesn't need anything.
Just the mobile (phone).
Cooperating with each other means that everyone is a piece of advice for every creature who hears me now.
"Make sure to give charity, and take care of others. You were created to worship God and then..."
"To serve people is the first thing. Secondly, I am not a religious leader or a sheikh; I am an ordinary person."
Professor Abdulaziz, I thank you for this pleasant meeting. Of course, thank you to our guest who is with us.
May God give you a thousand blessings, amen, and good luck.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will provide us with more detailed information.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start directly with a look at these events.
The truth is a program of healthy steps towards Qatar.
It means: "It is a program that is part of the national strategy to address and combat obesity."
This means that four of the top ten countries with the highest obesity rates in the world are Gulf countries.
So, we have started at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other entities, a strategy to combat obesity.
Out of fear that it will spread further and further, very soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
They organize this competition together, making it an international one.
Of course, the program is six weeks long.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because at the beginning of their lives, they start to be aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about... what is your favorite fruit?
Second week: walking
You have to walk, of course. The more you walk, the more points you get.
It's a map of Qatar, and as one collects points, they can apply them to move their school forward. Each point earned allows a class to take a step ahead.
So there will be healthy competition among the students.
In the third week, he drinks mineral water instead of fizzy water.
So we tell him to get used to drinking his own water; there is no need for a lot of sparkling water. Every time you get thirsty, you take sparkling water. Don't drink plain water.
Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport.
Some people don't like games in school.
So we're looking for a sports game that he likes.
In order to force him to exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that they need to pay attention to their son and make sure he eats a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy is a boys' and girls' academy so we can take...
Of course, this is a sample of its success. God willing, we will expand the experiment in the coming years.
Of course, the students are happy; I don't know how they feel, but our activity is more.
Let's play more games and enjoy more with our colleagues.
The girls tell you that our skin has improved, the acne has decreased.
True, true, exactly, it does happen.
Parents know about their children.
"And their colleagues in the second classes say 'how are you?' to them, and they learn from them and their colleagues and brothers."
And, praise be to God, the word is spreading that many schools are eager to participate in next year's event, of course, from now on.
Inshallah
Of course, the official sponsor was Qtel in supporting this.
We had an Aspire Zone that organized sports competitions for students and raised awareness.
"عل عل عل على طاوله الطعام يعني" translates to: "What does it mean to put it on the dining table?"
Alhamdulillah, there are several aspects, including the one I mentioned, and there might be others that I missed.
But praise be to God, everyone participated with a part of what they had.
Some of the brothers used to hold competitions on Saturdays.
So there was variation in it.
We tried to do several types and include as many people as possible.
He is the future generation.
To generalize this experience or spread it as widely as possible in Qatar.
So you're making adjustments for the first time, meaning there are some things you need to modify.
After its spread, praise be to God, now and the satisfactory results.
Insha'Allah, we will publish it because there are people demanding now, saying, "Why didn't you include us?"
If you eat healthy food, you will achieve that thing, you won't have any problems.
So, at this age, if he starts early, he will achieve what he wants by the time he is twenty or twenty-five years old.
You mentioned a set of titles every week, with one title per week.
If we return, we will try in our segment today to be about the conclusion of the activities.
And also, if we bring people closer in our program, we had more than one hosting.
Let's repeat and revisit every week, what were the pieces of information we wanted to convey to the students?
Inshallah, my sister, of course, the first thing, for example, in the first week, the favorite fruit.
Of course, what are the benefits of fruits as a whole serving compared to a single fruit?
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
So he himself begins to know what he likes about fruit. Not all fruits are his enemies, you know.
So, he might develop an allergy to one or two types, but why not the rest?
**Translation:** Week two of walking. People think it's just for lazy kids. Why are they walking?
The provided text is in Arabic and translates to: "So, when I grow up, I will walk."
On the contrary, you walk because they calm the mind and brain.
And it relaxes the human psyche, meaning that walking brings mental clarity and improves one's state of mind.
You used to make them walk to the students.
No, they are all required to walk whether at school or at home.
And they score their points by grade schools.
Because they are a few, it doesn't mean daily.
So there was an event where people held a march, the girls' school held a march.
We want them to be creative, to have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers coming up with new ideas, we don't want to give them ideas, they shouldn't deviate from them.
So each one had, that is, his skills in this point.
Of course, during the third week, we drink water constantly. We try to drink water so that we don't feel thirsty and crave fizzy drinks.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
So if we can get to his favorite sport and support him in it.
He is crazy about sports.
Their love for sports is that he is playing it, he is doing sports without realizing it.
Since we previously talked about it, we will discuss the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
Let me welcome our guest for today, who has illuminated our studio with their presence.
Welcome!
May God bless you with us in this program.
And from it this disease, perhaps many of us have not heard about it.
"As the Egyptians say, I'll go straight to the point." Note: The phrase "دغري حنخش في الموضوع" is a colloquial Egyptian Arabic expression that translates to "I'll go straight to the point" or "I'll cut to the chase."
It's a chronic disease.

The interval occurs between the ages of twenty and forty.
This disease also currently has no known cure and no known cause for its onset.
It usually affects the active segment of society, which is the youth segment.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may evil stay away from you and other diseases.
This disease is an inflammation of the brain's nerves and spinal cord nerves.
And it is the central nervous system in the human body.
The sentence seems to be in a dialect of
The neuron is a...
What covers this electric wire?
White blood cells are the first to kill or dissolve this protective layer.
This leads to the absence, weakening, or disruption of the nerve signal.
Leads to paralysis, God forbid.
Even with the advancement of medicine, Professor Abdulaziz, we still haven't found a cure for this disease.
Okay, apart from the solution, we want to know how it comes to us, meaning...
One also needs to be cautious about this matter.
The direct cause, the nature of life, the nature of food, circulations of life.
"And what is the exact direct cause that can make a person susceptible to this illness?"
Everything that exists currently is just theories.
Even by marriage
They are trying to solve the health problems faced by humans.
Yes yes
All these topics might stir up some controversy within the community.
So far, we don't know its causes.
Okay, the age group that can be affected by this disease, of course, multiple sclerosis, is typically young adults, usually between the ages of 20 and 40, but it can also occur in children and older adults.

Of course, the disease starts to calm down with the person after reaching forty years.
But so far, we haven't found a solution to this disease.
Does this mean there are actually many people, whether in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even just in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand infected individuals.
And also Qatar means
Personally, I have been informed of three to four very recently diagnosed cases just in the past week.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five injured. This is recorded in the files.
And there are many people who, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatments in other countries, for example.
Alright, Professor Abdulaziz, so are there any effects, for example, on a person who contracts this disease?
Are there any signs that give to the family of the affected person or to the person themselves that they are suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus seemed to eliminate, for example,
Okay, let's be honest, it's not a virus.
Because it's a nervous disease; the nerves control the whole body.
Let's deviate a bit and give a specific reason for a particular place, like the nature of the food or the nature of the people.
