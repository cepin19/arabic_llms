The greatest in the kingdom of heaven
At that hour, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a child to Him and placed him among them.
And he said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And before, a single child like this in my name has accepted me.
And whoever stumbles upon one of these little believers in me, it is better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to drown in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world from stumbling blocks! Surely, stumbling blocks will come, but woe to that person through whom they come!
If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to be thrown into hellfire with two eyes. Like the lost sheep
Look, do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
For the Son of Man came to save what was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the lost one?
And if he happens to find it, I tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
Thus, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that any of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
And if your brother sins against you, go and reprove him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
And if he does not hear, then take with you one or two others, so that every word may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
And if he does not hear them, tell it to the church. And if he does not hear the church, let him be to you as a tax collector and a sinner.
Truly I tell you: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And I also say to you: If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered in My name, there I am in the midst of them." Like the servant who does not forgive
Then Peter came up to him and said, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him: "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began the accounting, one debtor came to him with ten thousand and a weight.
And since he had nothing to fulfill his master's command to sell himself, his wife, his children, and all that he had, and to settle the debt.
The servant's pride and he bowed to him, saying: O master, wait for me so I can fulfill all my promises to you.
Then that servant's master was pleased and set him free, leaving him the debt.
When that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred dinars. He seized him and took him by the neck, saying: "Pay me what you owe me."
The servant's pride is his companion at his feet, and he asked him, saying: "Wait for me, and I will fulfill all your needs."
He did not respond, but went on and threw him into prison until the debt was paid.
When the servants saw what had happened to their companions, they were very sad. They came and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then his master called him and said: O wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Shouldn't you also have mercy on your servant, Rafiq, as I have had mercy on you?
And his master became angry and handed him over to the tormentors until he paid back all that he owed him.
Thus, my heavenly Father will do to you if you do not leave in your hearts each one of you his brother's faults.
Marriage and Divorce
When Jesus had finished this talk, he moved from Galilee and came to the outskirts of Judea across the Jordan.
And many crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
And the Pharisees came to him to test him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
And he answered them and said: "Have you not read that He who created from the beginning created them male and female?"
And he said: For this reason, a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife, and the two become one flesh.
They are not two but one body. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They asked him: "Why did Moses recommend giving a divorce certificate so that she would be divorced?"
He said to them: "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart. But from the beginning it was not so."
And I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife except due to fornication and marries another, commits fornication; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits fornication.
His disciples said to him: "If such is the case with a man regarding a woman, it is not acceptable to marry!"
He said to them: "Not everyone accepts this word, but those to whom it is given."
For there are eunuchs who were born this way from their mothers' wombs, and there are eunuchs whom people have made eunuchs, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone who can accept this accept it. Jesus blesses the children.
Then the children came to him to lay their hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said: "Let the children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He placed his hands on them and left from there. The wealthy young man
And if one approached and said to him: "Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
He said to him: "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, that is God. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
He said to him: "Which commandments?" Jesus said: "Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.
The young man said to him: "I have memorized all of these since my youth. What more do I need?"
Jesus said to him: "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven; then come, follow me."
When the young man heard the word, he left sad because he was wealthy.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And I also say to you: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!
When his disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Who then can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him then, saying, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?"
Jesus said to them: "Truly I tell you, you who have followed me, in the renewal, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever leaves homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for My name's sake will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
Like the act of generosity
For the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers on a dinar per day, and sent them to his vineyard.
Then he went out around the third hour and saw others standing in the market, unemployed.
He said to them: "Go also to the vineyard, and I will give you what is right." So they went away.
And he also went out around the sixth and ninth hours, and did the same.
Then around eleven o'clock he went out and found others standing around idly, and he said to them: Why have you been standing here all day idling?
They told him: Because no one hired us. He said to them: Go also to the vineyard and take what is rightfully yours.
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his agent: "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting from the last to the first."
Then the owners of the eleventh hour came, and they took a dinar each.
When the first ones arrived, they thought they would take more. So they also took a dinar each.
And while they were taking, they complained against the Lord of the house.
Saying: These others worked for one hour, and we have made them equal to us, who bore the burden of the day and the heat!
And he replied to one of them: "O owner, I have not wronged you! Did we not agree on a dinar?"
Take what belongs to you and go, for I want to give this last one to you as well.
Or is it not permissible for me to do what I want with what I have? Or is your eye evil because I am righteous?
Thus, the last shall be first, and the first last, for many are called, but few are chosen. Jesus foretells His death and resurrection.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately on the road and said to them:
Here we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
And they deliver him to the nations to mock him, scourge him, and crucify him; and on the third day, he will rise. The mother of James and John requested.
Then, the mother of Zebedee's children approached Him with her sons, and she bowed down and asked Him for something.
He said to her: "What do you want?" She said to him: "Say that my two sons may sit, one at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom."
Jesus answered and said: "You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to him, "We are able."
He said to them: "As for my cup, you will drink it, and with the dye with which I am dyed, you will be dyed. But to sit at my right and at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When they heard the ten, they became angry because of the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them and said: "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.
Let it not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be your servant.
The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of the blind in Jericho
And as they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed them.
And when two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
So he rebuked them, the crowd, to be silent, and they began to shout even more, saying: "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him: "Lord, open our eyes!"
Jesus opened their eyes and touched them, and immediately they saw. They followed Him.
Entering Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples
Saying to them: "Go to the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied with a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone says anything to you, say: The Lord needs them. Immediately, He will send them.
All of this was so that what was said by the Prophet might be fulfilled:
Tell the daughter of Zion: Behold, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
The two students went and did as Jesus commanded them.
And they brought the two donkeys and the colt, and placed their clothes on them, then sat upon them.
And the majority gathered and spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and laid them on the road.
And the crowds who went before and those who followed were shouting, saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken, saying: "Who is this?"
The crowds said: "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Cleansing of the temple
Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
And He said to them: "It is written: My house shall be called a house of prayer." But you have made it a den of thieves!
And my uncle and a lame man approached him in the temple, and he healed them.
When the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders He had performed, and the children shouting in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!", they became angry.
And they said to him: "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! Have you never read: Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have perfected praise?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and stayed there. The fig tree withered.
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
So he looked at a fig tree on the road, and he came to it but found nothing in it but leaves. He said to it: "May there never be fruit from you again forever!" The fig tree immediately withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered them and said, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and it will be done."
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive." The question about the authority of Jesus
And when he came to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him, and they knew, saying, "By what authority are you doing this? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them and said, "I also ask you one question; if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things:"
John's baptism: where was it from? From heaven or from men?». So they reasoned among themselves, saying: «If we say: from heaven, He will say to us: Why then did you not believe him?»
And if we say: from the people, we fear the crowd, because John is like a prophet to everyone.
They answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons."
What do you think? There was a man with two sons, and he came to the first and said: My son, go today and work in my vineyard.
He replied and said: I do not want to. But he finally regretted and went away.
And he came to the second and said likewise. So he answered and said: Here I am, my lord. And he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of the Father?». They said to Him: «The first». Jesus said to them: «Truly I tell you: the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you,
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And you, seeing this, did not even afterward change your minds to believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen, for example, the last: There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and entrusted it to tenants, then traveled.
And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers to collect his fruit.
Then the noblemen took their slaves, whipped some, killed some, and stoned some.
Then he also sent other servants more than the first ones, and they did to them likewise.
Finally, his son sent to them saying: They fear my son!
And as for the noble ones, when they saw the son, they said among themselves: This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance!
They took him out and killed him outside the vineyard.
So when the generous one arrives, what does he do with those noble ones?
They said to him: "Those miserable ones will perish miserably, and the noble will be handed over to other noblemen who will give them the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes!"
Therefore I say to you: the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing its fruits.
And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; and whoever it falls on will be crushed!».
And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his words, they realized that he was speaking about them.
And when they were trying to seize him, they feared the crowd, because they considered him like a prophet.
Like the prince's wedding
And Jesus also spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a king, who made a wedding for his son.
And he sent his servants to invite those who were invited to the wedding, but they refused to come.
Then he sent other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited: Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding!"
But they were negligent and went their separate ways, one to his field, and another to his trade.
And the remaining ones captured their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he became angry, sent his soldiers, and destroyed those killers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants: The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
Go to the crossroads, and whoever you find there, invite him to the wedding.
Then those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all the people they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.
When the king entered to see the reclining guests, he saw there a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said to him: "O companion, how did you come in here without your wedding attire?" He remained silent.
Then the king said to the servants: Bind his feet and hands, take him and cast him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Because many claim and few vote. Paying tribute to Caesar
Then the Pharisees went and conspired to catch Him in His words.
So they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone, for you do not look at people's faces."
So tell us: what do you think? Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar or not?
Then Jesus knew their evil intent and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the payment of the jizyah. So they gave him a dinar.
He asked them: "To whom are this picture and writing?"
They said to him: "To Caesar." He replied to them: "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard, they were amazed, left him, and went away. The question about the resurrection of the dead
On that day, Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him.
Saying: "O Teacher," Moses said: "If someone dies without children, his brother shall marry his wife and establish descendants for his brother."
We had seven brothers, and the first one married and died. Since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And also the second and the third to the seventh.
And finally, the woman also died.
In the Resurrection, who among the seven will be a wife? For she was for everyone!».
Jesus answered them, and said: "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For they neither marry nor are given in marriage at the resurrection; but they are like the angels of God in heaven.
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by Allah the Speaker:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living.
When the crowds heard him, they were stunned by his teaching. The Great Commandment
As for the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, a policeman, asked him to test him, saying:
Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?
Jesus said to him: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second like it: love your neighbor as yourself.
"With these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets." Christ and David
And while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
He said: "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They said to him: "The son of David."
He said to them: "How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord? saying:"
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
If David calls Him Lord, how then can His Son be?
No one was able to answer him a word. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him a thing.
Warning against the scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.
Saying: "The scribes and Pharisees sat on the seat of Moses,"
So whatever they tell you to memorize, memorize it and do it, but do not act according to their deeds, for they say and do not do.
They pack heavy, burdensome loads and place them on people's shoulders, and they do not want to move them with their finger.
And all their works they do to be seen by men: they make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments,
And they love the first seat at banquets and the first places in gatherings.
Greetings in the markets, and that people call out to them: Sir, Sir!
And as for you, do not call your master, for one is your Teacher—the Christ—and you are all brothers.
And do not call for yourselves a father on the earth, for your Father is one in the heavens.
And do not call anyone teachers, for your Teacher is one, the Messiah.
The greatest among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to the scribes and Pharisees.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore, you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel over land and sea to make a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind leaders! Those who say: "Whoever swears by the temple is nothing," but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound.
O fools and the blind! Which is greater: gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
Whoever swears by the slaughterhouse is not bound, but whoever swears by the sacrifice upon which he commits himself is bound.
O fools and the blind! Which is greater: the sacrifice or the altar that sanctifies the sacrifice?
Whoever swears by the altar has sworn by it and by everything upon it!
And whoever swears by the Temple has sworn by it and by its inhabitant.
And whoever swears by the sky has sworn by the Throne of Allah and the One sitting upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithes of mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. These ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
O blind leaders! Who describe the mosquito and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that also the outside may be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
So you too: outwardly you appear righteous to people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
And you say: If we had been in our fathers' days, we would not have shared with them in the blood of the prophets.
You bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of the killers of the prophets.
So fill yourselves with your fathers' measure.
O lives, children of snakes! How do you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, I am sending to you prophets, wise men, and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
So that may come upon you every pure blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Truly I tell you: all this will come upon this generation! Jesus laments over Jerusalem
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
For I tell you: you will not see me from now on until you say: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
Signs of the End Times
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them and said: "Behold! Let no one deceive you."
For many will come in my name, saying: I am the Christ! and will deceive many.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See, do not be alarmed. For all these must happen, but the end is not yet.
For one nation rises against another, and one kingdom against another, and famines, plagues, and earthquakes occur in certain places.
But all of these are the beginning of the pains.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
And then many will stumble, and some will betray and hate each other.
Many false prophets will come and deceive many.
And due to the abundance of sin, the love of many will grow cold.
But the one who endures to the end, this one will be saved.
He preaches the gospel of the kingdom in all the inhabited world as a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
So when you see the "abomination of desolation" spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place—let the reader understand—
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains,
And the one on the roof who does not come down to take something from his house,
And the one in the field should not turn back to retrieve his clothes.
Woe to the pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
They have come so that your escape is not in winter or on a Saturday.
For then there will be great distress such as has not happened since the beginning of the world until now—and never will.
And if those days had not been shortened, the body would not have been saved. But for the elect's sake, those days are shortened.
Then if anyone says to you: "Here is the Christ," or "There," do not believe.
For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
I have already told you.
If they say to you: "Here he is in the wilderness!" do not go out. "Here he is in the secret chambers!" do not believe.
For just as lightning comes out of the east and appears to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For where the corpse is, there the vultures gather.
And immediately after the hardship of those days, the sun darkens, the moon does not give its light, the stars fall from the sky, and the heavenly hosts shake.
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Then He sends His angels with a great trumpet sound, gathering His chosen ones from the four winds, from the farthest parts of the heavens to their farthest extent.
From the fig tree, you learn the parable: when its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
So you also, when you see all this, know that it is near the doors.
Truly I say to you: this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Constant readiness
And no one knows about that day and that hour, not even the angels of the heavens, except My Father alone.
And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also at the coming of the Son of Man.
For just as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
And they did not know until the flood came and took all of them; so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then there will be two in the field; one is taken and the other is left.
Two are grinding on the millstone, one is taken and the other is left.
Stay awake, for you do not know at what hour your Lord will come.
And know this: if the Lord of the house knew at which part of the night the thief would come, he would stay awake and not let his house be broken into.
Therefore, be also ready, because at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come. Like the faithful servant
So who is the trustworthy, wise servant whom his master appointed to serve them and give them food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing this!
Truly I tell you: he will judge him over all his possessions.
But if the miserable servant says in his heart: My master is delaying his arrival.
He begins to beat his servant companions and eats and drinks with the drunkards.
The master of that servant comes on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
He cuts it and shares his portion with the hypocrites. There, it is a place of crying and grinding teeth.
Like the ten virgins
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise women, and five were ignorant.
As for the ignorant women, they took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
And the wise women took oil in their vessels along with their lamps.
And while the groom was slow, all of them fell asleep and slept.
At midnight there was a cry: Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!
Then all those maidens got up and made their lamps ready.
The ignorant women said to the wise women: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
The wise women replied: Perhaps it is not enough for us, but go to the sellers and buy it yourself.
And as they were going to anoint her, the bridegroom came, and the prepared women entered with him into the wedding, and the door was closed.
Finally, the other virgins also came, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us!
He replied and said: Truly I tell you, I do not know you.
So stay awake, because you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Parable of the talents
As if a traveling man called his servants and entrusted them with his wealth.
So one gave five shekels, another two shekels, and another one shekel. Each according to their ability. And he traveled in due time.
So the one who took the five weights and traded with them, earned another five weights.
And so, the one who took the two weights also gained two more weights.
And the one who took the weight went away, dug into the ground, and hid his master's silver.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves came and held them accountable.
Then the one who took the five talents came and presented five more talents, saying: "Lord, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained five more."
His master said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.
Then the one who took the two weights came and said: O sir, two weights have been delivered to me. Here are two more weights, I have gained from them.
His master said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.
Then also came the one who took the one measure and said: O master, I knew that you are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
So I feared and went away, hiding your weight on the earth. Behold, this is what belongs to you.
And his master replied to him: "O wicked servant and sluggard, I know that you harvest where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered."
So I should have deposited my silver with the money changers; when I came, I was taking what was mine with interest.
Take from him the weight and give it to the one who has ten weights.
For everyone who has, it will be given, and they will have an abundance; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
And the brave servant was thrown into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the goats.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
All the peoples gather before him, distinguishing some from others as a shepherd distinguishes sheep from goats.
The sheep are on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right: Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.
Naked, you clothed me. Sick, you visited me. Imprisoned, you came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?"
And whenever we saw you as a stranger, we sheltered you, or as naked, we clothed you?
And when we see you sick or imprisoned, shall we come to you?
The king then responds to them: "Truly I tell you: because you did it to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me."
Then he also says to those on the left: Go away from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels.
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. I was thirsty, and you did not give me water.
I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me. Naked, and you did not clothe me. Sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer, saying: Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not serve You?
He replies to them: "Truly I tell you: whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
Then they will go to eternal punishment, and the righteous to eternal life.
Conspiracy to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples:
You know that in two days is Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people gathered at the house of the high priest called Caiaphas.
And they conspired to seize Jesus secretly and kill Him.
But they said: "There is no celebration so that there may be no riot among the people." He poured perfume on Jesus.
And while Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman approached him with a very expensive bottle, and she poured it over his head while he was leaning back.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying: "Why this waste?"
Because this good could have been sold for a lot and given to the poor.
Then Jesus knew and said to them: "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for me!
For the poor are with you at all times, but I am not with you at all times.
For when I pour this perfume on my body, I do it only to suffice myself.
Truly I tell you: where this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her." Judas's betrayal
Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said: "What do you want to give me so I can hand it over to you?" So they gave him thirty thousand silver coins.
Since that time, he was seeking an opportunity to hand him over. The Passover dinner with the disciples
On the first day of the Feast, the disciples approached Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said: "Go to the city, to so-and-so, and tell him: The teacher says: My time is near. You have to make the most of my speech with my students."
So the students did as Jesus commanded and prepared the Passover.
And when evening came, he reclined with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said: "Truly I tell you: one of you will betray me."
They were very sad, and each one of them began to ask him: "Am I the one, Lord?"
He replied and said: "The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me!"
The Son of Man is going as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!
Judas, his servant, replied: "Am I he, my lord?" He said to him: "You have said." The Lord's Supper
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying: "Take and eat. This is my body."
He took the cup, thanked, and gave it to them, saying: "Drink from it, all of you,"
For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you: I will not drink from the fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they worshipped Him and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial of Him.
Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will stumble this night, for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered."
But after I rise, I will go before you to the Galilee.
Peter answered him, "Even if all are made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
Jesus said to him: "Truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" Likewise, all the disciples said the same. In Gethsemane.
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here until I go over there and pray."
Then Peter, James, and John took with him, and he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
He said to them: "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."
Then he moved forward a little and fell on his face, and he was praying, saying: "O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; but not as I will, but as You will."
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Then he went away again and prayed, saying: "Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he came and found them also sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
So he left them and went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them: "Now, rest and sleep! Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners."
Let's go, let's go! Behold, the one who is delivering me has come near!». The arrest of Jesus
And as he was speaking, Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, came with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
And the one who handed him over gave them a sign saying: "The one I accept is him. Hold him."
Immediately he approached Jesus and said, "Peace, my Lord!" and kissed Him.
Jesus said to him: "Friend, why have you come?" Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and seized Him.
And one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him: "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword!"
Do you think I cannot now ask my father, and he will give me more than twelve armies of angels?
So how do you complete the books: that it should be like this?
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds: "As if on a thief you have come out with swords and clubs to seize me! Every day I sat with you teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me."
And all of this was so that the books of the prophets would be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Before the Jewish council
And those who seized Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders gathered.
And Peter followed him from a distance to the house of the high priest, and went inside and sat with the servants to see the outcome.
And the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus to put him to death,
They did not find it. And although many false witnesses came, they did not find it. But finally, a false witness came forward.
They said: "He said: I can destroy the temple of God, and in three days I will rebuild it."
Then the high priest stood up and said to him: "Do you have nothing to answer? What do these testify against you?"
And Jesus remained silent. The high priest then asked him, "I charge you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Jesus said to him: "You said it! And I also tell you: From now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said: "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy!"
What do you see?». They replied and said: «He deserves death».
Then they spat in his face, punched him, and others kicked him.
Saying: "Prophesy to us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter's denial
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean!"
He denied in front of everyone, saying: "I do not know what you are saying!"
Then, when he went out into the courtyard, another saw him and said to those there, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
He also denied by swearing: "I do not know the man!".
And after a while, the men came and said to Peter: "Truly you are also one of them, for your language shows it!"
Then he began to curse and swear: "I do not know the man!" And immediately, the rooster crowed.
So Peter remembered the words of Jesus who said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Then he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself
And when morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people conferred against Jesus to put him to death,
They tied him up, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the Roman governor.
Then, when Judah the one who betrayed him saw that he was condemned, he regretted it and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said: «I have erred in handing over an innocent blood.» They replied: «What is it to us? You are more perceptive!»
He threw the word into the temple and left, then went and suffocated himself.
The chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put it into the treasury because it is the price of blood."
They consulted and bought with it the Fakhari field, a graveyard for strangers.
That is why that field is called "Blood Field" to this day.
Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "And they took thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued,
And they gave her from the Fakhari field, as the Lord commanded me. Before Pilate
Jesus then stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You say so."
And while the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he did not answer anything.
Pilate said to him: "Don't you hear how many witnesses testify against you?"
He did not respond to him or to a single word, until the governor was very surprised.
The governor was accustomed during Eid to release one prisoner to the crowd, whoever they wanted.
And at that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
While they were assembled, Pilate said to them: "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Because he knew they handed him over out of envy.
And while he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent to him saying: "Beware of that drunkard, for I suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.
The governor replied to them: "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said: "Barabbas!"
Pilate asked them: "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah?" All of them answered: "Crucify him!"
The governor said: "And what evil deed?" They kept shouting louder: "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that nothing was going to help, but rather a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying: "I am innocent of this man's blood! See for yourselves!"
All the people answered and said: "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and handed over to be crucified. Mockery by the soldiers
The governor's army took Jesus to the governor's house and gathered all the battalion around him.
They tore him apart and dressed him in a crimson robe.
They wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. They knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, took the cane, and struck him on the head.
And after they mocked him, they took off his cloak, put his clothes on him, and led him to crucifixion. Crucifixion
And as they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry his cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which is called "the place of the skull"
They gave him a mixture blended with bitterness to drink. And when he tasted it, he did not want to drink.
And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots for them, to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots."
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they wrote above his head the reason: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Then two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
And the passersby would mock him while shaking their heads.
Saying: "O breaker and builder of the temple in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
And also the chief priests, when they mocked with the scribes and the elders, said:
Others have finished, but he himself cannot save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
Rely on God; let Him save you now if He wishes! For He said: I am the Son of God!».
And thus also the two thieves who were crucified with him reproached him. Death
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Around nine o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice: "Eli, Eli, why have you forsaken me?" which means: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
A group of those standing there, upon hearing it, said: "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with honey, placed it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
And the remaining ones said: "Leave him. Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave up His spirit.
And when the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves opened, and many of the bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose.
And they came out of the graves after His resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
And as for the captain of the hundred and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and what had happened, they were very afraid and said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve Him.
Among them are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children. The burial
And when evening came, a wealthy man from Ramah named Joseph arrived, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
Then he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate then ordered that the body be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in pure linen.
And he placed him in his new tomb that he had carved into the rock, then rolled a large stone over the tomb's entrance and went away.
And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
And the next day, after preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate.
Saying: "O Lord, you reminded us that that misguided one said while alive: I will rise after three days."
He passed by and checked the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples would not come at night and steal him, and say to the people: He has risen from the dead, and then the last deception would be worse than the first!
Pilate said to them: "You have guards. Go and secure him as you know."
So they went and secured the tomb with guards and sealed the stone.
The Resurrection
And after Saturday, at dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb.
And when a great earthquake occurs, because the angel of the Lord descends from heaven, comes, rolls away the stone from the door, and sits on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
Because of his fear, the guards trembled and became like the dead.
The angel answered and said to the women: "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus the crucified."
He is not here, because he has risen as he said! Come, let us see the place where the Lord was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples: He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Behold, I have told you.
They quickly left the grave, filled with great fear and joy, running to inform His disciples.
As they were on their way to inform their disciples, Jesus met them and said, "Peace be with you." They approached, grasped his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards' words
And as they were going, some of the guards came to the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
So they gathered with the elders, consulted together, and gave the army a lot of silver.
Saying: "Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while we were sleeping."
And if the governor hears of this, we will plead with him, and make you all reassured.
They took the silver and did as they were instructed, and this saying became widespread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to the disciples
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
And when they saw him, they prostrated to him, but some of them doubted.
Then Jesus came and spoke to them, saying: "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth,"
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to preserve all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age. Amen.
John the Baptist prepares the way
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you."
A loud voice in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the Jewish towns and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and all of them relied on him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
And John was wearing camel's hair clothing, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he preached, saying: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The baptism of Jesus Christ and His temptation
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And at that moment, as he was ascending from the water, he saw the heavens torn apart, and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
And the voice from the heavens: "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
And at that moment, the Spirit led him out into the wilderness.
And there in the wilderness, he spent forty days being tested by Satan. He was with the beasts. And the angels began to serve him. The call of the first disciples
And after John had baptized, Jesus came to Galilee to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom of God.
And he says: "The time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near; repent and believe in the gospel."
As he was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately, they left their window and followed him.
Then he passed from there a little and saw Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John, they were in the boat repairing the nets.
He called them for the time. So they left their father Zubdi in the boat with the rowers and went after him. A wicked spirit was expelled.
Then they entered Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were struck with awe at his teaching because he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.
And there was in their assembly a man with an unclean spirit, so he cried out
Saying: "Ah! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You who You are: the Holy One of God!"
Then Jesus rebuked him, saying: "Be quiet! Come out of him!"
He struck the impure soul and cried out with a loud voice, and it came out of him.
They all were amazed, until some of them asked each other, saying: "What is this? What is this new teaching? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!"
His news spread throughout the surrounding region of the Great, including Shifa Hama of Simon and others.
And when they left the synagogue, they went to Simon and Andrew's house with James and John.
And Simaan's mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and they immediately informed him about her.
He advanced and held her upright with his hand, so the fever immediately left her, and she began to serve them.
And when evening came, as the sun set, all the sick and the insane were brought to him.
And the entire city was gathered at the door.
He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons, not allowing the demons to speak because they knew him. The proclamation in Galilee
Early in the morning, he got up, went out, and headed to an open place, where he would pray.
Then Simon followed him, and those with him.
When they found him, they said to him: "Everyone is seeking you."
He said to them: "Let us go to the neighboring towns also, so that I may preach there as well; for this is why I have come out."
He preached in their synagogues throughout Galilee and cast out demons. He healed a leper.
Then a leper came to him, kneeling and saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was moved with compassion, reached out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to; be clean."
Immediately, as he spoke, the leper went away from him and was cleansed.
So he scolded him and sent him away for the time being.
And he said to him: "Look, do not tell anyone anything, but go yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
As for him, he went out and began to call out loudly and spread the news, to the point that he could no longer enter the city openly; he was staying outside in deserted places, and people would come to him from all directions.
Healing of the paralyzed
Then he entered Capernaum again after a few days, and heard that he was in the house.
And immediately, many gathered until there was no room left, not even around the door. He was addressing them with a word.
And they came to him, bringing a paralyzed man carried by four.
And when they were unable to get close to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. After they had made a hole, they lowered the bed on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And a group of scribes there were sitting, pondering in their hearts:
Why does he speak like this with blasphemy? Who can forgive sins except God alone?
Immediately Jesus felt in his spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves, and he said to them: «Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise, take up your bed, and walk"?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," He said to the paralytic:
I tell you: Get up, carry your bed, and go to your house!
He immediately got up, carried the bed, and went out before everyone, so that all were amazed and praised God, saying: "We have never seen anything like this!" The calling of Levi
Then he also went out to the sea. And all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
As he was passing by, Levi son of Alphaeus saw him sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me." So he got up and followed him.
While he was reclining in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were also reclining with Jesus and his disciples, because they were many and they followed him.
And the scribes and Pharisees, when they saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The question about fasting
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, so they came and asked him: "Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but your disciples do not?"
Jesus said to them: "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast."
But there will come days when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast during those days.
No one patches a new piece onto an old garment, or else the new will take from the old and the tear will become worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, lest the new wine burst the wineskins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins. Rabbi Saturday
And he passed through the fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they went.
The Pharisees said to him: "Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
He said to them: "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry and thirsty, he and those with him?"
How did he enter the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the bread of the offering that is not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and also gave to those who were with him.
Then He said to them: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Indeed, the son of man is also the Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Then he also entered the assembly, and there was a man whose hand was withered.
They started watching him: Will he heal on Saturday? So they can accuse him.
He said to the man whose hand is paralyzed: "Stand in the middle!".
Then he said to them: "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill?" They remained silent.
He looked around at them angrily, saddened by the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man: "Extend your hand." So he extended it, and his hand returned to normal like the other.
Then the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians and conspired against Him to destroy Him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Then Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed him.
From Jerusalem, from Edom, and from across the Jordan. And those around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what He had done, came to Him.
He told his disciples to accompany him on a small boat for the purpose of gathering, so they wouldn't crowd him.
For he had healed many, so that those afflicted with various diseases would come and touch him.
And the holy spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying: "You are the Son of God!"
And he advised them many times not to reveal it. The Selection of the Twelve Apostles
Then he ascended the mountain and called the ones he wanted, and they went to him.
And He appointed twelve to be with Him, and to send them out to preach,
And they will have authority to heal diseases and cast out demons.
And He made Simon's name Peter.
And Yaqub ibn Zubayd and Yohanan, the brother of Yaqub, and he gave them the name Buanarjis, meaning "sons of thunder."
Andreas, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
And Judas Iscariot who betrayed him. Then they came to the house. Jesus and Beelzebul
So they gathered together until they couldn't even eat bread.
When his relatives heard, they went out to seize him, because they said: "He is mentally ill!".
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said: "He has Beelzebul! And by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons."
Then he called them and said to them in parables: "How can a devil cast out a devil?"
And if a kingdom divides itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house divides itself against itself, that house cannot stand.
