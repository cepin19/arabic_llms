The chapter does not specify the chosen one in the kingdom of the heavens?
At that time, the disciples came near Jesus and asked him: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" Luke 22:24
And he shouted to Jesus for a little child and stood him among them.
And he said: "I tell you the truth: unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Mark
And whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the most deserving in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomes someone like this in my name, welcomes me.
And the one who falls into sins is one of those little ones who believe in him; for him, it is better to hang a large millstone around his neck and be thrown into the sea.
Woe to the people of the world from the matters that cause sins! Because these things must happen, but woe to the one who causes them!
Otherwise, your hand or your leg will fall into sin; cut them off and throw them at yourself, because it's better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot, rather than having two hands or two feet and falling into eternal damnation. When
Otherwise, your eye will lead you into sin, gouge it out and throw it away from you, because it's better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 The blind sheep
You are deporting one of these little ones, because I tell you: their angels in heaven always accompany those in heaven.
The path of a human's son is to save the people who have performed ablution. # 18.11 This verse is not found in many old manuscripts.
What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them gets sick, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go look for the sick sheep?
I tell you the truth: if he finds him, he will be happier than his own joy with the 90s and the 90s that he didn't perform the ablution for.
And so, the one in the sky doesn't want any of these little ones to be harmed. The brother who is guilty
Except for your brother's sin against you, go to him and dispute only between you and him; if he listens to you, you will have gained your brother.
Otherwise, he doesn't want to listen; you have one or two with you so that every word is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Otherwise, he doesn't want to listen to them; tell it to the people of the church, or if he doesn't want to listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth: everything you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and everything you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
And I tell you again: if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
Because wherever two or three gather in my name, I am there among them." The example of the servant who does not forgive.
And Peter drew near to Jesus and asked him, "Lord! How many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?" Luke
And Jesus said to him: "Not just seven times, but seventy times seven times."
Regarding this, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he started to be held accountable with them, they brought him one who owed him millions of silver dirhams.
And since he had nothing to repay him with, he ordered his master to sell him, his wife, his children, and everything he owned to settle the debt he owed.
And the servant prostrated to him and said: Be patient, my master, and I will repay you everything I owe.
And his lady felt sorry for him, divorced him, and forgave him for the debt he owed.
And when that servant left, he found one of the slaves, his companion, who was asking him for a hundred dirhams of silver. He seized him, hanged him, and said: Return to me what I was asking you for!
His friend fell at his feet, begging him, and he said to him: Be patient, and I will return to you what is owed.
But he didn't want to, so he took him and threw him in prison until he paid the debt he owed.
And when the slaves saw their master, they were very sad and went to tell their master everything that had happened.
And his master yells at him and says: "Oh, this servant who is no good! I forgave you for all that debt because you begged me,"
So why didn't you show mercy to your servant, your friend, as I have shown mercy to you?
And Lady is worried, she sends her to prison to punish him until he returns what he owes.
This way, he will do for you what is in the sky unless he forgives each of you from his heart.
Chapter 19: Jesus teaches about divorce
And when Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
And many groups of people followed him, and they were healed.
They brought him closer to the Pharisees and asked him to test him: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife, as long as there is a reason?"
And he answers them and says: "Did you not read in the Book of Allah that Allah created mankind from a male and a female,"
He said: That's why the man will stay with his wife and be faithful, and they will become one flesh.
And so they will no longer be two, but only one. And what God has united, no man can separate.
The Pharisees asked him: "And why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?" Matthew
And Jesus answered them: "It is because of the hardness of your hearts that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but this was not the case when God created Adam and Eve in the beginning."
I am telling you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than unfaithfulness and marries another, he commits adultery. Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
And his students told him: "If this is a man's situation with a woman, it's better for him not to marry at all."
And Jesus answered them: "Not everyone accepts this message, only those whom God has blessed to accept it."
Because there are people who were born from their mothers' wombs and are unable to marry, and there are those whom people have turned away like that. And there are those who do not marry for the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can understand this, let him understand it." Jesus blesses the little children
People brought him some young children so he could lay his hands on them and pray with them, and the students argued over who brought them.
But Jesus said: "Let the children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he put his hands on them and then walked away. The young man who is dressed in it
A young man came to him and said: "O master, what good deed can I do to have eternal life?"
And Jesus answered him: "Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
He asks him: «What are the commandments?» and Jesus replies: «Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
Be patient with yourself and others, and wish for what is close to you as you wish for yourself.
And the young man says to him: "I've done all these recommendations, so what else do I need?"
And Jesus answered him: "If you want to be perfect, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me!"
But as soon as the young man heard this, he left feeling sad because he was in very good health.
And Jesus said to his disciples: "I tell you the truth: it is difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And I keep telling you: entering the camel through the eye of the needle is easier than entering the one who is righteous into the kingdom of God!
And they were very surprised when they heard this speech and said: "On this account, who can be saved?"
And Jesus saw them and said to them: "People cannot do this, but God is able to do everything."
And Peter replied and said: "Here we have left everything and followed you, what will be our reward?"
And Jesus told them: "I tell you the truth: when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne in the time when everything will be renewed, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel." Matthew
Whoever permits his wife, nor his brothers, nor his sisters, nor his father, nor his mother, nor his children, nor his land to be taken before my name, then he will have to answer for what he permitted a hundred times, and the eternal life with God will be changed for him.
Many of those who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first. Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: Examples of Servants in the Vine Gardens
The way to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man who has a vineyard; he went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
And he gave them a dinar for the day and sent them to his gardens.
And he went out at nine in the morning and found other workers standing in the market without work.
And he tells them: Go until you reach my gardens, and I will pay you for what you deserve.
And he went out. Then he went out again inside the daytime, and he went out again at three in the afternoon, and he added more workers.
And he went out once in the evening at five o'clock, and he found other workers standing and he said to them: Why are you standing here all day without work?
And they answered him: because no one has worked for him. And he told them: Well, go until you reach my gardens.
And when evening came, the owner of the gardens told his agent: Call all the workers and give them their wages, starting from the last until you reach the first.
And those who hated him at five in the evening came and each of them took a dinar.
And when the first ones arrived, he told them they would be paid at a higher price, but they also only took one dinar each.
And when they got paid, they started complaining about the landlord.
And they say: those others only worked for one hour and got paid in full, while we are the ones working all day in the sun.
And he responds to the owner of the shop, one of them, and he says to him: I didn't cheat you, my friend, did I agree with you on a dinar?
Well, take your right and go your way! And this is what came at the end, I wanted to give it to you like you.
Don't I have the right to manage my money as I want? Or am I cursed because I'm generous?
And Jesus added: "So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus prophesies for the third time about his death and mission.
And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took aside his disciples, the inattentive ones, by themselves and said to them on the way:
Here we are going up to Jerusalem, and behind us someone is going to deliver the Son of Man to the leaders of the religious men and the scholars of the law, and they will judge him to death.
And he will hand him over to those who do not know God, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will be sent from death." Mother Jacob and John ask Jesus for their children.
Mother of Zubaydi's wife and her children came to Jesus, and she worshipped Him and asked Him to do her a favor.
He asked her: "What do you want?" and she told him: "Order them to sit both of my children, one on your right and the other on your left in your kingdom."
And Jesus replied to them: "You do not know what you are asking, can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" They said to him: "Yes, we can!"
And he told them: "Honestly, you will drink the glass, but the glass on my right and my left is not mine to give, because it will only be given to those who have prepared for them."
And when the ten disciples heard this, they were very worried about Jacob and his brother John.
Jesus called out to them and said: "You know that the rulers lord it over the people, and the officials flaunt their authority over those under them." Luke
And this should not be between you. But whoever wants to be great among you, must become your servant. When
And whoever wants to be the first among you must become your servant.
Thus, man was not born to be served by others, but to serve and sacrifice himself for many people. Jesus heals two blind men.
And when they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and they heard that Jesus was passing by, so they began to shout and say: "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
And even if people argue with them to make them be quiet, they shout even more and say: "Have mercy on us, O Lord, O Son of David!".
And Jesus stood up and shouted to them and asked: "What do you want me to do for you?"
And they answered him: "We want our eyes to be opened, sir!".
And Jesus had compassion on them, and their eyes were opened, and they began to see, as they followed Him.
Chapter twenty-one: Jesus enters Jerusalem
And when they approached Jerusalem and reached the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples.
He told them: "Go to the square in front of you, behind you you'll find a tied donkey, with a cart attached, untie them and bring them to me."
Otherwise, tell someone something, tell him: The Lord needs them, just bring them quickly.
And all this happened to fulfill the words of the Prophet who said:
Tell Zion's daughter: Here is your king coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and the foal of a donkey.
And the students went together and did what Jesus commanded them to do.
They brought the donkeys and the carts, put their belongings on them, and Jesus mounted on top of them.
And a large group of people spread their belongings on the road, and others cut down tree branches and spread them on the road.
And the groups of people who preceded Jesus and those who followed him shout and say: "Glory # 21:9 Glory. Literally: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Glory to God in the highest heaven!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city’s inhabitants were disturbed and began to say: "Who is this?"
And the groups of people responded to them: "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus runs after the sellers and buyers from the house of God.
And Jesus entered the house of God and drove out those who were selling and buying, overturning the tables of the money changers and the chairs of the dove sellers.
And he told them: "You are writing in God's book that the house will be called the house of prayer, but you have turned it into a den of thieves!"
And some blind and lame people came to him at the House of God, and he healed them.
But the heads of religious men and scholars of the law were troubled when they saw the miracles Jesus performed, and when they heard the children shouting in the house of God and saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David!".
And they said to him: "Do you hear what they are saying?" Jesus answered them and said: "Yes, have you never read in the book of God: Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have perfected praise?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he stayed there. Jesus cursed the fig tree.
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, hunger came to him.
And he sees a vine on the side of the road, and he goes to it but finds nothing on it except the leaves. And Jesus says to it: "The fruit will never be in you forever!" And at that moment, the vine withered.
When the students saw what happened, they were amazed and said: "How did the vine dry so quickly?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Truly I tell you: if you have faith and do not doubt, you will do only what I did to the vine, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Move and fall into the sea,' it will happen as I said."
"Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive." Who gave authority to Jesus?
When Jesus came to the house of God to teach there, the leaders of the religious men and the elders of the people came to him and said: "By what authority do you do this? And who gave you this authority?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Even I want to ask you a question, and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do this:"
Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from God or from people?». And they discussed among themselves and said: «If it is from God, He will tell us: why did you not believe in John?
Otherwise, they tell us it came from the people; we fear the people because they think John is a prophet.
And they answer Jesus and say to him: "We do not know." And he says to them: "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons.
A man told me that he had two children, and he went to the first one and said to him: "Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard."
His son replied to him and said: I don't want to. But he regretted in the end and left.
And Bou went to the second boy and said to him as he said to the first, and he replied to him and said: "Yes, sir!" but he did not go.
So, who among these two did Murad Bah do?». And they told him: «The first». And Jesus said to them: «I tell you the truth: tax collectors and sinners will precede you into the kingdom of God.
John # 21:32 Here, John the Baptist is meant. He came to you following the way of truth, and you did not believe in him, but tax collectors and sinners believed in him. And even after seeing this, you did not regret it nor believe in him. Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parable of the vineyard and the vineyard workers
They heard another example: this man has land, planted vineyards, built a wall around it, dug a press, and constructed a tower, then sold some of the land and traveled.
And when the time comes to harvest the grapes, he sends his slaves to the vineyards to collect his crop.
They went to the gardens, captured the slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned another with stones.
And he kept sending other servants more than the first, and the gardeners treated them the same way they treated the others.
And finally, he sent his son to them and said: They will respect my son.
But when they saw the son of the garden, the son of paradise, they said among themselves: This is the one who will show us! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!
And they praised him and took him out to the vineyards of grapes and killed him.
Well, if the owner of the grape gardens comes, what does he need to do for those gardens?
And they replied to him: "Those mischievous ones will have a bad ending in the end, and they will give the bunches of grapes to other vineyard owners who will harvest the crop in due time."
And Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Book of God: the stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes!"
Regarding this, I tell you: the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
And the one who fell on this stone will be crushed, and the one the stone fell on will be shattered.
And when they heard the heads of the religious men and the Pharisees speaking about him, they understood that he was talking about them.
And they started looking for ways to arrest him, but they were afraid of the groups of people because they considered him a prophet.
Chapter twenty-two: The example of the wedding procession
And Jesus spoke again to the crowd of people and said:
It is like the kingdom of heaven, which is like a king who held a wedding for his son.
So he sent his servants to call those who were invited, but they refused to come.
And he kept sending other servants and told them: Tell the invitees: I have prepared the wedding, slaughtered the fattened calves and the fat cows, and everything is ready. So come to the wedding!
But they didn't treat it for him; some of them went out to their farmland, and others went to buy and sell.
And two other men from those presented seized his slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
And the king worries, sends his army, and destroys those killers and burns their city.
And he says to his slaves: The wedding is here, but those we offered it to do not deserve it.
So now go to where the roads meet and invite everyone you find to the wedding.
And the slaves went out to the streets and gathered everything they found, neither the good people nor the bad, until the house was filled with guests.
And when the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man not dressed in wedding clothes.
And he says to him: "How did you do, my friend, that you came here and you're not wearing the wedding clothes?" The man remained silent because he had nothing to say.
And the king says to his servants: Throw him from his hands and feet and cast him out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. When
Many have been exposed, but few are chosen. The tax payment to Caesar.
And the Pharisees at that time were consulting among themselves to catch Jesus in some mistake in his words.
And they send their students to him with the Herodians and say to him: "Sir, we know that you are honest, and you teach the way of God in truth, and you do not regard anyone's face, for it does not matter to you what people think."
So tell us, what do you think? Should we pay the tax to Caesar or not?
And Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them: "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the money so I can pay the tax!». And they gave him a dinar.
And he asked them: "This picture and this writing on the money, whose are they?"
He told them: "It belongs to Caesar!" and he said to them: "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's!"
When they heard it, they were amazed, left it, and went away. The question is about the burial of the dead.
A delegation came to Jesus, some of the Sadducees who believe that the dead are not resurrected, and they asked him: the works
Oh sir, Musa said: If a man dies and leaves children, his brother must marry his wife so that he can have children in his brother's name.
We had seven brothers, the first one got married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother so he could marry her.
And so it happened to the second, the third, up to the seventh.
And finally, after they all died, the woman also died.
So, who among these seven will be the man of this woman on the day of the sending? Because they were all her men.
And Jesus answered and said to them: "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God."
Because on the Day of Sending, people will not marry nor will they be married, but they will be like angels in the sky.
As for the matter of burying the dead, didn't you read God's words to you when He said:
Am I not the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead but of the living.
And when the groups of people heard this talk, they were amazed by his teaching. The great advice
And when the Pharisees heard the report that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, who was among the scholars of Sharia, asked Jesus to test him and said:
Sir, what is the great commandment in the law?
And Jesus answered and said to him: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the great and first inheritance.
And the second advice is the same: love those who are close to you as you love yourself.
And on these two commandments, the entire law and the prophets are built. Luke 10:25-28 Christ and the prophet David
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
Are you talking about Christ? Who is he? They answered: "Son of David!".
And he asks them: "So how was David, by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, when the Lord called him?"
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.
So, if David calls upon the Lord Jesus, how can Jesus be his son?
And not a single person dared to answer him with a word, nor did anyone from that day claim to ask him other questions.
Chapter twenty-three: Jesus advises his disciples to be cautious of the religious leaders and the Pharisees
And Jesus spoke with the crowds of people and with his disciples.
He said: "The scholars of the law and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses,"
Well, everything they tell you, do it and follow it, but don't do what they do because they don't do what they say.
They pack bundles of sayings and difficulties in the bag and put them on people's shoulders, but they don't even move a finger to lift them with them.
Otherwise, they do something just so people can see them, and they expand their gangs in their arms and chests, and they lengthen their braids.
And they want to be in the best places at parties, and the first places in prayer rooms.
People in the street like to greet them and call out to them: Sir.
But don't let anyone call you: Sir, because you are all brothers and have only one master.
And no one in this world is called by you as "Bakkam," because you have one father, who is the Father in the heavens.
And don't let anyone call you: Oh teacher, because you have only one teacher, Christ.
And especially the elder among you should be your servant. When
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to do so.
But woe to you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You eat the bread of the humble and prolong your prayers just to be seen; because of this, your punishment will be harsher than that of others.] # 23:14 This verse is not found in many old manuscripts.
Woe to you, oh scholars of the law and the hypocritical Pharisees! Because you cut off the land and the sea to bring back a single Jew, and when he becomes a Jew, you send him to hell—more than you deserve, twice over!
Woe to you, O deep officials! You say that anyone who swears by the House of God is not accepted, but whoever swears by the gold of the House of God must fulfill his oath.
Oh, this madness and blindness! Isn't Hassan, gold, or the House of God, which returns gold, sacred?
And he also said: Whoever swore by the slaughterhouse, his oath is not accepted, but whoever swore by the gift above him, he must fulfill his oath.
Oh, these blind ones! Why, is it better? The sacrifice, or the slaughterhouse that makes the sacrifice sacred?
Because whoever swears by the slaughterhouse swears by it and everything above it.
And he who swore by God's house swears by it and by God, the one who resides in it.
And he who swears by the sky, swears by the throne of God and even by God Himself who is above it. Matthew 5:34
Woe to you, oh scholars of the law and the hypocritical Pharisees! You tithe on mint, dill, and cumin, while neglecting the important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faith. You should have done these things without neglecting the others.
Oh, these corrupt officials! You are draining the water from the mosquito but poisoning the camel.
Woe to you, oh scholars of the law and the hypocritical Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but leave the inside full of theft and greed.
Oh, this Pharisee's blindness! Clean the cup and the dish from the inside first, so that they may also be clean on the outside.
Woe to you, O scholars of the law and the hypocritical Pharisees! You are like painted tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are filled with dead bones and everything unclean. deeds
Thus, until I die, people will see you from the outside as fearing God, but from within, you are full of hypocrisy and sins.
Woe to you, O scholars of the law and the hypocritical Pharisees! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the gardens of the righteous.
And they say: If we had lived during our ancestors' time, we would not have participated in the killing of the prophets.
And thus you testify against yourselves that you are the children of those prophets who were killed.
Yeah, finish what your ancestors started.
Oh this Hanash, the Lifa'i trickster! How will you manage until you escape the torment of Hell? When
Regarding that, I will send you the prophets, the judges, and the scholars of the Sharia, some of whom you will kill and some will be crucified, and some will be beaten in your prayer houses and chased from city to city.
So that the punishment for every bloodshed on the ground may descend upon you: the blood of Abel, who was faithful to God, until the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
I tell you the truth: all this punishment will fall upon this generation! Jesus' love for Jerusalem
Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem! The one who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her. How many times I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
And here is your house, it will remain a ruin for you.
And I tell you: you will no longer see me until you say: "Congratulations to what is coming in the name of the Lord."
Chapter twenty-four: Jesus predicts that the temple of God will be destroyed
And Jesus went out and walked to the house of God, and his disciples came to him to show him the children of the house of God.
And Jesus said to them: "Have you seen all this? I tell you the truth: not one stone here will remain on top of another, it will all be torn down." Signs of the end times
And when Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him and asked him among themselves and him: "Tell us, Lord, when will this happen? And what is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
And Jesus answers them and says: "Be careful that no one deceives you!"
Because many people will come and take my name and say: I am the Messiah! and many people will be mistaken.
And you will hear about war and news of war, and you will be terrified! Because all of this must happen, but this will not be the end of times.
Because a people will attack a people, and a kingdom will attack a kingdom, hunger will come, and earthquakes will strike many places.
But all of this is just the Bedouins of pain.
At that time, they will hand you over to those who will torture and kill you. All the peoples of the world will hate you because of my name. When
At that time, many people returned to their faith, betrayed each other, and hated one another.
And they deceive many of the false prophets and mislead many people.
And because of many sins, the love of many people will grow cold.
But the one who remained steadfast even in the dirt, that one is Ginja. When
And you will be informed of this good news of the Kingdom of God throughout the whole world, and it will be a testimony to all the peoples of the world, and at that time the end of the age will come. The great tribulation
And whenever you see in the holy place the abomination of desolation that the prophet Daniel spoke about—who reads, understands!
That hour when in the land of the Jews they flee to the mountains,
And what is above the surface does not come down to take what is in his house. Luke
And the one who was in the field does not return to take his clothes.
Woe to the pregnant women and the women who are breastfeeding during those days.
Pray that your escape does not happen in the winter or on Saturday.
Your sacrifice, a great disaster will occur, unlike anything that has happened since the time God created the world until now, and it will never happen again. The vision
And Allah did not fall short those days; not even one person would be saved from humans, but because of those whom Allah chose those days, He will fall short.
At that very hour, someone told you: Here is Christ, or He is not! Do not believe them.
Because some people will claim and say that they are the Messiah, and others that they are prophets, and they will perform signs and strange things, in order to deceive even those whom God has chosen.
Well, I have already taught you before.
But I tell you: he is in the desert! Don't go out, or he is in the houses of the interior! Don't trust them. Luke
Just as lightning strikes in the east and appears in the west, so will be the coming of the son of man.
Wherever the carcass is, there the vultures will gather." Luke 17:37 The coming of the Son of Man
3:15; Revelation 6:12; 3:15; Revelation 6:13 «And after these days of tribulation, the sun will darken, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
At that hour, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. The vision
And he sends his angels along with a loud horn, to gather those chosen for him from the four directions from every place under the sky. The example of the vine.
And learn this example from the vine: when its branches are pruned and they become green and its leaves grow, you know that summer is near.
Until then, when you see all these things happening, know that he is coming soon, he is near the doors.
I tell you the truth: this generation won't face these issues until all these things happen.
The way of the heavens and the earth is beyond us, but my words will never benefit us. The day and the hour are unknown.
That day and that hour, no one knows them, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, except the Father alone.
Just as happened with Noah, so will be the coming of the son of man.
Because the people in the days before the flood were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark.
And they did not know what would happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is how the coming of the Son of Man will be.
At that time, there will be only two per hectare, one will be taken and the other will remain.
And there will be two women grinding grain, one will take the other and stay.
Well, stay awake, because you don't know when your Lord will come.
And you should know that if the owner of the house knew what time at night the thief would come, he would stay awake and not let him steal his house. Luke
Regarding this matter, until we are present, because a human being will come at a certain time and you won't be aware of it. The example of Al-Abd Al-Amin.
And who is the trustworthy and wise servant whom his master entrusted with the household slaves to give them food on time?
That servant, when his master arrives on time, will be found doing the work he was instructed to do.
I tell you the truth: he is going to spend everything he has.
Unless that servant is ugly and has a bad attitude: my master delays in returning.
And he started beating his slave companions, eating, and drinking with the Sukkariyah.
Ghiji Sayyid, that servant, one day he was unaware of it and at the moment he didn't know it.
And he punishes him a lot and makes him among the hypocrites. Then there will be crying and gnashing of teeth.
Chapter twenty-five: The example of the ten single women
Then at that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Luke
And five of them were crazy, and five others were sane.
And those five fools of theirs, the little frogs, without taking extra oil with them.
As for the five wise women, they took their jars and oil in the containers.
And when the groom is delayed, all the single women start gossiping until they fall asleep.
And in the middle of the night, you hear a loud voice saying: "The groom is coming, go out to meet him!"
And all the single women get up and prepare their baskets.
The wise women say: Give us some of your oil because our frogs are about to die out.
But the wise ones replied to them and said: We might not be enough for ourselves and you, go buy it from the one who sells it.
And when they were going to buy the oil, the groom arrived, and those present for the wedding scene entered with him and closed the door.
And then they returned the unmarried women to others and said: Oh sir, oh sir, open for us! Luke
But the groom replied to them and said: Honestly, I don't know you.
So stay awake about this, because you don't know neither the day nor the hour [when the son of man will come] # 25.13 The end of this verse is missing in many old manuscripts.
And the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was traveling, called his servants and entrusted them with his money, Luke. The example of the money bags.
And he gave one five bags of money, the second two, and the third one bag, each according to his ability. And he is traveling.
And that one who took five hundred dollars and started buying and selling with them, earned another five hundred dollars.
And that one who took two of the shots also won two other shots.
As for that one who took a single bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the bag his master gave him inside.
And after a long period, the master of those slaves returned and held them accountable.
And he comes to him who took five of the prayers and paid with them five other prayers, and he said: Yes, sir, you gave me five prayers, so here are the other five I won, plus.
His mistress told him: I have nothing to ask you, you are a good and trustworthy servant! You were honest with me in small things, and now I will entrust you with bigger ones. So come and rejoice with your master.
And then, the one who took two of the prayers also came and said: Yes, sir, you gave me two prayers, so here are two more I won, plus the additional ones.
His mistress told him: I have nothing to ask you, you are a good and honest servant! I was honest with myself in the little, and now I will assign you more. So come and rejoice with your master.
And then, that one who took a bag came to him and said: Sir, I know that you are a tough man, you reap what you have not sown and gather what you have not scattered.
And because of this, I was afraid and went to hide your bag in the ground, and now here is your livelihood.
And his mistress responds to him and says: "You are a wicked and lazy servant! Do you think I have been harvesting what I didn't plant and gathering what I didn't sow?"
Yeah, you should put my money with the money traders, so that when I get it back, I also get the profit.
Hide this bag and add it to the one who has ten bags.
Because whoever has will be given more and will be added to them beyond measure. And whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. When?
And this servant who is good for nothing, they threw him out into the darkness, and then there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 8:12; 22:13; Luke 13:28 The Son of Man will judge the nations.
And when the son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
And all the peoples will gather before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
And the sheep are kept on his right side, and the goats on his left side.
And then the king said to those on his right: Come, blessed ones! Enter the kingdom of God that He has prepared for you since the time the world was created.
Because I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
Naked and they covered me, sick and you visited me, in prison and you came to me.
At that time, those who did God's will will answer him and say: Oh Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? or thirsty and give you drink?
And when did we see you as a stranger and welcome you? Or naked and clothed you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to visit you?
And the king will respond to them and say: I tell you the truth: every time you do this to one of my brothers, no matter how small his situation is, you have done it to me!
And tell those on his left: Stay away from these cursed ones, the eternal fire prepared for Iblis and the angels with him.
Because I was hungry and you didn't feed me, and I was thirsty and you didn't give me water.
And I was a stranger and you did not host me, and naked and you did not clothe me, and sick and imprisoned and you did not come to me.
At that time, they will answer him and say: Oh Lord! When did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not help you?
And the king will respond to them and say: I tell you the truth: because you didn't do this for those whose matter is small, you haven't done it for me.
These will go to eternal punishment, and those who follow God's will will go to eternal life.
Chapter Twenty-Six for the Jews of Kitchaoro to kill Jesus
When Jesus finished all these words, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter will only be in two days, and a person's son will be handed over to people to be crucified.
At that time, the heads of religious men and tribal elders gathered in the house of Caiaphas, the high priest.
And they conferred among themselves to seize Jesus by trickery and kill him.
But they said: "Let's not do this during the holiday, so that chaos doesn't break out among the people." The woman who poured the perfume on Jesus
And when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Close to him, a woman has a jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head while he was sitting next to the food table.
And when his students saw what she did, they didn't like it and said: "Why this waste?"
Because this perfume could be sold at a high price, and its cost was shared among the poor.
And when Jesus knew what they were saying about her, he said to them: "Why are you condemning this woman? She has done nothing but good to me."
Because the poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
And all the sisters of this smell are on my back, they are her sisters to prepare me for the burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever people share this good news throughout the whole world, they will talk about what this woman did and remember her. Judas the traitor agrees to betray Jesus.
At your service, one of the careless students I called Judas Iscariot went to the religious leaders.
He said to them: "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" And they agreed with him on thirty pieces of silver.
And since that time, Judas has been looking for the opportunity to hand over Jesus. The Passover dinner with the disciples.
And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: "Where do you want us to prepare for you the Passover meal that you will eat?"
And he answered them and said: "Go to the city to so-and-so and tell him: When our master tells you: The hour has come, and I am going to pass by you for the holiday with my students."
And the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared the Passover meal.
And when it was close to dinner time, Jesus sat by the table to eat with the disciples the bread.
And they are having dinner, and someone says to them: "I tell you the truth: one of you will betray me."
And the students were very sad, and each of them started asking himself: "Am I, sir?"
And he answers them and says: "Whoever is with me, put your hand in the bowl; that is the one who will deliver me!"
The way of a human's son is to die as written in the Book of God, but woe to that man who will give up a human's son; it would have been better for him if he had not been born.
And he asks him, the Jew who had agreed to hand him over: "Am I, my Lord?" and Jesus replied to him and said: "You have said it." The Lord's Supper
And when they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks to God, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying: "Take and eat; this is my body."
And then he took the cup, thanked God, and gave them, saying: «Drink from it all of you,».
Because this is my blood, the blood of the covenant that will be shed for many people to forgive sins.
And I tell you: from today I will not drink this grape juice again until the day I drink it with you, new in the Kingdom of Ba.
And afterwards, they praised God and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus prophesies that Peter will deny him.
And Jesus told them: "Tonight, all of you will fall away, for it is written in God's book: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered."
But after I have followed death, I will precede you to the Majestic. Matthew
And Peter replied to him and said: "Even if they all accuse you, I never doubt you!"
And Jesus said to him: "I tell you the truth: tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
And Peter replied: "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" And this is what all the disciples told him. Jesus is praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Your time has come, Jesus and his disciples went to a garden called Gethsemane, and he told them: "Sit here while I go and pray."
And after that, Peter and the two sons of Zebedee were with him, and he began to feel sorrow and distress.
And he tells them: "My soul is very sad, even to the point of death, stay here and keep vigil with me!".
Then he stayed a little longer, bowed, and started praying, saying: "Oh father! Maybe after this ordeal, but not the way I want, but the way you want me to."
And then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: "Could you not stay awake with me for even one hour?"
Sahro and Wasliyo, be careful not to fall into the trap; the spirit is strong but the body is weak.
And he walks for the second time, prays, and says: "Oh father! If this ordeal cannot pass without me tasting it, then let it be your will."
He returned again and found them sleeping, because sleep had overcome them.
He left them and walked away again, prayed for the third time, and repeated the same words.
Then, he came to his students and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and resting? The hour has approached, and the son of man will be handed over into the hands of the sinners."
Let's go! That's the one who's going to pick me up. Jesus is holding on.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the disciples, arrived with a large group of armed men with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
And the one he handed him gave them a sign and said to them: "The man I am going to kiss is him, catch him!"
At that hour, I came to Jesus near Judea and said to him: "Peace be upon you, my Lord!" and kissed him.
And Jesus said to him: "Why have you come, my friend?". And they approached Jesus and seized him.
And he reached out his hand to one of those with Jesus, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him: "Put your sword back in its place! For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't call Dad now and send him more than twelve military units of angels?
But how will the words in the Book of Allah be realized, and how can it be that this should be the case?
At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds: "Why are you coming at me with swords and clubs as if I were a robber? Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't seize me!" Luke
But all of this happened to fulfill what was written in the books of the prophets. And at that moment, all the students forgave him and fled. Jesus in the Jewish court
But those who seized Jesus took Him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scholars of the law and the elders were gathered.
And Peter followed from a distance until he reached the house of the high priest, where he entered and sat with the servants to see what would happen in the end.
And the heads of the religious men and the high court officials were searching for some false testimony against Jesus to kill him.
But they didn't find anything, even though many false witnesses came forward. In the end, two witnesses testified.
And they say: "This man said: I can build the house of God and I will build it." John
And the head of the clergy stands up and asks Jesus: "Won't you answer even one thing about what these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent, and he said to the chief priests: "I charge you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
And Jesus answered: "You have said it! But I tell you again: from now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty God and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
At that moment, the head of the religious men intervened and said: "This is disbelief! We have nothing left to do with the witnesses, you have just heard his words of disbelief."
So, what do you think?». And they answered him: «He deserves to die!».
And they pushed him on his face and beat him, and some of them kicked him.
And they say: "Come on, prophesy for us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter denies Jesus
Peter was sitting outside, in the courtyard of the house, when a servant girl came to him and said: "Even I was with Jesus of Galilee!"
He denied in front of all those present and said: «I don't know what you're talking about!».
Then, he went to the entrance of the house and saw a servant girl who said to those who were there: "He was with Jesus of Nazareth too!".
And Peter denied again and swore, saying: "I do not know this man!".
And after a little while, those standing came up to Peter and said: "Certainly, you are one of them, because your accent gives you away!"
And he started cursing, swearing, and saying: "I don't know this man at all!". At that moment, the chicken shouted.
And Peter thought about the words Jesus told him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went outside and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
And early in the morning, the heads of the religious men and all the elders of the people conspired against Jesus to kill him.
And they handed him over and delivered him to the governor Pilate. Judas Iscariot hanged himself.
At that moment, when he saw Judah who betrayed him by judging Jesus, he regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the leaders of the priests and elders, the deeds.
He told them: "I repent because I didn't do anything wrong." They told him: "That's not our concern, take care of yourself."
And Judah threw the silver coin into the house of God, then went and hanged himself.
And the religious leaders said: "It's not permissible to put it in the House of God's fund, because it is the blood money of a person."
They agreed to buy a feddan of pottery and turn it into a garden for foreigners.
And because of that, people still call this farmland "Blood Farm" to this day.
At that time, what the Lord revealed to the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said: "And they took thirty pieces of silver, the price agreed upon by some of the people of Israel to be its price."
With this price, they bought the Fakhari estate as the Lord commanded me. Jesus before the governor Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor who asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" and Jesus answered him, "You have said it."
And whenever the religious leaders and elders accused him, he wouldn't respond to them at all.
And Pilate said to him: "Haven't you heard all this that they testify against you?"
And Jesus did not answer him a word, and because of this, the governor was very amazed.
It was customary for the ruler that every Easter he would release one of the prisoners that the people wanted.
And at that time, they had a famous prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
And when the crowd gathered, he asked them: "Which one do you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Because Pilate knew that it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
And when Pilate sat on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying: "Have you nothing to do with this righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of him."
But the heads of the religious men and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask Pilate to release Barabbas to them and to kill Jesus.
Pilate asked them: "Which of these two do you want me to release to you?" They answered: "Barabbas."
And Pilate said to them: "So what shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all answered: "Crucify him!"
He told them: "What kind of evil is this?", but they only increased their shouting and said to him: "Stubborn!".
When Pilate saw that he could do nothing further with them and that the crowd only grew more agitated, he took water and washed his hands in front of the people and said: "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
And the whole people respond to him and say: "Just leave his blood on us and on our children!".
At that hour, I release to them Barabbas, but Jesus I hand over to be crucified after they shout. The soldiers mock Jesus.
And the army of the ruler Jesus healed, brought him to the ruler's palace, and the entire military squad gathered around him.
And they tied him up and dressed him in a red cloak.
They placed a crown of thorns on his head, put a cane in his right hand, and began to kneel before him, laughing at him and saying: "Peace be upon you, O King of the Jews!"
They beat him and took the stick, hitting him on the head with it.
And after they laughed at him, they took off his cloak, dressed him in his clothes, and beat him to make him stiff. Jesus is being beaten.
And when they were leaving the city with him, they met a man from Kairouan named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross of Jesus.
And they reached the place I called Al-Jaljat, which means the location of the skull.
And they gave him to drink wine mixed with a herb called bitterweed, and when he tasted it, he didn't want to drink it.
They tied him up and divided his belongings among themselves after they beat him with the stick.
And the people kept saying that he was a spy.
And above his head, there was a sign written with his accusation: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
At that time, they tied him up with two guards, one on his right side and the other on his left.
And the people passing by were mocking him while they were walking around themselves.
And they say: "O you who will destroy the House of God and rebuild it in three days, come to yourself if you are a son of God, and descend from the cross!"
And the leaders of the religious men, scholars of the Sharia, and the sheikhs, even they laugh at him and say:
Other people were saved, but he couldn't save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
Yeah, rely on God! So free him now if he wants, because he said: I am the son of God!».
And even the Shafara who was crucified with him was mocked like the others. The death of Jesus.
Darkness fell over the entire country from noon until three in the evening.
And with the three o'clock hour in the evening, Jesus shouted loudly: "Eli, Eli, why have you forsaken me?" which means: "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"
And some of those who were standing nearby heard him and said: "He's calling Elijah."
One of them went and took a piece of the cloth, sprinkled it with vinegar, and placed it on the head of a young man, then handed it to him to drink.
And they tell him to others: "Leave him until we see if Elias will come to save him!".
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and died.
The four pillars of the House of God from top to bottom. The earth trembles and the rock splits.
And the graves become sweet, and many holy people are resurrected from death.
And they came out of the graves after Jesus rose from the dead, and entered Jerusalem, the holy city, and appeared to many people.
And when the military commander and the guards who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that happened, they were very frightened and said: "Truly, this man was the Son of God."
And there were many women who followed Jesus from Galilee and who mocked him, watching from a distance. Luke
Among them are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The tomb of Jesus
And in the evening, a man came from Ramla, named Yusuf, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
And this man entered and approached the governor Pilate, asking him to give him the data of Jesus. At that moment, Pilate ordered to give it to him.
And God, Yusuf, the Daat, and shrouded her in pure linen.
And he placed it in the new grave he had dug in the rock, then put a large stone over the door of the grave and walked away.
And Mary Magdalene and Mary, the other, were sitting opposite the tomb. They were sitting on the tomb.
And tomorrow, after the day that they prepare for Saturday, the heads of the religious men and the Pharisees gather at Pilate,
And they told him: "Remember, sir, that liar, when he was alive, used to say that after three days he would be sent."
Yeah, give your command so that the grave remains undisturbed until the third day, so that his students don't come at night to steal him and tell the people: "He has risen from the dead!" And this last lie will be worse than the first.
And Pilate said to them: "You have guards, go and set the guard on the tomb as you wish."
And they went to the grave chamber and performed the funeral prayer over it.
Chapter twenty-eight: Jesus rose from the dead
And when Saturday passed and dawn of Sunday arrived, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
Suddenly, a strong earthquake struck, as the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came, and shook the stone at the door of the tomb and sat on it.
And his appearance was shining like lightning, and his clothing was white like snow.
And the guards tremble with fear and fall like the dead.
But the angels told both women: "Don't be afraid! I know you're looking for Jesus who was crucified,"
Our way isn't here, because he was sent from death as he said. Come see the place where he was placed.
They hurriedly went and told his students that he had escaped death, and he would surpass you to Jebel, then you'll see him. Well, I have informed you.
And the women came out trembling from the grave, scared and very happy, and they went running to deliver the news to their children.
And Jesus met with them unexpectedly and said to them: "Peace be upon you!" And they came to him, holding his feet and worshiping him.
And Jesus told them: "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards reported what had happened.
And when the women were going, some of the graveyard guards went to the city and informed the religious leaders of everything that happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted on this matter, and they bribed the military with a lot of money.
And they told them: "Tell them that his students came at night, stole him while we were sleeping,"
Otherwise, the ruler will bring the news; we will convince him that nothing bad will happen to you.
And God, the watchman, the money, and they did as they were commanded, and he kept this news among the Jews until today. Jesus commissions his disciples.
As for the students of Haddash, they went to Galilee, to the mountain as Jesus instructed them, Matthew
And they did not see him prostrating to him, but some of them complained.
And Jesus came near to them and spoke with them, saying: "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
Come, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The Acts
And teach them to do everything I commanded you, and I am with you all the days, even until the end of time.
The first chapter: John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus
This is the Bedouin of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As written in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:
My voice echoes in the desert and I say: "I will send my messenger ahead of you who will show you the way."
And so John came to the desert, baptizing people and telling them about the baptism of repentance so that God would forgive their sins. Prepare the way of the Lord, and make His paths straight.
And they all went out to meet him, the people from the land of Judea and Jerusalem, and they baptized themselves at his hands across the Jordan, while they were confessing their sins.
John was wearing rough clothes made of camel hair, and he was girded with a leather belt, eating locusts and wild honey.
And he used to tell people and say: "Someone stronger than me will come after, and I don't deserve to bend down just to untie his shoelaces."
I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." John baptizes Jesus
He came to you, Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And at that hour when he came out of the water, he saw the sky clear and the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.
And you hear a voice from heaven saying: "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 Satan tests Jesus
And for your sake, the Spirit of God Jesus went out to the desert.
And forty days passed, and the devil was testing him. The monsters were circling around him, and the angels were mocking him. Jesus was preaching in Galilee.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus came to Galilee to proclaim the good news of God.
And he said: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near; repent and believe in the gospel." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
And whenever Jesus was walking along the Sea, which I called the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, because they were fishermen.
And Jesus says to them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
At that time, they left their window and followed him.
And he added a little more as he saw Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John in the boat fixing their nets.
And Jesus did not cry out to them, and they left behind Zubdi with the servants in the boat and followed him. Jesus heals a man possessed by a jinn.
And he went to Capernaum. On Saturday, Jesus went to the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them as if he had authority, not like the scholars of religion. When
And in the prayer room, one man who was possessed by a jinn started shouting.
And he says: "What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who I am: I am the Holy One of God!"
And Jesus rose up and said to the demon: "Be silent and come out of the man!"
The jinn threw the man to the ground and started to crawl, and the jinn shouted with effort and came out of him.
Everyone was amazed and started asking each other: "What is this? Is this a new teaching that he teaches with authority? Even the jinn obey him when he commands them!"
And the news about Jesus spread throughout Galilee. Jesus healed the mother of Peter and many people.
And Jesus went out with James and John from the prayer house, and they were walking to Simon and Andrew's house.
Nusaybah Samaan was lying in bed because she had a fever, and they were telling Jesus about her.
He approached her and took her by the hand, and she got up. She was annoyed by the heat and their guests.
I will come to you this evening when the sun sets; people brought all the sick and those possessed by demons to Jesus.
The people of the city were gathering near the door.
And Jesus healed many patients from many diseases, and many people were freed from madness, and He did not let the mad speak because He knew them. Jesus teaches.
And Jesus woke up early before dawn, went out, and went to a lonely place, and began to pray.
And Simon and those with him started looking for him,
And when they found him, they said to him: "Everyone is looking for you!".
And Jesus says to them: "Let's go to the nearby villages so I can proclaim the good news there, because I came for this."
And he went about preaching the good news in the houses of their prayers, and he heals all kinds of madness in the region of Galilee. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus heals a man with a withered hand.
Then one man came to Jesus, fell on his knees before Him, and begged Him, saying: "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
He was compassionate towards him, extended his hand, touched him, and said to him: "I want, so be pure!"
At that time, he moved away from the front and became pure again.
And Jesus warned him many times not to tell people, and he sent him away and said to him:
Be careful not to say anything to anyone! But go and show your deed to the religious man and give him your purification as instructed by Moses, so it will be a testimony for them.
But that man went out and started telling people everything that happened, Wadi, this news, until Jesus could no longer enter a city in front of the people, and he stayed outside in the empty places. And people come to him from all directions.
Chapter Two: Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and people heard that he was in the house.
A lot of people gathered, so there was no space left in front of the door. And he started teaching them the words of God.
And they brought him a man, paralyzed, carrying four strong men.
And when they couldn't approach him due to the crowd of people, they tore the ceiling above the place where he was lying down, made a hole in it, and lowered the bed in which the paralyzed man was sleeping.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man: "Son, your sins are forgiven you!"
And they would say, "Let's learn some knowledge of the Sharia," and they would say it for their own sake.
Why does this man speak like that, and say words of disbelief? Who can forgive sins except God alone?
And Jesus, filled with the Spirit, knew what they were thinking, and he said to them: "Why are you entertaining such thoughts in your hearts?"
As Sahl, he advises the paralyzed: "Your sins are forgiven," or he advises him: "Get up, lift your bed, and go."
But you should know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins. And he said to the paralytic:
Here's what I say: Get up, make your bed, and go home!
The man stopped, shook his bed, and went out in front of the people. They all wondered and praised God, saying: "We've never seen anything like this!" Jesus chooses when
And Jesus returned again to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and the crowd of people came to him, and he began to teach them.
And when he was passing by, he saw a man named Lawi, the son of Hafaa, in the tax house, and he said to him: "Follow me." So he followed him.
And when Jesus was eating in the house of Levi, Levi sat and ate with him and his disciples, along with many tax collectors and sinners, because many of them followed him.
When the scholars of the Law saw that he was eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And Jesus hears them and says to them: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The question about fasting
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked Jesus: "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?"
And Jesus answered them: "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the day will come when the groom will be chosen among them, and on that day they will fast.
No one patches old clothes with a piece of new fabric, because if they do, the new patch will shrink and the tear will grow larger.
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins, because if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. But new wine is put into new skins. Jesus teaches about the Sabbath.
And on Saturday # 2‏:23, which is the day of rest and worship for the Jews
The Pharisees came to him and said: "Look! Why do your disciples do things that are not lawful on the Sabbath?" Jesus passed through the fields of grain, and his disciples began to pick the heads of grain as they went.
Jesus replied to them: "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him?"
And how did he enter the House of God, in the days when he was the head of the clergy, and eat the bread they offered to God, which no one else was supposed to eat except the clergy alone, and he even shared it with the men who were with him?
He told them: "On Saturday, people are made, not people who are made on Saturday."
Because the son of man is the Lord even on Saturday.
The third chapter: Jesus heals on the Sabbath day
And Jesus entered the temple once again, and there was a man whose hand was paralyzed.
And the Pharisees remained watching Jesus to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they could find a charge against him.
And Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand: "Stand up and stand in the middle!"
And he said to the Pharisees: "What is lawful on the Sabbath day, to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to kill it?" And they remained silent.
He looked at them angrily, and he was very sad about the hardness of their hearts, and he said to the man: "Stretch out your hand!", and he stretched out his hand, and it became healthy.
At that time, the Pharisees came out and started consulting with the Herodians on how to kill him. Many people are following Jesus.
And Jesus went out with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed them.
And from Jerusalem and Edom, and from the other side of the Jordan Valley, and from inside Tyre and Sidon. All these people came to Jesus because they heard about what he was doing.
He told his students to prepare a boat for him so that people wouldn't crowd around him, Mark.
Because he healed many of them, even all the patients started crowding around him to be touched.
And those possessed by madness, when they saw Jesus, fell at His feet and cried out, and said: "You are the Son of God!".
But Jesus commanded and emphasized to them not to tell who He is. Jesus chooses the apostles, ignoring the rest.
He went up a mountain and cried out to the men he chose, and they came to him.
And he chose one messenger whom He called apostles, to be with him and send them to deliver the glad tidings.
And they have the authority to make madness come out.
And this neglect is: Simon, whom Jesus named Peter,
And Jacob, son of Zabdai, and his brother John, whom Jesus called Boanerges, which means sons of thunder.
Andreas and Philip and Bartholomew, and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot who will betray Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebul
Then Jesus went to a house, and the crowd of people gathered around him again so much that he and his disciples couldn't even eat.
And when the family of Jesus brought the news, they came to take him because they said: "He has lost his mind!"
The scholars of the law who came from Jerusalem said: "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and it is by the prince of demons that he casts out demons." Matthew
Jesus shouted at the scholars of the law and spoke with them in parables and said to them: "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Except for a kingdom divided and its people fighting among themselves, that kingdom will not be able to remain stable.
Otherwise, some family divisions will start and they will begin fighting among themselves; that family will not be able to stay stable.
