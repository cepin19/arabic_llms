If you don't want to, I do.
Oh Sultan, what are you saying?
Shame on you, a chance, a chance, our opportunity, don't waste it on us, it's a shame.
Then I'm not childish about this issue; I have the right to take, and you actually have the right to take before me.
Sultan, and may God have mercy on your parents, don't bring us problems.
Saleh, don't become like that, I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Honestly, is there a brother who advises his brother on everything I say?
You are hungry
In front of you, I found a tray with bread and meat.
The bowl has neither owner nor shepherd, nor does it have a limit.
Speak your truth
This Chinese dish is not placed in front of us again.
Don't become a fool, Saleh.
And let the opportunity slip away from us
No, no, don't try. Impossible, impossible. It's not me doing this.
The problem is that he's afraid
I am afraid of what?
This is a government project; everyone takes and siphons.
This is a rule
Now there are people who are not involved in the projects and are taking.
He is the chairman of the Akbeer project committee.
So why her, I mean, he has the thread and the needle.
Global Beaches Project for the Third Phase (Infrastructure - Phase One)
The bull charged at him.
This is the one with the extractor.
So he took it
And you, I will beat you.
You have the right to take from their project
Because his car was broken down
Who was the one who used to deliver the project site? It wasn't me.
No, if that's the case, it's your right.
Whoever gives you the right to petrol, your car is four times and five times.
Leave him alone
Don't become like monkeys and get a big head
Extend your hand and hit
Inside Thursday, your aunt's train
Now, as you say, they tell you you're a millionaire
One-third of the legitimate claim is valid
and one-third commission
Whoever hits the Popular Division
He says they're having a party for the country.
And buyers of a hundred springs
What did they do?
We lined up the row.
There's no use, Aunt.
May Allah guide him, God willing.
And he eats halva with him
Last night I was trying with him all night.
This is an opportunity
Because goodness will prevail
And goodness, God willing, will prevail.
This is well known
The matter should be between us.
Don't go outside
Then he advises after that
Just the guys
A problem that might cause a bone-like obstruction in the pharynx.
The rial started to decline
Sitting with him today
Two hours in the morning
And he started to believe.
We have a meeting with him later.
And we need to work on it properly, you and I.
The one who cuts off our livelihood
They only started the meeting with him, hoping to get his approval.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman
I don't know
Based on the fact that today is my first day of work.
Shame on you
No matter how it happens
Sure, but are you sure I'm taking it?
Now I am just asking you
You are hungry and not on the right path.
Do you eat or not?
I am the type of the chef.
It's none of your business
The Chinese return
We are still in the first item of the meeting.
If you need anything
And if you have a fear
I want to know that.
You and I are from the project
God, guide you, just Saif
Maybe because it's your first time participating as a committee head in a government project
And this is simple, my brother.
Our share is assigned to us
Within the project's budget
Oh, how, oh how
So that no one feels the situation
We put a bond on his soul for the amount.
This amount has been withdrawn
By the L L those in charge of the project
It doesn't work.
No no no, Saleh
You know the basics
But it seems there's a little fear inside you.
This is of course his right.
First and last
It means everything is in our hands
I did not kill the attractive one
I heal you, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is healing for you.
The new car of my friend, I trusted her.
He says so
The car is a Rofja, okay, good.
In a distinguished location
There is only one who has money.
I haven't told you yet, someone told me or I heard.
Whoever bought the land and registered it in his name
He told me, please.
Now he is holding the money in his hand
He's attracting now, huh
But we are here now
It means "enough" or "that's it."
We are not the ones to blame
He takes us out through the eastern door
He wants to go and eat a bite.
Don't shake your head
And otherwise, your brother
Come and sit down, there's nothing but good intentions. Come on.
I stayed awake all night thinking about him.
Kill him no matter what, even if he dies, he deserves it.
Layn made him agree
And this is supposed to be
And God willing, you won't take it just once.
This project: The Third Global Beaches
(الـبُنية التحتية)
Then they start the second phase.
And you continue with him
May Allah reward you well, you did not fall short.
It's nice what you left, but only if he agrees.
And you are just like everyone else
But there's nothing wrong with it
But God willing, I convinced him.
We want to praise him.
They all agree on the matter.
Until he told me afterwards that he agreed
It seems that Pibon is their quarter to attend the project budget planning meeting.
It's permissible for them, and they must follow him.
They're putting it, sure about it.
I will submit it as quickly as possible so that it can be approved.
Make yourselves comfortable
Brother, who is this? Do you know him?
This is happening, brother-in-law, will you contribute with me?
This means
You have the doors, windows, and everything related to finishes.
Sweet, sweet
Enough for you all so I can finish.
You really defined your rights.
We take something
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And we determine the amount we take
We have people waiting and wanting.
Abdulaziz's words are correct
Hey, someone who determines his own right, half a million.
This week, he will settle himself.
And he specifies the amount he wants.
They decided, thought, and determined.
What do you want from you?
Do as you please
Don't worry, don't worry about them.
What is your companion? What are you and what is he?
What is this that Allah has brought us into?
What are you doing here? Are you involved in this project?
This is a government project.
Your brother's name is Sultan.
This is my neighbor's house.
It takes us until the car breaks down.
Register me with you
Sund Abdullah
Lala, there are three others besides him.
What should I do about it? I miss him.
Just tell him, O Amoud, let me finalize our budget.
No, no, this is a fixed amount.
How much should I put for him?
And on him, poor man, he has children.
He has Zaidis, leave it at twenty-five, a quarter of a hundred.
and a quarter of a hundred
He returned, all stuck together, stuck.
How much will you distribute to these?
He returned a lot
The kind mother when mentioned
Yes, Mom
Oh no, no, no, this is the last one, Dad.
No, Dad, you want to go to Thailand for treatment.
Moment by moment, Ashfej
Why are you acting so stubborn about it?
Remaining only from the first stage (the infrastructure)
Used vagina
Add three thousand to them
Buy me watches from Thailand where the entire dial shines like this.
I recorded it.
Oh my Imamate
No, Mom, I didn't register it. I just wanted to confirm the name with you.
My darling, I tell you, mother.
The plate is too big
Oh, come on, the budget needs to be set; it can't just be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow, we will meet, and everyone will say the amount they have in mind.
No problem for you
Million Enough
My dear, I love you.
Guys, guys, just a moment. Sorry for the disturbance. Give us a chance.
The committee is currently meeting to approve the project budget; the project is now closed, and the money issue is settled.
I stay increased
We told you to stay quiet about the scandal; they are sitting in the ministry yard.
Ooo Ansarakh, don't expose us
Hey, until now, I was wondering what you all are doing gathered here.
We turned off the electricity; it's out and there's a problem.
Then you make a fuss for us in the Ministry Square.
Come on, come on, come on
Cut, did you hear?
Dude, you were with them when I reached the budget.
Without my brother
With the project, we all mean all of us, fifty million.
This is just the first phase, only fifty million.
The amount has arrived
Hi Saleh
Oh Riyal, the owner of the Nasseefah, Salim
Anyway, take care.
Come on, calm yourselves down and let’s work. All the beneficiaries are waiting for us, so please.
It's not a problem, but the most important thing is that we don't want discussions based solely on the budget and nothing else.
And tomorrow we will start implementing the project
It serves a very large segment of the community.
May God protect you, this is the Global Beaches Project for the third phase.
This is, God willing, the first stage.
(الـبُنية التحتية)
This project is for the upcoming generations
Of course, in the name of the program's family, I love to congratulate you and also congratulate you on the opening of the project, which I believe will be tomorrow, God willing.
And the work took a full year and a half.
A year and a half
Once again, of course, under the name of the Future Tenders program
This project
And for future generations
And may Allah continue His blessings of oil upon us.
Second, third, and tenth stages
Presence of a delegate
Welcome and greetings
They are more deserving of us here; when will the cars come to take us?
We Ween Ayodona Ashfij
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds. You have grown and become senile.
We all sat down, exhausted from the heat.
Oh, girl of the people
But I don't see anything
Majoo is only the sea in front of me
Why did they take you away?
Eman told me that your sister Munira is well.
About the story of my father's land that is in the desert
I said, "Be fair, go see who told her and gave her false news."
What is this land?
But when someone sees a farm in the desert, they say this is my father's.
Then I get bored with these stories
You have brothers
They work hard, mashallah, invest in land, and labor in real estate and companies.
I am the head of the family
Oh, Eman
And then, my sister
What do you mean, you don't know?
They give it to me against their will.
These are your brothers
And there's nothing sweeter than honesty
Because of the money
We became the ones who believe in her to take her to the hospital.
She has been in court with her brothers for about a year now.
Nineteen years old, if not more
No more
Brothers, Umm Salim is a thief
He came back and told me yesterday.
Dad, just build me a mosque before I die.
You don't know
I'm not saying that your brothers are like that, God forbid.
Now my father has been dead for a whole year.
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the estate
What else do you want?
Not every three months he goes to her, Jake.
Saqr, calm down, let us find out what the matter is.
It depends on how.
We changed, I swear, sisters who don't see Ariel.
The solution is with me
Where are you from?
And I have no money.
Munira Shajouf
And the one who surrenders you inside him
It became fifty thousand
Because I dared and asked about my father's land that is in the desert.
I am sure that my right is more than this.
Everyone lives in that desert plain.
and their children in the best schools
Shaghoulaj, O Munira
I'm not staying silent about my rights.
That's it, I'll take my share.
We invest our money in the company better because I don't want to.
Every second head
Mercy died in people's hearts
Don't say that your brothers are better than my brothers.
Inside me
Twelve years
And I am practicing in these courts
And in the end
Neither right nor wrong.
So, why do they do this?
That's why I tell you, oh mother, let them do it.
Take them gently
And Bilithong Telta
Alright, so why do courts take all these years?
We are all four hundred thousand.
If we reach millions like the other countries
By God, Mom, I didn't think a verdict would be issued.
My dear, you are my siblings
I swear, Mom, I don't want anything.
Oh Mom, what should I say
I do not say "Qir," we rely on God, and He is the best disposer of affairs against the oppressor.
Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.
You had an appointment at the court a week ago.
Are you serious, Mom?
I say the judge, write a memo.
And this is us, oh mother, from one note to another.
Come on, Mom, they are investing millions and you're just watching.
And with your right hand, as I told you, adapt and improve.
I do not take his right
That's why I say if I were you
Be quiet about what they give me.
Because of the time
Your father is halal with us
Men are asking you
She has it, I mean.
A few inquiries about her share and that.
Just want to get to know you and then you're done.
If I don't guide him
Ben Fek and Badlik Iah
I am going to leave now
Are you expecting us to give up?
Two hundred fifty, and her husband works hard for her.
It turns out, hit your head during the flood.
What made her start talking now
But greed
And there is no paradise, my share.
My father inherited and he determines for me whether to show or not, or how?
Neither I nor he is determined.
This is the command of God
Why do they torment my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to act like this.
This money is useless.
She has been working for about thirty to forty years.
I don't know how to deal with this, Nasser.
Lands, buildings, and real estate are easy to recognize.
How much do they earn?
Even the company
You have the right to go and learn everything.
And I am not worried.
How do you go back to them?
It's up to you.
And it's not up to you; I have the right to see everything.
Agency without a gate
Sister, I have given him a power of attorney.
This official power of attorney allows him to access everything we have in the company.
Saqr Saad
Come, long sword
Saqr Khalas
Brother Nasser
Excuse me, I am taking.
At your service, Your Majesty
And by God, you are in front of me
Excuse me, please, let's go.
Don't let him catch us doing anything.
Sure, now I will complain.
And he said that you are a force.
It means leaving it to his discretion.
He has an official document in his hand
Officially, we can't prevent it.
He has the right to know everything about everything.
If the budget and accounts are dry
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If the budget is dry, then scrutinize and be precise
Hit twelve at eight
Zain divided it into three parts.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much it costs?
This is what we are demanding from her.
This is only if he knows about the lands and projects
And we're fine.
We are not afraid of anything.
He wants, hello and welcome, he doesn't want this one available.
He goes to deal with it himself and with her.
They give their sisters small amounts of money to live on.
Once married
Her husband supports her.
What do I care about the money?
Oh yeah, this is the right talk.
At your command
Let him be at ease
Even my office
My brother Rashed, I mean, it was supposed to be from the beginning.
At your service
File file
When I knew her true inheritance
Apart from the villas and the lands you don't know about
Seven of them came out
Look at the sixteen lands
Weak in her blindness
The poor girl was shocked.
By God, it's a shame
Stay behind them
Please, for the love of my parents, Dad, don't bring me to court.
The worst thing a human has.
The coldest thing is at the angered person
One minute text
And then he says his usual word
Seven thousand four hundred and I don't know how many
Do you see Eid with them, Dad?
You shouldn't move out of the room at all, Mom.
God willing, I will see you.
No, the house is your house. What are you talking about?
Our photographer and my sister are shining.
After we caught him at the door and expelled him from the company
I remember someone from when I was in school and he hit me.
One named Abdullah
Oh, عاد
I don't understand
It means he can influence them
God willing, he can.
EEE
They do not resort to courts
You see courts like there's nothing behind them but memos.
And delays and a slaughter of lawyers on my back
The years pass
And life passes by
And you don't take even a single riyal from them
May God have mercy on her, Umm Salmeen
She advised me one day before she died.
She told me to endure, you go to the courts.
Tell me, are these our courts?
She passed away, and she didn't take a penny from her inheritance.
She died, and her case is still with the judge.
What if we were like other countries
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Two years ago
This is my brother Saad
May God keep you all safe.
The most important thing
Unity and brotherhood
Brother Rashid
You are like my brother
Don't let problems and money and
You have another topic besides your sister's topic to talk about.
You, please
Why are you silent?
He is right
They consider my father's lawful earnings as a burden on me.
Yesterday, my mother told me that she is the wife of your brother Saad.
And her father is a correspondent at the ministry
All of it is from my father's lawful earnings.
We've endured all of this.
Go ahead with this last attempt
Tell your friend Abdullah.
They disrespected him, so they scolded his manners and expelled him.
Go and meet Al-Mutawa Abdulrahman Ashbeisoui with them
Really tasty
He told me, God willing, Nasser.
Ain Khair
Threaten them with the court
You forgot the late Umm Salim and her pilgrimage from the courts.
Brothers, Umm Salim and the others, they have the court normally.
Just my brothers
They might be afraid of people's opinions.
They might say it's shameful to go to court; what will people say about us?
Let's go see the soul of Mutawa Abdulrahman, what is he doing?
May Allah bless you and keep you safe
Friday sermon, it is
Don't close the door.
What do you say, my son?
He says the truth
Go outside, please. Come on, get up.
I am going to court tomorrow morning.
Why delay until tomorrow?
Then I am the one who decides, not you.
What does "Ashbiser" mean from now until after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid
Take it as a word from me
I killed you before.
Let me threaten them with the court
Now he's begging me to delay my trip.
Because they are dry, my love.
It's necessary to go to your sister's place, Munawar.
What is this?
Ha, you told me, what is this? May God bless you.
The viewers are safe.
A very small sculpture of the courthouse building
May Allah bless you
The viewers are safe.
Your anger is accepted
Nothing but you said
I will kill you if you don't go today
Leave it for tomorrow.
For God's sake, I will prepare this office for the courthouse building.
Ready, we're tired of it, be careful on the road.
They are coming through this door.
As soon as I enter through the door
You put all your things.
A phone made of some metal so it doesn't do anything. Beep beep beep beep beep beep
You are registering the case. It says to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight. The elevator is to be taken.
Destroyed in the offices
My judge, if you need, for example, a specific judge.
And this one too
You want to complain about us
Come, I will show you the way
And when will you take your right?
You take the sixty thousand.
As he said
Goodbye
Today we returned home to my sister's house.
Oh, the ministry approved his project for Abu Walid.
My sister, tell me, I’m flying with happiness, I can't believe it.
He told me to approve my project because I have it.
Thank God, finally my turn, haha, just once.
Oh God, your happiness now, Abu Walid
I am capable of it
My sister, tell me, yesterday I couldn't sleep from happiness.
SubhanAllah again, Manal
Oh, boy, I don't get involved in these matters, but God has blessed him with decent children.
God willing, tell my father the truth.
Forgive us, we're back to the palaces
We apologize, Bo Walid
God bless you, Abu Walid. You didn't fall short.
May God enrich you and increase your goodness, God willing.
Good cook, I swear, O Waleed.
Now, get yourself a good accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me, "Just pay the office rent, and the rest is on us."
Please go ahead, uncle
And my love, look into my eyes
My father BlackBerry
We want to build a big house
Look at him responding to him
Dad, we agreed today that you will call me after eating.
And now, dear audience, with a word from the project owner, my father, Abu Waleed. Please, go ahead, thank you.
Sorry, we're back
Congratulations, congratulations, Abu Walid
You deserve it, you deserve it, God bless you, you deserve it
Honestly, you have nothing to do with business and commerce.
Oh Riyal, this project has a story, guys.
How are you?
See how it means, thank God
That year
Oh, the Japanese team is playing against us.
I am in Souq Waqif
I don't care about him
This is a catalog of the Mal Factory, multiple halls, the ministry. We have students applying for them.
Oh crazy one, I am building for you
What he understands
Any contractor
Japanese tails are not a game
It just stops, but I tell you, the computer.
I want cinema
I wanted a kitchen, a kitchen that hits a kitchen
I tell you the day I submitted the department committee catalog.
Nice, so how is your agreement with the factory?
I paid them an amount
Introduction means
The most important thing is to agree with the factory
I signed it, thank God.
And they gave me an extension, so I can place the first order later.
That's enough, stop it.
Trust it, it's correct
Just waiting for Bo Fahd's signature.
Here, your secretary is bothering you
Qali Bu Fahad didn't come to work
I'll order you a juice.
Hey Abu Walid, you did well.
The problem with Abu Fahad is that he might come, or he might not come.
Day exists
He has no time
So, come on, now.
You are the manager here.
Tebi Bu Fahad, he's killing me
It is not necessary for him to be the one to make it happen.
Inside all these files, my desk is cluttered, and I need Bu Fahad's signature.
And the solution means
God help you
It's a quarter past two, Abu Walid.
The shift is over
I don't think Bofhed will come.
God help you, come tomorrow
You say that you have known the manager for a long time and your friend.
Shafij, you
My crazy director is sitting at the desk taking pictures, but he's on the computer.
They are sitting at their desks, explaining the time.
It's just the starch in their dishdashas that causes the damage.
I swear I left the office saying I was going for a break, and I actually went for a break.
It means they don't do anything, Moliya.
They don't move a chair unless I command Abu Fahd.
Yesterday, the manager didn't ask about you.
And the interests of God's creation are neglected
So you look like you're going to see them later.
By God, it's a mess.
Every day I face a problem
Because the factory gave me a deadline
No, God willing, no, God, no, I say it.
Alright, and if he asks about you
It's not just you waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files
They are all waiting for Bo Fahd's signature
I am expecting today to come.
Relax, you all.
Go ahead and walk away
I will talk to you later.
If anything happens, I'll call you, but don't call and scare the guys, poor things.
Goodbye, take care
Forgiveness, you scared the lady.
Hey boy, we've agreed on my appointment for a month.
Just let the man sign, man. What is this talk?
Dad, the registration appointment is going to be missed for my daughter at the university, the scholarship papers are still pending until I finish, Dad.
And my problem is with the factory, the delay, the delay.
You all wait a little.
All your transactions are being signed.
The Riyal drinks his coffee, but as soon as he's done, he leaves without saying a word.
That's it, they told you to be quiet, that's it.
Hello, Your Excellency
Goodbye
Moment by moment, guys
Wait a moment, where are we going? Hold on a little.
Understand what happened
What happened after?
He looked at his important trip.
He has a private door
This is the case again
Brother, our interests have stopped, brother.
Every day, press Enter, Enter, move forward
Let's see, wait for Abu Fahd
Your messenger, sir
The one who blames Allah is the one who blames Him
Where does he find her from, or whose mother?
The factory in Japan
Amtrashin, the deadline has ended.
And your aunt is on the other side.
She is a poor woman who borrowed money.
Where does he find her from, or where?
Mom, I am very worried about my father.
I won't let him go.
Who am I talking to
Hello from
Bo Walid
So you tell me the factory and your ex-wife's money
Wait, Fo Fahd!
So, Dad, how long should I wait?
They find nothing on their tongues except
This is us waiting for Bofhed.
Oh, Dad, you're not neglecting me.
But all my friends will be attending university next week.
Shadour Yabeh
The phone is with you.
As long as your mind is at ease, my patience is only for you.
Alright, who will speak?
Hey, wait for Bofahad
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
You were very patient with us.
God is great
Bo Walid's condition is not serious.
My fishing boat, my sister, is trembling, shivering, and trembling.
Because the deadline is approaching.
Five days remaining
He spends all his money on it.
God is sufficient for me against him
Oh, better, I swear, I swear, I swear
God willing, I feel better.
This is a strange thing.
The above text is nonsense.
The second text under the moving mall
My complaint made me fifty percent better
Make me a discount
I do not hesitate
God willing, everything will turn out fine with your affairs.
And my sister did not fall short
She said she's waiting for her money a little.
May Allah reward her with goodness.
I made fun of your sister, but
Our manager appeared to me, may God help us with our manager.
It seems our director heard.
God knows what this director is really planning.
I meet her from him or from Boufahad
God help me, I swear it's a problem.
And with the last day of the morning
My halal is being wasted
May God not make us angry
Towards the target, towards the target
Where can you be so bold as to speak?
You bring me a hook from the connected one.
Brother Abu Walid
I'm calling you because you broke my heart.
Just stay standard, bye, on the phone.
Goodbye
You have always been a committed person.
We used to set you as an example.
Don't think that I am unaware of your outings every day from work.
I can deduct from you
And then with this mobile.
Instead of deducting from you
I put you on the inventory committee.
Are you going with them today for the inventory?
Wayani, don't go beyond the work hours.
And when you rise
I don't blame myself afterward
Poor guy, today is his last deadline.
He is lying down, his mother is calling him, waiting for them to contact him.
I'm afraid he'll get fired from his job.
Oh, Abu Walid, my phone that rang
He disappoints.
Let the poor guy go.
Oh, Abu Walid
Oh, human of the world
What's wrong with you, Abu Walid? I don't call you on the phone.
Go finish your business.
And I don't worry
You are not falling short, I swear.
It seems that Dawm Bofahd
I made a mistake for you.
This is a senior official
Where is he going
Yallah Oz Pakistan
My brother, go to Öz Pakistan.
Oz Pakistan, third office on the right
I do not cough
Wait for Abu Fahd
Don't sit down
Don't look at me
Or do you want?
House by house
Forward
Guys, the Riyal is down.
I wonder how long it has been for me now
And all these years, it's you.
My hopes are papers, and my sorrows are papers
Ride, she fell
Wrap and walk among these ministries
But we were young
This is what I see in front of you: I put a bread bag on my stomach like this because I am carrying a plaster cast for the kids.
And then God bless you, may God keep you safe. I learned how to ride the motorcycle.
Especially after the school I learned from and bought.
My car is oil-colored
They flirt with me when I ride the bike, oh wow.
A livelihood and raising children
The director has arrived
When I finish, God willing, we will have the sweetness.
Praise be to Allah, praise be to Allah
Alright, you're quitting the job.
I testify that, O Abu Saeed, you did not fall short.
Now I want peace, brother. Woe to me. Goodbye.
We are present.
I don't want to extend your stay for another year.
Enough, enough
May Allah reward you with goodness
You extended four years to me.
Well, I was supposed to be retired a long time ago.
All the kids are busy.
The last one yesterday, I was on duty.
Now he's back, Abu Abdulaziz.
I'm looking for comfort.
No, and your job is a reporter
On Khanfroush, good, come on
Come on, donate already
I've been four years, maybe five, since I last tasted the khanfurosh.
What a sweet thing about him
I smell it in my nose
Everything you command will happen, God willing.
Request the Human Resources department for me
You finished the papers
Since yesterday
Your transaction is delayed like this.
Man, I am bored.
That's it.
Don't cut us off again
Hello, Dad Khalid
From this moment on, it's over.
God willing, we will rest, Dad. We will rest, oh wow, yes.
Sweet, sweet
I'm at work and can't leave.
You can pass the General Administration of Human Resources.
I have a transaction there.
I want you to take it and deliver it to the Civil Service.
Tess, thank you, thank you, sir, I won't fall short.
Where are you going
My sister, it's raining; I'm going to the bank.
And our resolve is all of us
What now
The bank is waiting for me
Pickle it with someone
Sorry, I can't leave work.
Okay, okay, let's go. Goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
I say he can't go out
What are you doing now?
Early in the morning, I was passing by the bank.
A learner all these years, I keep going.
He definitely feels the heat.
This is better for him.
You just let him rest already.
Poor Farhan is happy to go back home
He called me and told me that Khaled
A tip so he can finish his transaction.
Fear God
Everyone depends on themselves
My mother feels sorry for the cockroach.
Oh mother, nothing will happen to you.
I'm not sorry about the cockroach, Mom.
But I say, whoever leaves work and goes to her.
Khaled will go and what will he do?
Lying in his room
Those who got lost in their sea
Good morning, Dad
Hello, my daughter
Dad, and whoever greets you.
They just called me and said the manager is very angry.
And bring me that transaction.
Hello, Umm Saeed
He told you to let the kids rely on themselves. Why don't you listen to the words?
You are the one who doesn't understand.
He and on him Ali
Here I am waiting for you, and the little bird is in front of me.
Today we will eat it
Goodbye, Godspeed
My dear, I forgot to tell you.
My dear, my beloved, father
God help you
Yes, the one who goes to the market
Get out of here quickly.
You have come out, my daughter, you have come out
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
MashaAllah عليك
Zain, I cleaned the house.
Eels eel ice
He told you to stay at home.
Tell your children how they manage their own lives.
Shasawi, O Saeed
Their circumstances are difficult; I have to help them.
Enough, enough, relax
And I will bring you a glass of water
And I will bring you the breadroll so you can eat it
Poor Daikh
And from the taxi drivers
And on him, on his face
The branch in the market has closed.
They want the national ID card
After you get in your car
And I went to the papers
My son, praise be to God
Everyone depends on himself
I killed you
I want you to rest.
Hello, Ailes Yana
Good luck, don't miss out
Adabaj from the Ministry to the Ministry and behind government transactions
Adabaj from Wazahat to Wizarah
Behind the kids' dealings
I respect their elders and care for their young; truly, you spoil them.
The kids are holding good important jobs.
And their time is crowded, what can we do?
Every day except for meetings with the director, or with the responsible person, or with the minister.
They have nice jobs, but it takes time to find them work, oh my.
And you wander around, finishing your transactions and your manners, and another job makes you a mercenary, sitting there, how else?
Come on now, may Allah reward you.
Now, come back safely.
Come on, forgive us already, oh Boushaheen
They finally contacted me and told me I was done.
If you send your father tomorrow, he will finish the transaction for you.
That's why I'm going to be very late.
Fear your Lord
Tomorrow is impossible, especially tomorrow I can't.
In his love for you
He is annoyed and tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair on his head.
There is someone lying in the room for two days.
From this wind in the streets and from these suns
Khal, may you be given the treatment
And go run, finish it for him.
A committee coming from the morning until the next day
My reputation, Mom
It means my building is beautiful.
Madam Bajer, today is your last day and the committee.
Your transaction must be completed tomorrow.
Come at night and complain to me about them.
Bajer has a mandatory committee; he must meet with them.
What's up, Dad?
His tears in his eyes
Actually, I didn't cut off my father.
The committee is the one that changed their minds.
And they said, "Come at the end of the week."
Alright, tell your dad.
Oh Dad, don't go
I am going to heaven and I will come.
I'm not just hanging out in this cafeteria with these trashy people.
Laughs at him
Alright then, that's it.
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm going to him.
Thank you, Dad.
Eternal, oh father
Thank him, he's mistaken
And I turned out to be selfish afterward
And what tires you is the day the committee does not come.
You are the good and the blessing
From today onwards
We handle our transactions ourselves
Teles at home
And this is your head, I kiss it
Hello, hello, hello, oh Bok
Good morning to you.
Oh, dearest father
In the whole world
Don't be upset, mother.
And I don't get upset
And you, just like I told you.
When will I finish this transaction?
I want to finish it myself.
And they told me, come on, hurry up
You have a meeting
With His Excellency the Minister
The happiest moment was your father.
I have a stubbornness with these elders
Oh my joy, they said your son is with Al-Wa and Wailah, this is him.
Trust in God, go to your work, Mermoureh
Bousaid, where are you?
And the one who surrenders you, my father
The envelope in front of me, brother
You just pass by, and I will send you the envelope with the mattress.
My dear, Dad
It means he didn't fall.
It seems he forgot
Because the committee is meeting after an hour.
There is no god, may Allah keep you safe
My son has a meeting with the minister today, oh no.
Just give me the deal.
This is my situation, from work to the house and from the house to work.
No one is around anywhere.
Peace be upon you
And upon you, sir. Please, go ahead. Please, go ahead.
Oh no, no, I didn't tell him, I didn't tell him or anything.
Which of my friends is going to the beach this week?
And he tells you, my mother is there in the village.
He will go in the morning
He is taking his time there, of course.
No, to add more to the poetry of the story.
I tell you, a cook who doesn't need anything.
And I go to him
Goodbye
Hopefully, everything is fine.
Hope everything is fine, Uncle
God guides you, that's all.
No, your father, I have nothing, I have nothing.
Your papers have scattered
That one is at the farm
And this is from the excess.
Friendship deal
Thirsty, father, I want water
Yip li mai mai
My dear children
No, no, just erase it, erase it, I don't want it.
Don't write like this
Let them get confused
Fij, my sister
And you are the real one
No, no, I killed him.
Yes, indeed, my brother.
Allow me, my sister.
The one they call the league and the cup
And Tam talked about the judgment.
My mother says, this boy Sheikhoura will have children.
Hold on to it, but it's all nonsense and just nonsense.
People have started to get used to it again.
They tell Waibon to speak, and they tell him to talk on the radio and television.
And more than that
Take him, catch him, my sister, and cut him in prison
My friends, my sisters
Hey girl, these days no one is useful to anyone.
Having problems
By God, right now, if I die
I won't let him talk, and as he says, he's just talking nonsense.
Thank God for his safety
Blessings visited us
Goodbye
Being late to work like this, Mom.
Listen, Dad
I was awake all night yesterday.
And I warn you
Just now, I just wanted to remind you, Dad.
That's enough, Mom
Impossible after I call
No radio, no television, even Qtel is not connected.
Your sister is living in a shelter; she has been there for two days.
And Munira, your fiancée, her tears fall four by four along her ravine.
For God's sake, Dad, have mercy on us, and whoever shows mercy to your parents.
Like you said
Stop with the nonsense
I won't bother you anymore.
Your uncle Bu Omayra
Yana after they put you in prison
And Khallas said
Expose the secret
Come on, Dad, his gift fell with him when he asked for protection from Iblis, and God willing, only good will happen.
The second time he grabs your hand and takes you to court, he releases his daughter.
That's enough, Mom
Repentance after I say
If you call the radio and TV, you only blame yourself.
Kill for repentance
Let me go now.
Just between you and me, only this talk
The manager told me
What we need is with us
This will go tomorrow and mess up the management.
He just makes nonsense for us.
Alright, so what is the manager saying now?
Wow, he has a million excuses and excuses to say.
So, where should I go?
But that's it, I'm done.
I miss you
Yes, sir
Goodbye
I killed you
You know, Saleh, I told you.
The public interest has forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, but
And the one who only gives you nonsense.
That's sweet of you
Stop with the nonsense
Yes, indeed
I'm still here for you
We have work, please.
What is this trouble, Dad?
Lynn, organize the affairs
I miss you so much, I am longing for you.
I did not kill Bivenshuna
Muneera was standing and listening when I told you.
Oh, Dad, I said
I hear them ignoring me, I just came from the hospital.
My soul, you're inside now
And let me talk to Dad.
We said it was a mistake and kept silent.
We stay silent now after we finish him.
Just because we are family
You know how
Seek refuge from Satan
God willing, only good things will happen.
Remember God, God will guide you
I don't want to have coffee, leave your coffee for yourself.
I know you.
bored
Your uncle is giving you a two-week grace period.
By God, no one will hold you back from your hand, and the court will take you so I can divorce.
Mom, even if I leave
You're always in trouble.
Just bear with yourself
Even if someone tells you
Just ignore what you hear
Isn't this just nonsense?
Yeah, man, it's him.
But don't punish me these days
Just tell him, enough with the nonsense, man. We only want to hear it from you once, just once.
It's okay, that's it.
To be the police.
No, Mom, you are misunderstanding.
And my cousin has a problem, so we asked him to speak tomorrow on the radio.
He was a little hesitant.
We felt that we spoke to him in a public place, so he hesitated.
I said, "The truth is, my cousin's son, K, I will give him the house and talk to him privately; that's better."
So you felt that he wanted to say something
It means hesitant and this and that.
They came from somewhere.
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
I am not your mother, nor do I know you, and I disown you until the Day of Judgment. Did you hear me or not?
Saleh Saad
No, God bless you. This is finally over. Ugh, we're rid of it. Thank God.
You have a sense of responsibility
An example of a successful employee
But unfortunately
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
Why did you bother yourself and come?
I just finished cooking. I was about to talk to the secretary to inform you that I am coming.
Shahin, how are you?
You didn't know from this.
Is there anyone in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh but is talking nonsense?
You are righteous, but your nonsense is ruining everything.
Stop with the nonsense
Hello, the job
But there are no jobs, I mean, I understand the circumstances.
Nice, man. Did you hire him?
Who am I to employ him with us
I haven't left any place, I swear, O Manira, I haven't gone anywhere.
Not a single person told me five minutes before I arrived that there was a job, but they took it, I mean, it's gone.
My sister, who lived yesterday, was divorced by her husband.
It means my responsibility has become this big.
After one, his responsibility became this big
I swear I don't know what to do, I swear.
He is sitting close to the minister.
But honestly, I think it's not fair.
He thinks that I am afraid to put him in my place
That's enough, you've killed me.
Who told you I will be silent
I just want this way to be away from me
I'm thinking of a way to kill him.
Finish it all at once
But what is it?
I know him
It's not someone who talks on the radio.
Bieba lak al-milas
And you just a bite of information
You, Saleh, are a citizen full of national spirit.
You are a patriotic citizen
Thank you
I swear, I'm done.
I consider your voice as the voice of truth
I, O Abu Fahd, after I talked with him a little.
The most truthful one, O Saleh
I haven't heard this in a long time, the one who says it's just nonsense.
I want to get to know him
This is normal, Saleh.
I am a fighter in the tent
Forward, forward, forward
And few are like you
Your words are very sweet.
And your voice on the radio is much sweeter.
We only heard nonsense, nonsense.
Ambla, just one more for Bofad. Now he's going to say it, he's going to say it. Heard it, heard it, heard it, heard it.
Just nonsense
This is the original, Your Majesty. This is it.
I ask you to continue, don't stop
A little difficult
Then stop, it's on me
Because I want it to continue for the sake of people's problems and their issues.
Listen, O Saleh
I am giving you only one problem.
You, O Saleh, are the voice of truth
Get up, I want you to get up a little.
This is a senior official.
He asked me, brother, tell him I said it, I swear.
Yes, indeed.
This is your chance
And the opportunity does not come twice.
No, I mean no
What's wrong with you? You don't understand.
Please be patient, I beg you, my brother.
Problems, troubles, and chaos
Oh, Your Excellency the Minister
The ministry in its latest project ordered eight thousand tubes.
It can withstand a pressure of twenty-two centimeters.
But this employee
He agreed on a pipe capacity
So he can benefit from the price difference
Just nonsense
You haven't fallen short, you haven't fallen short, oh brother Saleh, but it's nonsense.
There is no god but Allah, peace be upon you
This call is a private request
God willing, you will call it a blessing.
Just nonsense, just nonsense
Do you know
The situation and what to do
But this is the last one and only.
The Sultan flew honestly
In a hurry, the minister is leaving.
I tell you, he said something true
Hey, now the arena is empty for Abu Fahd to play alone.
I do all the tasks.
Oh, Your Highness
At your service, Minister.
Goodbye
Enough with the nonsense
Alright, this is the last one, no more after this.
Oh, and these are my job papers, the forgiving one, just fooling around.
It means what they wanted me to achieve.
Listen to my words
Because he is afraid
He defends him and exposes his scandals and calamities
You point out the flaws and criticize.
They are afraid of you
You deceived me, sister Asha.
You are the kind one.
Bajer Bee, your uncle Abu Amnira
The condition is to work
They don't have any issue other than criticizing and pointing out flaws.
Why do they hate our country
Do we have flaws?
We don't have connections.
This is the first time I hear the word "wasata".
In our government circles, you go around in circles.
We don't have a bribe
And I do not know her
And look at the employee
Do foreigners take more than locals? No, no way at all.
We do everything with our own hands.
You are a boy from your mother, from your father, from what we have never had, sir.
A supervisor gets upset with you while you're on duty.
We are the best people
Best country
Flawless
And thank you all
Shamkhurbat yesterday on the radio
Mom, I want some sweets.
There is nothing sweet except after dinner.
That's it, there's no sweetness.
The one who tore the shirt
Mom, Adoul and I were sitting and playing.
I know you're playing
But what tore my shirt?
God curse you, O Adoul.
Come, come, look at your brother's son, what did he do?
The one who told you there's no need to buy it expensive told me no, it's fine, a boy will turn out handsome.
See what I did
Cancel this, it's no use. This cancel the shirt, it's no use. I want to throw it away.
He said he'll do whatever I want, of course no one can stop him.
Mom, where is the sweetness?
Look at the crack in the workforce intentionally.
Walid returned and he is with him
Happy that he's wearing it for the first time
I'm in it, Barawij
Where are the elders?
In the garden
Why am I becoming?
There is a problem between us.
I hate it
Shame on your face
Just put it and go, people
And the child is left to do as he pleases
spreading corruption
Don't come, discipline me
Come, teach me
So, we are raising them.
About excessive mistake, respect yourself
Let it be between us
You guys are fighting, you kids.
Abu Ayd Bay Gulf, Mom
Mom, don't interfere at all.
Tell him, Irby, his children are fair. Listen, listen to me, you and him.
Oh, this one
Your words, I won't let you distinguish between the child and the stick.
I just found out
It's my fault, not yours.
Let's go upstairs.
These guys don't deserve one
Even I respond to them
It is preferable for one to
The Time of Gentle Hearts
That's it, that's it, Kani Yai Yai Yai, goodbye, goodbye
But Your Excellency, the minister requested the papers, and I think it's necessary.
That's enough, enough. I'm negotiating with the minister. Later, that's none of your business. I'm negotiating with him.
The calamity has struck, the disaster has struck, the catastrophe has struck.
His new clothes, no, oh Aisha
This is not an action, people.
And you are the sheet metal
No, no, oh, oh, the clothes are getting all messed up.
Guffy Guffy
It means there's no hope of you wearing it.
My cousin Joofi wears a traditional thobe, meaning he wears a single robe and goes out.
No, no, no, this is not it at all. This is not something you cut with your hand, I swear.
I tell you, inside a paradise with an electric saw
But I only say, God is sufficient for me against those who did it.
I am telling you
Who among you wants some sweetness? Come on over.
I also know
If you still want to get to know, go ahead and take a walk around the farm.
I'm not just in love with you because you like to ride a bike.
I love you because there's something else about you too
You say the truth is right
Alright, you want sweetness.
Oh, my father, two.
I give you four units
Who cut our clothes in the closet?
Ha, your father, how did he cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors to cut the car.
Under the bed, here is all the sweetness
He has not received these messages again.
No one else can do this trouble.
He deserves it; we keep silent about it.
The most important thing
We are committed to our words
I am dressed in clothes, Walid, oh people
What a computer
He is sitting and talking like this.
The destruction I saw with my own eyes, it's impossible, oh people, to do it.
Why don't you want to believe me?
Go around your circle, go
Zain, just give me a moment.
This is your situation
Every day, Mom, you argue.
Where are you, oh former time
Come on, with forgiveness and well-being.
May God guide you.
Yashil estimates a large scissors.
You're the one I'm looking for, your friends.
Look at the guy, mom
Going to bring a bigger scissors
Respect yourself, Sultan. Respect yourself, Oosh.
Oh Dad, come here, and whoever has mercy on my parents, go behind them. Come here, Dad.
How do I start
And each one of you
You are fathers
And the child is born
The baby is born
You are my brothers
Listen to my words and make peace, extend your hands
Alright, tell me what you're doing now.
Goodbye, bird. I tore their clothes.
They ruined their clothes because of this trouble they caused me, they lost my files, my information, my documents, they lost everything in the world.
I swear I won't leave him
Bring us a speech about museums, in Arabic language. I swear I won't leave it.
I have nothing to do with it.
Beats, beats, beats, beats until he gets tired and leaves
My brother Mab Saahi, I know him.
And each one greeted the other.
Not from his heart, father; not from his heart. This is his heart filled with hatred and resentment.
He is angry because I broke the computer.
With Fahd
Sultan Atta Atta Atta
Come on, Mom, fear God.
Give, give, be careful, be cautious
Take, uncle, your children and go play outside.
Come on, come on, may Allah set you right.
May Allah bless you
Each guy, each one is a little bit of a show-off.
What did you do to the seeds? What did you do to the children?
God willing, oh mother
Their brother, Abdulrahman
Maybe, Mom, it's the first time.
Do you know, Mom, it's the oud.
He knows how to argue with people
and he communicates with them
Don't be upset with me later.
You are the ones who are supposed to.
Each one has a role
May God set things right for you, but may God set things right for you.
Even you, Dad, have become like them.
Oh, Mom, Mom, hit my son. May God command us, may He guide us. And you keep saying, "Wreck, wreck, wreck."
And damn it, mother, yes.
My son, my other son, my son.
You let us down, guys.
Those who delete were the children, the children.
I'm not satisfied, I don't believe it
I understand them with both of my eyes.
I tell them, they don't believe this.
I say from above
Those are dry kids from above, Fultun, but because they are from above, maybe they are proud.
Hey, I'm not drunk, I'm awake.
Please, you can go.
Maybe you're a bit tired or your head is spinning.
Do you know who these people are?
Tell me, are you coming to throw stones at you?
Ommha S
Oh my beloved
I'm telling you, go and rest now. They already signed the pledge. What else do you want?
In the name of Allah, in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this? Come on, come on.
God is sufficient for me against the enemy
Mama, mama
It's all your fault
It's your fault.
Respect, but only for the young ones among you and your minds.
They took me to the hospital, I fainted, I was dying.
Oh, a pair, and it's not the first time I see it.
And note that he does not look at you, O Hazi.
He wasn't registered in the business with us.
But now it's been a week since he started attending the class with us.
It's obvious that he's going to die and he'll meet you.
Don't become a burden as long as I am forced to tolerate you to that extent.
No, my sister
He keeps saying about me that I am obsessed with him.
A son of dignity came to me, and I took a deep breath.
Let things become normal, it's better.
Now he's the one who chases after you and the one who sacrifices himself for you.
It means yes, I reciprocate the same feeling of admiration.
I just don't know, I feel like the right opportunity hasn't come yet.
Illiterate by illiterate
I destroyed it and looked at you, and I don't know how.
Come on, don't wait, young man. I'm coming. I'll tell you, please, I want to get to know you.
Hey brother, you take the initiative.
That's correct.
But I am waiting for the right opportunity
The right opportunity
More than just being registered with her in the same subject.
The teacher is tired
Say it, O Aflana
Hey Aflana, aren't you coming? Seriously, what's her name?
We've been waiting for three months, looking into each other's eyes.
And no one knows the other
My brother, you're not the same as before.
It means you need to go and tell her, please.
Can I get to know you?
Not to that extent anymore.
Mali, I need to wait for the right opportunity to come to me.
Calm and well-mannered
I swear, I don't know exactly what you want.
We finished filming the series yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
You never forgot us and you never let us down.
I am now free.
That we buy the land behind us, this is Walid's right.
I think tomorrow, God willing, if he gets married, I will take him so he doesn't go far away from us.
What's the point now anyway?
You are very late
And you are good news
I haven't been here for a few days; I came to her, and she's empty of her essence.
And they bought the land through the Development Bank.
God bless them, God willing, in it.
Hello, hello, Dad. Good morning.
Hey man, hit the selfie button.
Thank you, father. Thank you. May Allah reward you. May Allah reward you with goodness.
Hello, hello, Noura. Welcome, welcome. I worked hard on the car. I'll be waiting for you. Come, I'll take you. Come, come, sir.
And peace be upon you.
Good, what do you have?
Neighbors are sitting and insulating, and you, what do you care about between them?
I say, get out of there; it's better for you.
Neighbors are sitting together, and you, what are you doing among them?
I have a nice brother-in-law stuck on my car and I can't get it out.
Excuse me, excuse me, give me your car key.
After washing the car
I'll immerse you in the Titanic atmosphere you're living in.
Goodbye
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only knew Walid.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Sure, many people, if you tell them your father's name, will think you're the actor's son.
Mashallah, the same name
Actually, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashed Abdullah, the famous actor, your father
Why didn't you have dinner with them? Did anyone have dinner with these bushes?
Come on, tell me
How did you find out about the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, Yaruna?
Yes, yes, that's correct
Hey, my friend at university knows them, and she's the one who told me.
He loves him and loves to imitate him, and he only follows him.
He told me we no longer live with a famous person who has value in the community.
Oh my heart, oh my joy
Shahliila, Shahliila, his blood is light, yes indeed.
And his son turned out to be just like him, then he scared me. May God reward him well.
Whoever said it was right
He returned, Dritwa
I have to take a picture with this actor I love, you see why.
Mom, Haj, talk to Aboud, my cousin.
I am now reading his interview in the newspaper.
They say they are filming a series about the days of diving.
I say, from who I led, I bring you a lamb on the occasion of the new plow.
Prove that he is indeed a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
We have many names.
They told me, God bless you, the group, O Abu Saad, that my name is present.
And it is determined according to the need and the employee's experience
We don't know
Maybe I won't transfer you
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.
In the name of God, your enemy
We said we would move and stay before that, and until God provides for us, then we will decorate.
Adjust your work
He's back, Abu Ali
Please, don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need
I am at your service
The neighbor to the neighbor, and I am your brother
But I just heard and saw.
Zain, Mashallah, you know about furniture.
Oh, go away and come back
It's not your concern, my sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, tell me.
My love, Abu Jomad is applying for a loan, and if they approve it, we will sell all the furniture.
Here I am repeating it for the second time.
And I only hear the sound
We are considered the people today.
And this one, I don't know how to study, I go.
I just wanted her to rely on herself.
Sure, I was speaking to her.
It means I want to talk to you and tell you to speak to my friend.
Oh mother, oh Ali
It's nothing special.
Damn, she loves me and I love her. I get along with her.
You are dreaming
Let me propose to your cousin's daughter.
Leave the matter to me
As you like
You are a fool
Banjouf
Good night
And you are from Halah
Bouali Khair
Brother, this car is loud.
Every day and the next, you make up a story about me.
The girl has returned, may God bless you, she has a university.
And this one is always stubborn.
Your daughter is our daughter
It's none of your concern
There's no need to burden yourself, brother Ya Rashid.
There is no god, may Allah keep you safe
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting without work.
The Development Bank's branch is empty; your house and car are gone.
This is not our car.
House of the neighbor, Rashid Abdullah
The hollow relationships have evolved
We discuss topics of mutual interest that serve the interests of both parties.
Wow, this is an incredible development.
Let's go, walk.
Come on, Mom, it's embarrassing
I am not satisfied
Noura said, "I counted my daughter, and every day the Deryoul will pick her up from university."
Tell her that my dad's car has been in repair for a week.
No, by God, no way
She said, "No, Daryoul, he delivers it to her every morning."
Testimony to God, O Imam Ali
Nice people
No, no, Dad
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Yahi blouh, yahi blouh, shasawi ana al-hain
I have responsibilities and duties.
My daughter is going to university.
Yabu Ali, as long as your intermediary is Professor Rashid Abdullah
We can't say anything anymore, that's it.
Boussaad Boussaad
Bousaad, I am sorry
Bouali knows his worth with us
Thank you, may Allah reward you with goodness. You haven't fallen short, O Abu Saad.
They all love you, Mashallah
God, this is sweet, this is sweet
Come on, guys, Professor Rashed is busy. Let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashed. We didn't mean to bother you or anything.
At your service, we are here, we are here.
You have a strong connection with someone influential.
We are your quarter and your brothers; if you need anything or anything at all, oh God, oh God, be generous with us. Don't forget.
Just tell me where you want it, I’ll bring it to you.
Why do you make me angry, I get upset.
Are you proposing to me, Manal?
They agreed, Mom, they agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me
I'm so surprised, I can't believe it
Mother of Walid
And dresses you have a party
I didn't understand
The blessing is for Walid, God willing, a sight for sore eyes
She finally talked to me, poor thing.
Takes accessories
Ashdooh Jewelry Accessories
This is my mother
Now you're going to ride a fancy car.
Masha Allah, Masha Allah
Mashallah, I can't catch up.
Mother of Walid, I am with you now.
To everyone I gave you, I also gave you the car
And with her, the Drioul
If you go with this color, they won't believe that this beauty and sweetness are the queen's spouse.
Ambie Way
God willing, you will go with these clothes.
Oh no no no no no, I don't care about you.
Without my clothes, I leave you; you don't recognize me.
I say, oh, that sheikh who just came in on us.
Coffee is the right of the long-lived.
Bouali, I don't know you, I swear. I said this is definitely one of the cabarets. You're not Bouali, you're not Bou Ali.
What is your opinion?
And his walking is different afterward
God bless you, the two of us who are going to propose to Ali's family.
People of the big people
I managed to fix myself with the headband for the car.
I said, surely I will find it with you
The last series I acted in
In a scene that was a wedding, I remember any wedding
I was wearing that shiny black Beshte.
And I want you to teach me how to wear the bisht
Because your brother, God bless you, has never worn a bisht.
Mashallah, more and more beautiful
If I do this, I will be the first to join the group.
This is not fair.
I'm telling you, my brother Rashed
You don't have any buttons left.
Goodness
The one I always see with me, Khulood.
So, that's how it is.
Oh, you are my love
We are now family
And our daughter Noura doesn't want to go far away.
Noura is truly Waleed
Tell me, Mom, I see her at the university and I can't find anyone better than her.
This blessed hour
God willing, I will tell her father the truth, and may God bring what is good.
Why did they reject him? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor
The soul of your father's call
Quickly tell him, Rashid wants you.
Where are you?
Shout out of fear
Are you saying that because his father is an actor?
Aren't you ashamed of your beds?
I am an actor
But I am the most honorable.
I perform on stage for two hours, and then my role ends.
And my performance ends
You play roles
I represent
I give them a message that benefits them
But you all
I am wearing acting clothes
On the stage
But you all
You represented yourself in the gatherings.
The rich sheikh
Who is the actor among us
Who is the real actor
Don't be sad, Walid
Lift your head
We haven't had the honor.
But you missed the view now that I'm coming.
And I hear her shouting at him, don't pay attention, don't pay attention, poor thing, breaking his heart
And he walks, sir.
Are you saying Jannah is a horse?
It's Thursday, oh Riyal
This Thursday
His wife is not his wife
You're jealous of him.
That's why he walks like that
So that he neither sees women nor women see him
I saw how his wife trusted him.
Sir, do not look back
But tomorrow they won't be in the office.
Thursday, please, please, they are asking how the lady is dressed.
Thursday, help me with his stylish outfit
Isn't your wife called "Lobsa Alasti"?
Come on, it's Thursday already
I'm going to go and see Salim.
Poor guy, my brother
Until when will you stay like this?
If you could hear the things being said behind your back
Wow, Mashallah, even in front of me they say maybe even more.
Why do I do this?
I care about you
Are you jealous of what?
I spend hours sitting in front of the TV
This is it.
Oh, and I swear to God
No, it's okay
Peace be upon you, my sister
Pair of times
I swear I was in front of you, talking to her, and I heard the sound of a man.
By God, sometimes I take off my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her
It's hard to let her go
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing
I don't come close to me, I don't come close, stay away.
Hey, I missed you
My intention is good
You are my need from
No one ruins you except these types of people you sit with.
And especially this one, this one from the beginning of your friends, all of them are from Madaniyah, from the life of Allah, this two hundred Murburb.
With the young ones, on Sunday, the garden just started to grow.
The noble man who has no shame
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
After Ashandaj, say to me
You understand with whom
I'm not afraid of anyone here.
Hello, I hope you get well. What's going on?
Our friend Khamis is here
A little while until I watch the flood and I talk to myself.
No, I say the limping in his head jumps up and down.
It's just a Thursday, this poor guy.
Everyone sees that his mother is in front of him, and he is sitting talking to her.
God is sufficient for me against his wife
Do you have Thursday off?
He's busy right now with an international call, so much so that the line even got cut.
And what is this message about?
I say, may God help you, O Khamis.
What's wrong with you? You're not sleeping.
I don't have a note, I swear I don't know, maybe I didn't come to me.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow
With the women’s delegation at the ministry
Maybe, you know
God guide you, just Khamis
These names come from the office of His Excellency the Minister.
And then come over
You are really afraid of her.
If I argued with Salem, I wouldn't have been afraid.
The truthful statement
Why are you sitting and leaning against the water tank?
Just like that
K Kha Shafte Aqr Aqer Akher Raqm F Al L L Andij
Last number, huh
The last number you called after deleting the number of the girl you were talking to.
Tell me what her name is, oh man of women
Kill for kill for kill for
Killed her, Hajji Salem
Hello my friend, in work.
You didn't believe me, brother.
And then, what are you wearing?
I intend to go diving
By God, brother, she didn't let me wear it. She told me to go out like this.
Call me
My wife’s father called.
Haj Murti
Say it, brother: give me the pen, I'll give you the number.
They are in charge of some of you.
This is your nature, you guys.
You are one like Loti, but I will show you.
If you interfere again, only the Minister's office will respond to me.
This is a horse.
And he threatened me, saying that he would complain about me to the minister's office.
This is really bold.
She is planning to cut off my livelihood, you know.
But I am the one who is wrong for obeying you and calling her.
Inside the hollow of 'Aad, O Khamees
If she complains about me at the minister's office
Come with me there and tell them the whole story. They made me leave the story, right?
I have nothing to do with it.
You are a desire.
My brothers and sisters
Good morning to you all
And I am honored by your attendance at the meeting
But where are the rest then?
Knock and run away
Where is Thursday?
Yes, Your Excellency
Phone sugar
Alright, don't lock it, leave it in the office.
The entire meeting is one hour.
This is not my phone.
It became and it was settled.
Since that day, I've been sitting with you and haven't gone to their house.
Where does he go
He can't go.
Zack is still in the same situation today.
Jealous, jealous of him, she's jealous.
My love, this is not anyone else's.
Yills Ahni in the hall at night with his soul
Tell me, I chat with my mother.
The mother, the mother is dead
That's why your father is upset so I can see if there's a solution for me.
Madam, I asked you to move from the department where the women are.
Is it a military judgment?
Akka Jovi, I sign it, I grow up, read below
My brother, please, I am transferred to the Social Care Department.
Are you sure they transferred you to the Care Department?
Why strange
Thank you, may God keep you safe.
You are the sister. Sorry, brother Khamis.
They contacted us, the minister's office, and informed us.
Your new department has arrived
And who is with you, your friends, at the office?
Isa, Saleh, and Jassim and
Oh Thursday, yesterday the minister decided to transfer you.
And today they supported you in your new department.
And I explained to you, I told you my problem with the family.
You are a transformed decision-maker, Minister.
It means I go to the minister.
Today he took his annual leave.
And he won't return except after a month and a half.
Yahi Warta
And I also want my opinion to be heard
Minister, you and I say the same thing
I'll keep looking for a place for you because this time I told you because they told him a lot about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth
And the solution
Their saying is: when the woman contacts me, don't argue.
And what do you think? Maybe I can persuade them, you know.
I made them put all the toys in the car; I put them in a box.
A single marble
I gave you ten assuming that you are five in the office, meaning each one has two.
Oh, look at him, he's afraid of his wife because he's emotionally attached to her.
Imagine us all named Abasami Riyaeil
And I call myself Abd al-Ghadir
And that's how he is.
And he is handsome and cute, I mean, so I would be worried about him like this.
In the name of Allah, what is this that heals her?
Call me when you say so
Hey Abdulqadir, the one sitting here is Hassan, the one from your side sitting behind Khalil.
This game, each person chooses what they want.
This is my grave
Joy is silent.
What's wrong with you, I become
Please
Where is the care office?
There are supposed to be five female employees.
What is your name?
I am sweet
Who am I, my wife is my wife
Who am I
You just finished the project in front of us.
And we met with them
So, what did they say to you?
They said
You're shining, the one coming to you is this one.
I can't
He entered the kitchen and got scolded.
Come on, come on, come on, my soul, let's go, we're coming, come on
Come on, come on, come on, you idiot
Come on, come on, listen to the men's words, listen to them
Come on, did you forget that we are Bani 'Aqrab?
Come on, come on, and I am coming without thanks. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The bank officials said that there are no issues with the project.
His phone is all busy when he calls him.
Poor things from Messa'ah are waiting for you
And I am afflicted with a calamity other than this man and these brothers.
My servant traveled for a month, and now it has been three months.
Allah, Reem, oh God, goodbye
And all my amendments are for our benefit.
Boy of the sky
Oh, just so you know, if you make the garden
At least he'll go somewhere for at least two or three days.
They say that the garden is considered a refuge for the people living in this complex; this is the bank.
Men are sitting and discussing; they don't need women's opinions.
Keep your opinion to yourself
You put the next one, and I found you, show yourself, break free.
No garden
Just a minute
My sister, you know that I love football.
My mother and your brothers don't know you're playing soccer at school; if they found out, they would kill you.
Get to know yourself
She said to her.
I say forget the issue, it's better for me.
And do not harm yourself
Lalalalala, I have you on my mind.
What can I say, the worries of this world
You are our blessing, Hajjaj Ali.
Oh, Uncle Shahin, we have it.
Masha Allah
This is Thursday
Length and width
Fear of the dishdasha
I was looking for a wife for him and couldn't find one.
Origin and essence
I'll tell you something
Thursday wedding at my place
This is from the Resources Department
Yes, long live your age
Leave it aside
Then I have a few notes on the suggestion.
May your life be long, Amraj.
Do you have anything else?
May your age never end
Take care of them, and if I find the time, God willing, I will meet with them.
What did you do to the female employees I sent to you?
Good, it happens
I'm going now and then I'll call you, okay?
What's up?
Who are you, Minouna?
We are your older sisters.
We are suffering, woe from long ago
You know, ask Fatoum what sport she plays at school.
They killed him with a ping-pong table
They just slaughtered her, that's all.
The hit that you are coming with is appetizers
You don't know who we are.
What is our origin?
Do you know what a clock hand means?
This time we messed up and got angry
Great Scorpion
Pointer
Come on, uncle, let's give her a slap on her face.
That's enough for her.
You stay as a reserve for later.
My change is not as good as my architectural engineering.
My intention is you
Scorpions don't have daughters working in the streets among the men.
Geometry, structure, and strength
Where is my friend, and here I am among the scorpions, where?
Let me break my head.
No, no, Sultan, no
Yes, sir, Scorpio Oud
Took your mother Fatoum
Let your brother Saqr take his chance.
By God, it's a shame for what they are doing.
My dear Ma'ali, at least you are a hand.
I am very tired.
Alright, why do they want you tomorrow morning?
Still gray
Shador, ya Saqr, come down
Come on, in front of me, in front of me
Where will I go
No word
زين وين رايحين
We told him, "Come" or "Say a word."
And you write instead of it "upbringing"
And even praise, if you want, we have no objection.
It's getting dark.
You have two options.
So you know that we are democrats
Are you saying that we pressured you?
Either praise or upbringing
Come on, let me down my hair.
Bring us a copy of the order.
Come on, Zulfie, Zulfie
Big scorpion, oh father
The scorpion, the oud, and the ink pen have spoken to you.
I won't fall short, Uncle, but when is the rain, God willing?
Teacher Amunira
What you ask for, I see it as very difficult
I can't travel, Abu Khaled
I have personal circumstances
The minister assured him.
Very difficult
My mind is correct, O Amunira
Don't make a decision now, think about tomorrow.
So, how come your daughters are working?
That's why we're silent
I have a suggestion
Let one of them travel with you.
We don't have any girls to travel.
Turkish, what is this mess?
Neither modest nor shy
It's us who have been working until now.
Then you go and apologize
When I do not hesitate
My hearing, and you're silent
Khamis from the children of Al-Aqarib
Among us and within us
Yeah, he's stupid and doesn't have a certificate.
Just a scorpion
Sister, what are you doing now?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak
How much should I do?
There's nothing I can do.
She is fighting with her.
Thursday, God willing, the gathering.
We will contact you and tell you what time to come based on Sheikh's group that will be hosting.
Oh, this smile is sweet
The soul has prepared clothes for you.
Soul, change your clothes, oh father
That laughter is killing me.
My brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Make us tea, coffee, and cake.
I have never seen you before, Aisha, I have known you since the time of the Minister's friend.
I'm afraid it might be just a rumor, O Abu Khalid.
Amira Marsha candidate holding a ministry in the new cabinet formation
Amira deserves it
God willing, it won't be just a rumor.
You start work tomorrow
And we all cooperate to serve the homeland
Through each of our contributions in our respective positions, thank you all.
And I wish us all success
Thank you, Minister's effort.
Thank you, the barley heat, the minister's effort
Thank you
May she live longer, please, please.
Peace be upon you
Oh, with soap afterwards, just as you told me.
This is the general supervisor of the women's national football team.
Ask him how your sister Fatima played.
In the name of Allah, what Allah has willed, Allah is the Greatest
Captain Fatima is a pioneer in her own way.
Captain Fatima is talented, oh my brothers. Goodbye, my son.
Captain, what do you think about my sister's playing? What is her position?
Just a headbutt, that's all.
You are traveling to China
Captain Jannah Abayid, a little bit of China
May God grant you success
Your sister is playing an important match.
She was studying education, but today I went and transferred her papers.
A couple studying together with an architect.
Hey captain, there's no difference between the man and the woman.
I swear, just pour the coffee, just pour it.
Come on, where are you going
A Aziz and I am waiting
You're an idiot, you're an idiot
Come on, come on, go and greet your mother, tell her they fired me.
Come on, come on, not your father, not your mother’s father
By God, his condition
The dallah you have has cooled down.
They don't know the length of the year; as soon as they hear that you have work,
Hello, how are you? How are the kids?
I missed her.
I swear to God, this time you will be with us in the series.
Of course, and you play the hero's role.
Inside, O Ali, Nauf's turn; no one plays it but Shou'la.
My love, there's something called makeup that makes her look younger.
Maryam, twenty-six, I don't know, twenty-seven, ring
Let him turn it on, Dad, you'll benefit.
He keeps giving us lectures that have neither beginning nor end.
I'm afraid that a bone might get stuck in our pharynx.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know that the company producing the series is yours and Hamed's.
God willing, I won't be late, my brothers.
And Kaho Rashid and my opinion afterwards
The director is ready with his technicians.
Alright, guys, just because of the time, let's start the meeting.
Whoever wants to speak, say their opinion, please.
Jenk Hamed, do you want to say something?
Honestly, I don't think there's anything better than this series.
Come, you day this servant committed suicide.
And you know, which scene affected me the most
The maid commits suicide
One day, she hung herself on the bank, the bank kept shaking, shaking, shaking, and blood was pouring out from her neck.
She found him and started yelling at her son, I swear, it's an action.
And he keeps hitting him and hitting him and hitting him until he reaches his house.
Action Peak
The police are searching, they are catching the mother.
Honestly, the series is extremely wonderful.
You just act out the series; when you get up from the table, you act it out.
This is an assault on the artistic conscience
And the violation of societal values
A series based on abnormal events
Unbelievable
Seventy-two murder cases series
What’s this fuss all about?
You're actually known for not wanting anyone to find out.
Elevate, elevate, oh brother Hamed, let's be democratic.
We will settle the matter with the majority.
Oh brother Nasser, I do not hide behind the majority and democracy; in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work, there is no democracy or majority.
You got involved, you judge your government job in the matter.
Goodbye
I tell you, I heard the sound of the bell.
And on the day she went out, an Indian was in his hand, Jis
He asks me, I tell him, "You are Mama Hessa." I said to him, "Yes."
What did you open, the army?
He found a ring that I think is worth around seventy or eighty thousand.
I'm afraid Halaindi might bring us these things by mistake.
No, no, not by mistake
This is Samira
Hamed's responsible wife who is with us at the company
And this is Allah's gift to you from me.
What is your name?
The ring is very luxurious
I've never dreamed of having the same ring.
Congratulations, may God bless you, Hessa, my dear.
This is my father. I call this series the series of goodness.
Ali and Hamid are the employers, but since they are our employees, they cannot present the series in their names, so they presented it in whose name?
And what else besides this ring?
I'm just saying, but don't let it come between us.
Who is he talking about? I am telling someone.
Your clever husband
The one they call the magician
He asked for five in the hundred, a little.
No, my love, it's fine if they agree to four million.
Your husband is getting two hundred thousand nice riyals
I say the role of the university girl is to give Nada.
Here, I love being with one and wandering with him on a bicycle.
Our series that we are working on is called "Rape of the Conscience."
They called me again about a role in a series.
Okay, I want to know one thing
Our Gulf series are always like this, I mean, as I say, the trend this year is rape.
The important thing is, tell me, my love, what will be my role.
And you too, my love, Dorj, one hundred percent, guaranteed
Zain, stop embarrassing me.
Kani Yay Yay now
My love, I'm coming back now to make all this sweet breakfast for you, you'll stay with me and then you'll leave.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect us
He never asked for me at this time
And he said that this series they are making is weak and trivial.
It's forbidden to lose money on it.
Zain, and then I mean, what happened?
God protect me, what should I tell them? I mean, I'm afraid that Rashid, this fool, told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid, you.
Leave this matter to me
The human is a healer
Social Series
I just saw this a few days ago on TV.
No, Your Majesty
The series currently airing is called "Rape," and its fruit has not yet been plucked.
But the budget they are requesting is very large.
It needs a large budget
Then don't forget, may God bless you, that the organization producing the work is a local organization.
May God bless you. I will recite and dedicate it to her.
Rest assured, Your Highness
I read the technical page
These days we hear about the start of filming the series "Rape of the Conscience."
And a huge budget was allocated for him.
While it is said that the series is not up to the required standard
And the other says that the series is a school for teaching deviation.
They might stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, hello, Abdulhamid.
Hello, hello, welcome, welcome, rest well
Good morning
Good morning, hello
I am journalist Eli Munir and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, please.
Yeah, I'm just going to rest a bit because he has a meeting.
Mercury makes us utilize design and create cosmic space.
And by the way, we will contact all the correspondents around the world to get in touch with us.
This is your job now.
Otaard Company for Artistic Production
and discuss its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works in the history of the world
Are you serious? Who wrote this stuff?
If you have no shame, do as you wish
The eye feels shy
Is it reasonable that we have journalists like this?
The journalist's duty is to have principles.
Come here with you.
What are they coming to record positions for?
Yesterday I met you, Sha'ulah, the minister's envoy. Do you know my troubles?
I tell you, our series is very intense, very intense, and its events are strange.
Tonight is the first episode, and I will watch it with the people
Oh Mother, Ashraij
Oh, Mom, my patience is running out; this is only the first episode.
Wow, I haven't heard anyone talk to themselves except in Gulf TV series.
Then my mother said, "Should I go slaughter my children? Only if they are with you."
Oh my son, art is about taste, not about strange cases that you bring up and generalize to society and people.
Mom, this might be in the visual arts, but in drama, it's completely different.
Oh, I don't want to hurt my head.
It seems that the Turks are evident to him.
No more, Dad, don't control me now; at least, watch the first five episodes.
The series is a failure
And it's forbidden for our children to be involved in these things
Tell him, my brother, he's not that much.
There are series worse than him and they are shown.
Actually, this work, O Abu Salem
I swear, it's your fault
And every house supports him
Go and get the people who understand the dimensions and secrets of the lines
And present it to them
We are not for us.
They perform Hajj, they become.
The minister came with his guests.
I went to greet him.
But we're the ones who agreed to the series.
Let him enjoy it, Your Excellency the Minister.
Zain, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
And my colleague is the one who insulted.
I only post messages that praise the series.
No, no, don't worry at all.
Tomorrow I will see what is written, and I will post messages from myself thanking the series and praising, and I will be the first to say that these readers sent.
God willing
You can only be happy
For this year
We agree with him.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama
They all agree with the minister's efforts.
I'm walking with you, agreed with the journalists
Headings, just the headings
I wish for the re-rape of conscience
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series.
I wish they would redo it again.
The Minister's office was the first to contact me.
This is the remaining amount of money for your series, we have paid it for you.
They don't blame you for being called the magician
They still haven't found anything.
Honestly, we just invested our money now and made a profit, and the profit was excellent.
And then, you know, the series is a failure.
The author himself is talking to me, saying he's sorry.
I'm coming now to suggest a second part of the series.
The minister is between you and me
The story about the press and the false success we achieved.
And he told me he's not comfortable inside from the series.
It means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part.
If the minister himself does not request a second part
I cannot
But I repeat my thanks
To all employees
In this series
And I congratulate them on their victory
what they deserve
The truth is that winning this work with these awards at these prestigious festivals
He is the greatest proof
Why do you say that?
A tough guy appeared.
The golden prize is guaranteed, a hundred percent literacy.
Ask him/her yourself
Tell me, readers, where are they deceiving us, and the press, where are they deceiving us?
Tell them there's a second part, why doesn't he say it?
As long as you have these Arab TV festivals and Gulf ones, do some art washing.
The art of washing
I hear about money laundering.

What are we going to do with One Two?
What are we going to do?
We are the ones who signed the contract with them; they must comply.
Write to them
Our products are exported abroad, including all types of bread, small and large, triangular, and assorted.
We are mute, signing the contract with them.
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of the roti
They asked you what product he makes.
By God, they told me about the roti, but I don't know what is made of in the roti.
God bless you, my dear Roti Abgarar
You call it lazy.
I mean, instead of taking this bread that you call a bun.
This is the inventor's idea, Easahla.
Roti Jeans
This secret
You eat the roti with the stew
Man, these guys do some crazy stuff.
This paste is made with a special method so that as soon as you put the paste, I will melt it for you.
And different flavors are available: cheap strawberry, cheap strawberry, cheap caramel, cheap coffee
You know how much I am an investor in this project
Three million dollars with patent rights
Come, Samah
Yes, Abu Nasser
At your service
We took her to the river, oh long-lived one.
What I say, Samah
Take them, your son Nasser, yesterday so they can play soccer with the team he formed.
I agree with him
This team does what they can, but only in terms of security and drivers.
And then we consider ourselves short because, Mom, we only have one guard; if he gets injured, we'll be in trouble.
And it is supposed to be that I have a fan relationship.
And the day you took the employees, as your mother said, seventeen.
I have something to tell you.
About the important people in the company
The one who shapes the company's heart
The baker took my hospital dough.
Therefore, I am very worried about the boy.
You have a flaw; it’s not acceptable. You are from a well-known family, you shouldn’t go around causing trouble and embarrassing us in front of everyone.
Whoever wants to play with them can do whatever they want.
But he only takes the important people who shape the company's heart
Shasawi, Mom, my team has a match and I am missing four players.
We don't want excuses
What happened, happened now
Hamedy didn't come to work today, teacher.
I rode with him.
He told me to get dressed
And they brought me and stopped me in speech
The match seemed
Next, I didn't feel anything
They tell me that a ball came and rolled on me, but I don't remember.
So you used to play as a goalkeeper.
Just for Nasser's sake
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
God willing, we will be tested with the ball and with these nonsense.
From today, Nasser
There is no such thing as a ball.
Your team, the one you made yesterday, cancel it.
All the bakers returned to the bakeries
And what do you think?
Hey, the topic
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I asked you, Abu Nasser
Let's hear what the boy has to say, please. I beg you.
Just for you, Abu Ahmed
I see what you say.
Tonight we have the last match in the tournament that we are playing in.
Don't hurt his feelings, O Abu Nasser. Please, I beg you, I beg you.
Come on, guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Good good good, congratulations
Hey, Professor Nasser, I want you to come quickly.
God bless you, my team was on point today
Professor Naser Lazim
You promised us you would throw a party.
I want you to call and book a hall at the hotel.
And once I make the journalists and newspapers happy there.
No, Rashid, I'll do it at our place in Al-Mails.
Because my father, who has dried up happiness, the players, and the victory, might allow the team to continue.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup
God only hears from you.
Lala saw him taking pictures with the players and having a press interview with them this morning.
Wako Jannah Sami, the math page editor, will have a meeting with him.
What picture
Don't go far away from me
Come on, take a good picture.
You tell me you're not happy
What is your opinion on the victory of your sons, the bakers? I mean the players, with this great achievement.
With a fighting spirit
and effort
And loyalty to the bakeries
Bo Nasser, I mean, no offense, we watched the bakery team throughout the cycle, they were scoring four-four-two.
And loyalty to the bakeries and the coach's plan
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser
May God keep you safe
This is the guard
The one who sings the league and cup songs is coming to meet with you.
This tail is not for the council.
They sent you their representative to meet with you.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup
We are still encouraging the youth
God willing, I testify that you will see him in the future.
Yes, goodbye
Mashallah, your phone never stops, and I take your picture in the newspapers. Bless you, this ball is blessed.
You know what I was talking about.
He lowered the price of the engines again and told us, "Tamer, Abu Nasser, the ball."
So now you're famous, and the newspapers only publish your pictures with the caption "The first sportsman at the international bakeries."
I am far from the ball
What is this talk?
Since I was young in middle school
The one I was playing football with
Are you saying I should stay away from football?
As long as the one next to me is playing football, I am close to the ball.
It means I am close to mathematics, I mean I am a mathematician.
So, we are no longer international bakeries; we have become international stadiums.
Yesterday I heard him say he wants to make a gym.
Of course, and today we meet at the sports corner in the international bakeries, Uncle Nasser
To develop football
Of course, we talked before the match. I want to know your predictions and before you reach the platform.
The match is difficult today
And the team that controls the midfield line will have the upper hand today.
God willing, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud. Listen to me now, truly, truly, may God bless him, truly, truly, may God bless him.
Listen to me, Dad, the deal that was lost was about the players, the shipment that came to us.
We didn't benefit anything.
When I gave you the prices
The prices at which we sell to the world.
So, how come? The Gulf is not like the rest of the world.
Of course not
This is not your business
All you have to do is let me know when the Gulf buyer arrives.
Keep your fax machine open
Two defenders, one midfielder, and one central midfielder.
Look, my dear, I'm telling you, the four players.
Three of them are the head
Two hundred thousand
He took all the dollars at once.
How much do you get? Six hundred thousand. I will give you that in cash—five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Sweet, now this is for the Africans, now we come to the Brazilian.
This is the player of the season, this is his salary, one million and two hundred thousand dollars.
They set this price just behind me, I come and fax it to you and show it to him, he's inside for a moment, I come inside and fax. May God keep you safe from the club in the Emirates.
You are the owner of the gamble, and your gamble is your own.
Thank you
Wow, check it out, check it out, the man's chicken.
How are you?
The knee the knee
The knee, the whole knee
We won't be fooled again, whether it's an ACL injury or something else.
Oh, Abu Nasser
What is this adductor muscle?
Maqsab, I served them with Mufattah. God, you did not fall short.
Honestly, Abu Nasser, you did well. I mean, good players, the Brazilian and the African, with God's blessing, with God's blessing.
God bless you
I say the warehouse, the warehouse, these two boxes, come on, the warehouse
Mashallah, you have another business.
Lalalalala, just players only
Hollow Inzelon cartons
Bara'em, yes, Bara'em, I nurture them from where? From the jungles of Africa.
Yes, why not?
Karem has one cartoon hero.
This is a human like us
I'll tell you, a bud, I haven't heard it.
I tell you, these are just nonsense.
Now that we are
Why don't you give us this little sprout of theirs, some publicity with them?
I only want to say, my father Abu Nasser, right now, if you take care of him, raise him, and nurture him, it will benefit you.
Then the team will go later, then Hurr Hada in the stadium
Come come come come
Little by little on him, little by little on him, you see, he's considered soft, soft.
Put it in the appendix, Airplane. Goodbye.
Anything you need, all the players are with me.
If the coach who owns this understands
We are two zero, I dominate the match.
Dad, this is a coach in Spain.
I'm not really fond of it
The successful coach
Who organizes the traffic during the match
The north, for example, this is a line opposite to the Warka line.
Honestly, this coach of yours, I can't leave him as he is.
Hey, hey, the coach has been with the team for less than two months.
We need to find a solution with him.
If he understood football, he wouldn't just stay on the sidelines all match; he would attack from the center.
Hey, sitting on the offside relying on the offside trap.
Oh, mother, and whoever greets you, don't hurt my head.
The supposed one pulls the economic one, my father.
And he put Shinamu, Habbaba, Hetaowalahta, Hawaawa, and he left them.
No no no no no, I don't want to play
Shololu Habibo Taba Lava Khalla Iwli
Any line
According to the plan
And forget about these worries
It doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be between the manager and the team coach.
The star of the match today and the star of the team is scoring a super hat-trick. Well done, Jekulamanando!
What do you mean, we don't understand football?
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home
No, I can't get there by car. The bakery is closed; let him take a taxi.
That's none of your business.
Come on, stay with me on the line
That's just like what my father did.
Asfar, the coach, made us sit like this.
What is he going to do next?
The team destroys
Say hello to our team
Oh mother, oh mother
No, I'm not awake, I mean, tell her to come, you're divorced, tell the truth, what happened between you two.
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother I didn't like this guy.
I feel like it's not my responsibility.
Let's forget about the excessive talk and the empty words.
The true spirit of your father, and find out from him the story—why did your daughter get divorced?
I swear I will tell you, brother Rashid
But what was the reason he divorced her then?
No, it's not allowed, O Abu Abdullah. We need to know why the girl got divorced; it's our right to know.
Please, I don't interfere; it's none of your business.
No matter what I do, the man is sitting in the clinic, coming to find out why his daughter got divorced.
He who does not get to know him cannot appreciate the husband nor respect his feelings.
And who is this Barcelona?
You can't blame me for not knowing Spanish.
Barcelona, this is not alone
This is Guardiola's team
So now I'm going to the guy who's sitting at the mall waiting for me.
If you don't go, I will go. Okay, stay here. I'll get out of it. You, I don't know, raise your daughters.
Don't slam the door, I didn't mean to offend you like that.
Isn't it enough that she left FC Barcelona?
Messi, the football magician, scores a hat-trick every match he plays.
Maradona, the one who is Maradona, said that Messi is better than me.
And your daughter, who has no shame on her face, will make a mistake against him. Just watch.
Your daughter is neither a Barcelona fan nor one of our kind.
Why is this your talk?
Listen to me, may God guide you
So that your intention is that I give birth
He goes to apologize to her and makes her happy.
I am so
And then, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
Ashkhaneh Aflousna, if only we could make our children happy there.
Yeah, but come on now
The condition is that I propose to you a girl who is a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not upset.
You don't understand, Mom. Forget it, she's gone to hell.
Here you go, here you go, Mom
Do you even know, Mom? They are the ones who are losing.
You are the only one I wish for.
Here you go, Mom
It's forbidden, you broke my heart.
Poor girl, she hasn't been out for two days.
After marriage, it only lasted one month, oh unfortunate one.
Why are you guys trying to get me involved with him?
Mom, I don't want to get into trouble with him.
And who told you these nonsense that don't make sense?
I have nothing to do with her.
You don't know if this guy is the father of the child.
What is this?
Only her livelihood
You told me about the building I wanted to buy and turn it into a furnished apartment hotel.
Oh, the one in Mansoura
His father's right means that tomorrow, when his son takes our daughter, I will ask him for the building.
And if you cannot
Talk to her brother
Listen to me properly
There is a guy whose father is a millionaire
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire?
The opportunity does not come twice.
You know that because of their excessive arrogance, they have a palace in Spain just to stay there every year.
Well, and the story of Barcelona, what does it mean?
The people of the neighborhood spread this rumor about him to prove that their daughter is innocent.
And if we assume that the story is true and the guy really loves Barcelona and has loyalty to Catalonia
His wife is supposed to respect this.
And don't get the team wrong
This is if we assume that the story is true
Salmag Allah Abu Hu is called Bou Borjin because he has two towers on the Corniche.
I make them in a strange way like this, with the rope wrapped around each other.
People whom they have kept away from afar, do they think they are a single fortress?
My work has come, good has come
Oh, may God bless those who came to us
God bless you, dear. If you need anything, just tell me. God bless you.
Thank you, darling
Just let me know, Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, O Umm Abdullah, don't worry, O my eye's gaze
If I search for the Gulf Cooperation Council, I won't find anyone better than you.
Yallah, tell them to come back and give us their estimates for building the building.
I'm done now; you may command, Your Majesty.
Are your family members calling you?
See their wedding requests, prepare the check, and I will sign it.
In the name of Allah, what Allah has willed. In the name of Allah, what Allah has willed. May I have your permission, sir, after you. May I have your permission.
After Abdullah's divorce reply
God willing, the children and wealth will come, God willing.
God bless you, my aunt
You wear it because of the cold
Oh, I just don't know where my mom booked us.
Mom, I’m asking where you booked for us.
My mom says she booked us for Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia? Come on.
Goodbye
No one from the honeymoon period is crying.
Heal me, oh mother, tell me
Tell me, what's going on, Mom?
Waed Jaeefa herself, Mom
She sees herself, why?
Proud, let her go to me
Oh mother, you did well by making her the daughter-in-law of her family.
You broke my heart
Hi, Mom
Well, what's wrong with her like this?
What's wrong with her?
God bless you, don't forget to bring us and you from Spain olive oil.
Hey Spain, where are we going?
Oh, well then
My mom says she booked us for the Maldives.
It's okay, Mom, Maldives is beautiful afterward.
And at the same time, I go to entertain you with blessing, God willing, with blessing.
Now I said you're returning happy from the trip.
The one who hurts my liver, mother, why does he take the children?
Come and take the bag
What are they doing among themselves?
What's bothering you, my eye's gaze?
Be quiet, you and whoever is bothering you, you're teaching me about my son again.
How are you, Mom? What's bothering you?
I get depressed when I see the shells
No one who bothers you, Mom, will live.
Just leave her to me, just divorce her, divorce her, don't worry about her, your father has a lot of money, and the girls have a lot.
Be quiet, you and whoever else bothers you, my son, and I know him well. Underneath, there's nothing wrong with him, and he doesn't deserve to live in distress.
Go, Mom, call her and divorce her.
May God help her with it.
Yeah yeah say it three times
You are divorced moment by moment. Don't be surprised; there are still two more times after this.
Divorced, divorced
Honestly, I'm really nervous.
Come on, Mom, go, my dear, go and rest, and never carry the worry in your mind. The girls are on their own, as they say, go, Mom.
Oh, no problem
Just because Shafouj was at the dance.
Ring him, ring him, let me talk to him.
He shouted at me, "Mom, enough, divorce me," he told me, "You're divorced, divorced."
He deserves to be released; the one who is shameless and truly has little manners.
Now she's gone alone, the dance is over, what does that mean?
And once, when necessary, I shook it; there's nothing wrong with it.
It's nothing. What does it mean that the world has turned upside down?
I was surprised that I didn't go home now, wash my clothes, and then he wouldn't know that you're a girl from
I, I, oh Bo Abdullah, my daughter is getting divorced.
My daughter is getting divorced
She produces a feather on her head
You sell them and buy them from Toys "R" Us stores
Just as I burn, I now ignite over my daughter and my nerves.
And the only thing they did was nothing, poor things.
I have the apple peeled for you, take it.
It's normal for you to shoot at them however you like.
He is considered to be worth a real.
This is normal for you, sixty is fine, let him say whatever he wants.
Drink from the glass that God's creation drank from.
And what your soul does not desire for you
Do not show it to people
Do you know whose this complex belongs to?
And in a strategic location
Just leave it to God.
No, a trivial price afterwards
I'm standing still
I need to get Bo Saqr's approval
Yes, sir, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to him the week before last; they told me I was traveling.
I only want tomorrow, only after tomorrow. I am currently standing still. The problem is, I need Bu Saqr's approval, I must have it.
Soul to the Milas
No no no no, this is official work
His place is God, may He bless you, the office is not the house
After eating
Return, Abu Saqr, what are you so full of?
Listen, everyone has a key.
Tell me, Bo Fahd
You don't know him.
Tell me about him. I only see him on TV, and you didn't tell me that you're going with him on the pilgrimage.
It's just that we don't have that knowledge between us.
May God cut off your stories.
God, guide you, and you haven't even paid back the debt. At least, ask about this determination.
After that, there's an occasion. May God guide you.
The month has thirty days and he cooks dinner fifty times.
I suggest, Your Honor, that they include you in the Guinness Book of Records.
The most skilled in the world makes dinner.
Should I say who this brother is that you have with you?
Hello, may it be the happiest hour, I swear.
It is our honor, Your Majesty.
Oh, come on, Bu Falah
Are you saying that Abu Saqr cooks dinner every day?
This is what I see
But, O Abu Falah, tonight's dinner is a special occasion
Today, God bless you, your son is Saqr.
Mashallah, he deserves it, long live your age, with blessings.
Good news, son of the good-hearted. Regarding him, welcome, father.
Peace be upon you
What is he back to?
By the way, tomorrow Saqr and my son Imar will go to the agency and choose the car they want.
A year and a half I have been waiting for approval
Current halt
But only when I reached him
And his misfortune
God, guide you, just, O Abu Saad
Things don't turn out like this
He is dead, that's it.
He enters the showroom and chooses the car he likes.
We buy him three
I'll take you there
I am Abrohi Amodini Lah
Don't tell me that you met him during the Umrah last year.
Today, his son Shahin the Little
That was his game in the evenings
This is your chance
Bless him and grant him blessings.
He deserves safety, long life.
Oh Shahin or Abu Saqr
God bless you, thank you all.
Thank God for your safety, our son Shaheen, long life to you
May Allah bless you and
Except for the brother
As long as your life lasts
You didn't recognize me
By God, I sacrifice myself for your charm.
I was with you during the long life pilgrimage, long live the year.
Until I mention, I bought a red rosary.
I am God, peace be upon you
I was in the hospital
I will visit one of our relatives.
And I am honored to meet you
Hey, Saqr, I'm still hesitant whether to enter the field of commerce or not.
I will go with him, brother.
Why, oh father, Falcon, commerce is good.
You never put yourself in an office and a cavity.
Bu Saqr
Long life, don't refuse me and say "done."
What is he back to?
I have a falcon gift.
Full circle
And when commerce loves you and comes to you, you will tell her I am not coming.
Someone like you today has everything available to him. You took the license, thank God, and the world has opened up for you—no car payments and the best office on the Corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz told your father that if Saqr wants to enter the business, he should join me as a partner with fifty percent.
Mom, how do I balance between business and university?
Mom, don't make me do something I don't like.
And Mashallah, you have no agencies, offices, or travel agencies at all.
Opportunity, my son, in this time now, he starts his trade without capital.
Your capital is people's love for your father.
Stay smart and invest it.
Trust me, my son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Oh Lord, prepare the lunch quickly.
Mashallah oo oo oo oo oo has finally arrived for the rent and the pepper
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything. Tomorrow, I'm afraid he'll take the samboosa agency.
The hollow boy opened himself up for business.
This is what you were begging me to tell you today.
Tell me, Mom, I want to expand more in investment.
He wants to go to the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And the envious eyes stay away from him
Bo Sultan, yesterday he told me your son just started the business.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and stakes in two banks.
And I gave him the elbow, the stubborn one who neither wants a certificate nor a breath.
It seems, and Allah knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Oh, what's going on in the northern area of our office?
I'm just thinking about him.
God bless you, congratulations, Abbas
In the name of Allah
May God bless you
As much as regret benefits, it is easy.
What, dad, what a whole year of hardship and fatigue. Get the supermarket ready.
What's the story? The one who appears is coming every day to the dam.
This secretary named Samir is giving me a hard time.
Tell me, this Saqr, son of Bou Saqr, wants to partner with you instead of taking the place from you.
After his hand, a partner with you
There is no power nor strength except with Allah.
But after I see you, you start flirting with him, right?
He asked me who the brother is
Killed him with a stick.
Why do you say you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking past this shop, there was no small sign that said what, what was written on it?
Maktoub Bakery Al-Fareej
No, I want a different name
And peace be upon you
So, how's the work with you?
God willing, Your Excellency, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will complete the workers' housing plan for Al-Mustaqbal Company.
Lala Monsieur, she is my lady, Elisa. I know you, Monsieur. Monsieur is the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company's cars.
Thank you very much, you're all great.
Even cooking is a science and study.
Today, someone came to me and told me that I work in the business field, and he has some aerials and wants to invest in them.
But what we have between us has neither understanding nor knowledge nor study in economics nor even in commerce.
Such a unit
He believes he will succeed; I don't think he will waste his time and he will lose.
I heard, O Abu Nasser
I heard these two nightingales saying something.
This is the speech
This is yours, my son, a falcon. Mashallah, he's impressive.
Jofouh Mashallah عليه
Jufuh today
Long live, we're not talking about your son, Saqr.
We are talking about the rule
Your son is a falcon, Mashallah, and I have my eye on him; he is considered an exception.
You tell me to talk about the base.
We were amazed, my son Saqr built himself, he built himself independently.
He gave him a car once as a gift.
He sold it, invested the money, and on his own advice.
Mashallah, you both look great.
Oh, Bu Sar, we are talking about ordinary people.
And one of them became like that, and that's exactly what Abu Nasser did to him—he took him and put his hand on the shoulder.
Mashallah, he's a falcon with commercial talents.
Powerful economic tendencies
We need to ask who his father is.
It's forbidden, I swear, I am amazed.
Masha Allah

Please.
And upon you be peace. Hello, hello, Salem.
Hope everything is okay
By God, I don't know what to tell you, Ya Salem
Yes, that's right.
The story is true.
I tell you, the company sent a fax for the father.
And they told him, "That's it."
Our house is unbearable
As you can see
I tell you, as soon as I heard the news
He fell in the office and the fax was cut off.
And he has a favor upon him
Indeed, according to the saying, I taught him archery; when his strength grew, he shot at me.
What is the doctor doing now?
Pray for him, O Salem.
I am I am shocked

Nora, our beloved, two beautiful and simple stories

What am I supposed to do, O Abu Saleh?
But we delayed it; the reward is a week ago.
Yes, indeed.
God willing, everything will be fine. Goodbye.
It remains him
Are you sure?
And with it, details, and you do not know the great calamity.
What else?
It is the rent of the shop next to your shop.
Oh jealous one, oh hateful one
Before I knew that the market was open to everyone
I must introduce myself
Your heart must be open for your cousin.
I just want to ask you
Deny, flirt, make me laugh, and do it for me.
I want to do my job quietly.
You take a glue stick from my place and ruin it for me.
By God, yes, but they didn't say come here and sit down, so I sat in my throat near the wisdom tooth, you know.
This is envy, this is hatred, I swear, I swear, I am jealous of this, this hatred has exhausted me over it.
Are you guys serious?
Oh, you, Abu Saleh.
I swear to God, I will beat you up, you bastard, you.
I extended my hand just as you extended yours, and I was left with my meal.
Hey, guys
Guys, pray for the Prophet.
I didn't do anything, I swear, I swear.
A designer from the Philippines advised me.
No one will cut you off.
Why, I mean, why is it that a Lebanese is so stubborn?
He chats with him, flirts, jokes around, and they take their time to the fullest.
I see Bousaleh bringing a Lebanese.
He sat and kept convincing me.
I am enchanted, enchanted by his words
And he convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand rials.
And after two days, I swear to God, I will go to the auction market and find the cabin there, twin brothers, smiling, Ariel.
And I got the money
Bring a Lebanese designer
Can I meet the teacher yesterday? You told me the exam is also difficult.
Yes, indeed, today is also very difficult.
I feel like Abu Saleh has changed these days.
What is it?
No, I don't know what it is.
Abu Saleh is very mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and brought in a Lebanese designer like him.
I haven't been able to visit for two weeks due to the shop's sales.
What is this defect here in Ghatri? Ghatri didn't open a shop for me; unless Ghatri comes and invests in the same project and opens the same shop next to it. Can I enter?
Lalalala, he is with designer Fadi, hello, and they are thinking of a solution.
How come now?
We're just sitting here, eating poison.
If we continue like this, I think even the rent for the shop won't be covered.
A place far away from them, I mean
This means to clear the area for them.
Alright, thank you. And how much is the discount?
What do I say, God willing, you don't give with every wedding dress evening dresses at all
What do they say about my people?
What happened is that I went to the store where you guys are today, they posted an advertisement with every wedding dress, two evening dresses for free, and on top of that, a 25% discount.
Come on, let's go, let's go
No, hello, I've been waiting for two weeks. They will come back and sell the same dress. Make me a wedding dress and get two dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking like this too because tomorrow if we leave them, they'll ruin our house.
And don't worry about it
He then announced it
That is a challenge, and I thank him.
No challenge, kid.
Good for you, you did well. The worthless one doesn't want anyone else to prosper.
Oh, and I will let you know the news in two or three days if you don't settle his matter once and for all.
Well done!
Stay, stay, sugar, sugar, I am coming, coming to you now, coming, come on, peace
Good things happen
Saad says the place is unbearable, it smells bad, he says he doesn't know where it's coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner.
It smells so good I left the place at least six days ago.
Hundred percent
Come on, night.
Cut off the electricity wires to the shop
That is correct.
Are you going to sign the pledge now, or should I file a case and open a file?
Do you want me to do something for him?
His termination from existence
Hey Uncle Bin Nasser, something strange is happening; no one is entering the shop.
Uncle Abu Nasser, sugar, sugar, a customer is coming to me, I'll tell you again, it's strange.
Akuh and he's lying in his bed, drooping.
I told him about my mental state. Honestly, brother, I was afraid to tell him that the bank is calling and they want the installments.
He was overwhelmed with debts because of his cousin, that unlucky one.
Zain, what happened this time?
Therefore, if they accidentally entered the place and disturbed designer Saad, they should shout at him and chase him away.
Hey, this is Inam, and he is the one who brought the lamp, his eyes are wide open, and he is looking at the ceiling.
What should I do?
Saad F. Al-Mahal
I enchanted my mother, what should I do for her?
When I see it, women invent fears.
I don't know what to do.
He lost me, he lost me
Give me a lot, brother
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
I don't have any evidence against him to go and complain about him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did
Let him deserve it
And whoever surrenders you, tell him what kind of magic I did for him. I made the designer turn into a beast, and women, if they see him, get scared.
A rumor spread about him
Hey, guys, tell him the filming crew needs you urgently.
Guys, and whoever God grants you safety, tell him they need you urgently, urgently.
By God, they raise my blood pressure, they slaughter me, they paralyze me, it doesn't happen like this, Mr. Abdullah.
Ma'ali Ahmed Habibi, don't get upset like that. You're a heart person; this doesn't suit you, my dear.
I swear I called him. He hurt me so much, embarrassed me, but it was no use. This actor is going to drive me crazy, crazy.
You don't do anything; everything is on my head.
Inside the valley of 'Aad, ba ba, I will put the fire in you
His five and twenty sweets, sixteen scenes, oh God, Ahmed, we want to finish.
And then, I mean, I stop filming because the extras don't get it.
This production output
Well, I don't care, Mr. Abdullah. Why is he bothering me like this?
My love, do you want anyone to bother you?
What's up, Abdullah?
Late extras and pretenders
Oh Ahmed, I don't want anyone, my beloved.
Inside, I have a certain aura that convinces people that he can really be a millionaire, a billionaire, not just anyone.
Sir, please go to the photo department and your request will be ready within half an hour.
Not just anyone, يا علاء, not just anyone. I am still clarifying it to him.
Alright, I'm managing myself with two scenes after one scene.
So you bear the responsibility, and you, the production manager, bear the responsibility.
And sometimes they do it
They do everything underground, the director is annoyed, and it's all up to God, but they manage.
This requires someone with specific qualities; I will find him, don't worry.
You are serious, you.
I didn't hear what the director said.
I have one, may God help you with it, God willing it will be beneficial.
SS Saud Aknar
Saud Qawati, I am the one who informs him, Saud Aknar.
Oh, this was when he was little; they used to call him Aswad Aknar, and when he grew up, they named him Qawati.
Why bottles?
I'm telling you, that's why he's poor—he's wandering the streets, picking up cans and selling them by the kilo.
Oh my brother, Ghani and Wahiba are not a disappointment.
It seems it must fit him, here he is, the one I told you about, and he is very tall and broad.
It definitely works.
God willing, I just tell you to fix your makeup completely; it will work perfectly because he's easygoing.
All good, what are you waiting for? Speak up.
I don't have the number
But I will take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud Qouti's house
What does he say?
Be quiet, be quiet, you.
Saud Qawati
In our neighborhood, we have someone named Saud Qawati.
Ambela, I am sure he is in the neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This is a house of one person named Saud, he lives there with his mother only.
Yes, that's correct
But this is not Saud Qawati
This is Saud's laptop
Sure, he's just developing over time; the laptop is almost like a toy.
He is tall and sturdy, and a bit of a Hanthawi.
Tala'iya canceled the party and started suppressing the old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, man.
Going to the market to buy it for me, where is the other one?
Honestly, I don't know, Dad.
This is the one that is all about pretending.
I have another one, my mother. Where is the second headscarf?
The right of the individual
This is what I'm looking for, where is it?
Vex and Bofas
Dad, I will fry it a little before your mother takes it out.
It's just these past couple of days that have been tough on me.
Mother, God, what happened since yesterday? We are worried about you. I want to go to the emergency. I want to go to the emergency. And you tell me no.
Oh mother, they told me they will give me.
Praise be to Allah, this is it, Dad. You got the job instead of your unemployment sitting.
Come on, Mom, goodbye.
You calm down, get excited, act foolish, and go upstairs.
Sit down a little, move a little, and with you, the camera moves with you.
Yes, Jafar, yes
Whose laptop is this?
Hey Aboud, the real one, a great actor, Abdullah Al Lama.
This is with you, I have a son, Fat Aboud. How are you?
How are you, servant
Just calm down, I respect yourself a little in front of people.
Hey, kid from our neighborhood
Stop, stop, stop, stop, ahh, ahh
I love acting, God willing they give me the role of a prostitute.
By God, my brother, I didn't tell you.
I'm exhausted, I swear, I swear. I swear I didn't sleep yesterday, brother.
Asthma, God willing, heals.
May God heal her.
Falling in spring
Hey teacher, hey teacher
He has asthma, may God bless his mother.
Director, not a doctor
I'm leaning on you, listen to what he says, I swear you have no story.
What is this?
To hell with you, what do you think?
What do you say about yourself?
Are you telling me it's light? Make it a bit heavier, heavier.
Give me a gift, a gift, a gift, a gift, half a million to fix my car's engine.
And he gives him three million, he will bring me dinner.
Tony, I'm just asking you why you're acting like this.
Because I am heavy according to some people's requests
Jouf, oh teacher Gafil, our neighborhood's production has actors of a high level
Currently excellent, meaning they bring it in suitable for the role.
Sweet, I will also help you. I am a viewer, I don't have, I don't have, right?
This is your Sharina house
By God, I am falling for Rabi'
Take the teacher and bring him into the makeup room, do his makeup, and Salman, God willing, I will have him bring you the clothes and pick out for you.
Walk, walk, walk. Very nice.
AI AI
Listen, brother, leave the car with us. When we finish filming, I will call you to come and pick it up.
Don't worry, but is there anyone to pick me up?
I'll get you there, I'll leave it to you. Let us know. I'll get you there. Thank you, my brother. Well, thank you. Thank you. Wait a moment.
Come on, call your awake ones, this extra, call him. Come on.
Guys, call Saud, the laptop is in the makeup room.
Leave it be, man, clean your beard.
It is written in front of me
Let's say it, God willing
I'm done, I mean.
I didn't think it from you
We are silent about what.
We are silent about our rights
Oh, be patient
And I know who I am talking to, Abu Abdulaziz
Why did he divorce her, why?
Just divorce her, that's all.
And we don't take a thief's daughter
No, I don't need it. What do you think?
He'll add it later, but the important thing is you just shake yourself so you can go to the dressing room to change your clothes, and we're ready for the shoot.
My precious dental crown
Oh, this scene is too difficult to film.
So why?
I don't want the injection, man. We're bored, my stomach is bloated. What's this injection? We've been waiting for an hour. When are we going to be called?
Dad, B B B, after you, nothing has dried up. This is normal.
May God grant you health.
Fast, Mashallah
God bless you, may you live long. In God's protection.
Peace be upon the group
Their saying: Abu Abd al-Aziz sends his regards.
God willing, long live your age, God willing
Sweet things
Ashurak, Islamon asks you, do they still love your nose?
The first time anyone loved me on my nose
How do they love them on their noses
Problems
His nose received like an ice cream stick, cracked in your buttocks, sweet, sweet
Honestly, you didn't laugh after all.
Good for you
It means a good actor
Hopefully everything is fine, I heal your voice.
Dad, dad, I'm tired, I'll wait for you.
Come on, hurry up
Hello to the Sheikh, hello
Hey man, look here or look there yourself.
Listen to me, yeah
Yes, come on, let's go
The empty respect is increasing
It happens, Dad.
And peace be upon you. What is there, Your Honor?
Khalī khalī khalī khalī
And don't worry, God willing, it will be, Dr. Hassan. Come, come.
Yes, Dr. Hani, what's going on?
Let him rest in the office, sir.
I didn't find it.
Everyone, God willing, will get through safely.
Please, please, long life, please.
Shut up or I'll slap you in the face
My name is Bouabdellah.
Call me, say it, Uncle
How are you, Uncle?
By Allah, on this day
Yes, Your Majesty
Here you go, sir. Take a rest.
God bless you
With this code
Go with him, Professor Rashed
By God, if anyone has done anything to you, I have heard about it and will tell you about it.
Hey buddy, can I see a doctor quickly?
My mother is sick, doctor.
Wait your turn, your turn, your turn
Listen to me, yeah
Possible companion
Oh Dad, I'm feeling very tired.
Wow, with all your visits to the hospital, you take your mother every week. I haven't seen a single one of them, and they are good people who would be satisfied with at least something.
Not like the local girls
Let the local girls handle it.
Alright then, find yourself someone from the hospital.
Melancholic temperament
Come on, man, don't give me that.
Alright, go ahead and approach her, make her laugh, flirt with her, give her your number, and have good intentions.
There's nothing, nothing.
Respect yourself
Well, go on, go on, go on, talk to Security, I can talk, Mac.
Lala, I don't want anything.
Not السير لازم يسرب
I am a proud person
No, thank you
You can take it and go.
Whoever speaks to you is in trouble.
I marry him, I mean I marry him
No, I want the bisht, I want the clothes, and I also want to rent the car from you.
Because of you, sir, may your reward be with you
No, no, wait
Oh God
What is this? A shooting range in Al-Marzouz.
Hello and welcome, may God bless the one who came to us. Hello!
Oh refuge, yesterday I saw with my own eyes
But I wish you would come.
I tell you, they were amazed by what I did for them. It was a very elegant and special party.
Regular one and the other is diet
Malaj has an excuse now
What is this?
Mom, the guys' gathering is tomorrow at work.
God willing, you will take this to them.
What cures him?
Noura Ta'ali
What is this?
I swear this is for his friends, for the scandals.
Your attitude makes everyone talk about us.
Give me money and tomorrow I will go buy you something fancy.
Oh, I just promise them now.
And I have to take him tomorrow
It's okay, they're open now. Change my clothes so we can go get something to eat and enjoy ourselves in front of people.
May God heal you.
And its price is reasonable, and its quality is very good.
Above average means not the highest quality.
Even if there's chocolate for the doctor, I see. Sorry, I thought maybe you want the right price.
After this, his soul is precious. Why should we send him to the most expensive?
It can't be, check this artistic touch.
Haidi Esma, the royal chocolate
The same chocolate that the royal palace in Spain always orders
Give me this
Congratulations, and along with it, a warranty certificate as well.
Please, please, rejoice
Come on, brother, give us some of that chocolate, brother.
What is the occasion, O Lion?
No Saleh Abdulqader in the accounts
With blessing, he deserves it. Come after me. Give me one. Come.
Let's catch up with the coffee quickly.
My aunt, I went to their wedding.
Oh my love, I went to their wedding. May it fail, may it burn the heart. Can you believe it, my sister?
I heard what your aunt said.
That's why I want to marry you, whether it happens or not.
There’s nothing left for me except a month and a half.
I am organizing everything.
But just let me in already
You are not living in the community; you don't see the people who hold their weddings, they put their solutions and their permissible things.
And I saw your departure
When I bought you something nice, I saw how they praise you and praise your taste.
They didn't tell you it's wonderful and beautiful.
Yes, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the café is enough to buy four sheep for the wedding.
And the one who hands you over, you don't interfere. Your mother knows how to do everything. It's your job to give her the money, and that's it.
It means they also agree with anything we choose.
Wow, you really have no taste.
What do you think of the halkousha?
But discrimination costs more money.
Zain, why, why was what was gone beautiful?
What do you think about this?
For the first time in Qatar's history, someone is thinking of making a computer-shaped wedding arch.
Excuse me, just a moment.
Look, they talk about everything except the wedding canopy and the preparations. This is the place where the women who have nothing but the Hajj sit. Just be quiet.
The Riyal is waiting for us
We want this luxurious wedding arch.
Strange corner
Guess the model in 2011
That's it, we took the car.
Relax, all of this is for your own good.
The important thing is to choose whether Noah's Ark will be increased by twenty thousand, or if the horse is one hundred twenty-five thousand.
We are ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
Think twice before getting married in the Comoros; this is the country's way.
No, we're just at the beginning still.
If you don't want a canopy, then where will the bride sit in the morning?
Iron, paint, and some wood roasting
And the people are happy
They exploit us and deceive us, these scammers are just like that.
And you, what do you mean now?
Amtnqir and upset
I don't want to get married anymore.
I am talking to the bride's mother and telling her that Saleh is going through difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married; he can't afford the wedding expenses. It's okay if you want me to talk to her; I swear I'll talk to her.
We received a bouquet of roses from the Netherlands today.
In my opinion, if I put them on the tables at the wedding
Definitely for the first time in Doha
And the Middle East afterwards
Put it on the bill
It means "more and more."
Seventy-two, that's it.
But hey Samir, I don't want to see this lineup at a wedding among weddings.
Do you know after the people's talk?
Alright, consider it booked.
But you earn more than me.
A door opens for you that you don't know how to close.
God help you, Salih
But come on, may God guide you, I tried to organize things a bit.
But thank God, I decided to go see a good girl from any Arab country.
I'll tell you, there's a wedding party that costs you only two thousand dollars, and jump.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
Just specify how many cards and tell me.
The cards are just for show, that's all. The important thing is that people know where they are invited and at what time, that's it.
This is just what matters to you, not what people will say.
People, do they know the level of the wedding from the invitations?
Hey, tomorrow I will give these cards; I want to know what people are saying.
They leaned on their wedding; as long as these are their invitations, they haven't seen the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say it like that; we are going to order it from the internet.
Its cover is made of fabric from panda fur and has coarse Zari J.
It's not your fault, but I don't blame you.
I don't become a eunuch, so I go to the women, the cards, we ask for them, I mean, we ask for them.
By God, you're breaking my heart, brother.
Poor guy, they must be pressuring him.
Oh Riyal, no one was allowed to borrow from him.
What do you say, he even sold his car.
His face looked twenty years older in the morning; I saw him walking and talking to himself.
I don't blame him, my poor brother, honestly I don't know when we will develop.
Please, close the door gently.
Forgiveness, my brother
So you didn't try to convince them to have a modest wedding.
It means "roughly" or "to my extent."
Why am I living for myself
The problem is that our society is obsessed with appearances, boasting, and arrogance.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live in it
Once I caught a glimpse of the bride's mother.
I only want my clothes
Leave it to God
Except my words
How did you get married?
And I don't want to marry Minoon.
And then, my brother, even if I decide to get married
I'm thinking of taking a foreign or even an Arab one.
Yes, by God, your country is amazing.
By God, we had decided to bring a DJ for the songs.
But since Mother Nasser insists on her son's wedding, that singer
This singer is famous, but I forgot his name.
Ashfeej, the substance of the bomb
Jenna, I don't like what you're doing.
Akfaia sold his car, and every day one of his friends takes him there.
I entered the room to help him and found him talking to himself.
I see your words are changing now
Because my brother Saleh is tired, that's it.
I don't care about you or him.
I am no less than others
Don't leave us, we're having a picnic.
And whoever surrenders to you, mother, my brother spent all he had and didn't leave anyone he didn't borrow from.
And whoever surrenders to you, just be silent.
My mom has new requests for the wedding, and my brother told her to cancel the wedding; I no longer want to get married.
Where is she now?
Inside Isoun, there are first aid supplies
I say now, but they will just find her a room in the hospital.
My eyelids are scandalous
Relax, girl.
The doctor told you not to speak and gave you an injection so you wouldn't sleep.
Where do I rest when he's making us a picnic for those who are worth it and those who aren't
So I tell him to bring us Abdullah Arweeshad, he says I don't have any money.
And on your mother
He was afraid for her
Give her a soul, give her a soul, and kiss her on her head
And tell her I'll do whatever you want.
Beyeb Lij Abdullah Arweishid
Boo Youssef, I think he won't disappoint me.
Shame on you, I only found Bousaif.
Heal her, please.
Yenit, you are صالح
But the minister is careless because he is a thief, and above all, everything is organized and trustworthy.
You want my opinion, Dad? If you went and told him what you told me, there's a high chance his heart would stop.
I understand
Because of the terrible crisis you're going through, you want to ask Bouyousif for money, of course from the ministry's funds.
God knows, when will you return them to him
Hey, if the audit team didn't come to him, ask him about the money.
He could definitely go to hell.
No one knows later; he knows how to handle himself.
By God, how are you, man, in the office, and you bear the responsibility if something happens.
The last of my life, I steal.
My uncle says we call it embezzlement.
On the first step
In my bottle, I have a white strip of blue, and inside there's a circle with something like what you say, like the picture, the dove, yeb yeb.
God willing, my uncle, my uncle Bouyousif, I, I, if I don't hurt myself, it's difficult.
All of his return
Ismouni Bouyoussef
Come, you are the end of my life
You ruin me, O Khamis
Saleh Saleh
Hassan, listen to what I'm saying. I swear, if it were anyone else besides you, they would be beaten or something would happen to them. Oh, oh, oh, Khaled.
Saleh Saleh
All the ways I tried were useless, Uncle Boulos, I'm completely overwhelmed now.
I can't back out now from the wedding.
And these, I know all of them, are bald.
I heal you, I heal you
Lala, the beauty, the second beauty.
In the stairs, in the stairs
My uncle Bouyousif, the stairs are full, sweetheart, any one of them.
The Gothic Alalala with a Real picture on it looks terrifying.
We booked two rooms just for makeup and hair.
And tomorrow morning we will be there.
Yebna Abdullah Arweeshad and his band
You see, my love
I didn't tell him, did I?
Bomb of the season
We are the first people to use it in the world.
Oh mother, oh mother
Goodbye, take care
There is no god but Allah
Mom, don't forget that tomorrow, when you enter the hall, recite the Mu'awwidhat.
The women here have hot eyes.
I told you it's amazing
The sweetest groom, Mashallah, you're amazing, my eye, you're cool.
Mom, mom, the police are knocking on the door.
I am wrong for obeying you, oh God
My marriage is forbidden today
Ah, the audit fee.
Come on, open the prison for him.
Boo Youssef Boo Youssef Boo Youssef
So the people
But it's a shame, my brother, if this thing happens
The company submitted a contract worth three million, two million of which is just the value of the materials.
Wrote a memo for the minister
We said corruption, but it has not reached the extent of corruption to the point of waste.
You seem like you're not really living in this world.
Hey, human, Minister, I have fulfilled Othman's right.
And our director, why didn't he need to say he had it?
I don't know about him, I swear I don't know
Where are the morals?
The wrong became right, and the right became wrong
Oh Saad, are you sure the minister is finished? Guys, what's happening in the world?
Fensha and nothing else
What else?
The king owns the minister's brother
And this girl is involved with the minister.
God, oh world
I wonder if you didn't recognize this one.
This new employee whom the minister appointed in place of poor Othman.
Walk, walk, walk
What do you want me to do, Saalih? Should I confront the minister?
Who are you
Listen to me, Dad
We have children we want to raise.
I want to live
What happened?
There is a poor man standing by the turn.
His end is sincerity and honesty, my brother Saleh.
John, Zain, we can't do anything for you, brother.
Praise be to Allah, praise be to Allah in all circumstances
How are you, Saleh?
From these strange things that we see in this world, we are tired.
Now there are things that the mind cannot believe
My country
I want you to stop by the supermarket to buy us some bread, and when you leave work.
Trying, goodbye.
Who is the one who brought my sister home?
And he's sitting in front, laughing and chatting, who is this?
This is my colleague with me at university. If I get there, it's okay, I mean.
We, we, we, I don't believe it. What's wrong with you? You're just like before.
What do you all say?
You don't hear us, what do we say?
Your thinking is outdated
Right and wrong still have new and old.
Right is right and wrong is wrong
The world has evolved; we are living in the age of technology.
The era of global changes where the world is uniting and no one can keep up.
We truly lived and we truly endured.
Don't blame me, O Amnira, it's not my fault if I get annoyed and angry.
Of what he sees in his day
Tell her I'm sorry
The world is no longer going well.
Come on, don't bother yourself and come have lunch.
Let me go and lie down to rest
Dad, I'm not upset with you.
Dad, there's no sedan.
No, don't be upset. Get up, wash yourself, and eat tomorrow.
Come on, my love
Of course, I am very eager to meet Abkam on my first day of work.
It is our honor, Your Majesty.
Definitely, definitely
Of course, I know that you don't need me to remind you of the work principles.
But at the same time, very important
We recover with some of the values and principles that have been lost.
In the public interest
It is supposed to be, Your Majesty
We all need to
The necessary thing, Your Honor.
Are you all thieves?
Thank you, thank you all.
And what I want to say after that
And I warn you from my first day of work.
There is only one employee between you
Trustworthy, sincere, dedicated, and in these professional matters.
Just a doubt
There is a trustworthy employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal measures against him in our ministry
I won't disappoint you, Your Honor.
Thank God, we're all thieves.
Rest assured, Your Honor, my colleagues are in front of them and behind them, I say.
Where is Khaled
Yes, Your Majesty
Khaled, I praise you so much, so much, MashaAllah on you
God willing, long live your age
By God, long-lived one, I knew you could choose.
God, guide you, that's all.
Why do you let the devil deceive you?
Say الحمدلله that you came honestly.
Mom, why is my father in prison?
My train, oh mother
Lala Toba
Mom, why is my father in prison?
Our nakedness is our head
It means he became trustworthy.
It's a shame to say about Abu Ameen
This is a dress
Every body is covered
Shijofon the world
God willing, I will look for a job for you so that someone will work for you like this.
A decent girl covers her body and her charms.
Cover my chest after I wear this tight one forever.
I begged her, mother.
No, and then she comes back for it after I started with the pants that reveal half her belly above the secret.
But there's no use; you don't listen to the words, you don't want to walk the right path.
I am telling you this
I only blame myself.
We are proposing to your daughter Sarah for our son Rashed.
One of us, honestly, only a decent man would build for his daughter these days.
And Rashid, I have good news for you
You are very handsome
The hero descended from his hall.
Twenty-four hours drunk
Drunk and tired, sniffing all day long
And the mischief, no, don't ask about it
Yes, indeed, a good upbringing, Abu Rashed.
And I give you good news after hypocrisy
And how about the horn
Noble, my dear, and drugs, how are they?
The written is finished. I will give you five riyals if you find his black eye; it's a contest about it.
Come on, Abu Sara, we haven't come to propose to her.
He is just making noise and acting foolishly.
Girl of origin
With God's blessing, my children, with God's blessing, this is the year of life, with God's blessing.
I am drunk
And I can't walk
Oh, God, Dad
Yalla bye bye
Come on, come on, call your dad so he can come and pick you up.
Call him, why?
Come so I can take you.
Where is he
Is there a guy sitting and talking loudly with a beautiful blonde girl?
Do you believe your father is walking with a lady giving her?
Hello my daughter, my dear Mona
Majid was not his name, Abdulaziz
Oh justice
My daughter, Doodetini
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 1990 after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and blockade against it.
Most recently, the claims made by Israelis and their Arab allies against the Palestinians
That they smuggle plastic knives through tunnels
Especially the second clause, paragraph F, which states that the Palestinian people trim their nails every day.
We now move with you to the decisive meeting.
My cheap sir
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
Hey man, what are you saying? Hey man, you're ruining our reputation with your actions, and leave the other one alone.
Please
Sorry, Sir Tiger. Sorry, Mr. President.
Allow me with the word
I fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this Israeli delegate talking about?
We have nothing solid like stone or plastic, out of our commitment.
Even our houses, man
What do you call yourselves, the Gulf people?
Throughout Palestine, everything is made of wood
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
All the doors of our houses are made of heat-treated wood, man.
We do not want speeches
Don't change the subject
Mr. President
This point is important; I request a vote on this matter because nail grooming is a violation of the agreement.
The one who agrees raises his hand
I just had a strange dream
To control the students
I was telling him
This is the fourth school I will be attending tomorrow.
Because I have portrayed my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning
The boys are chasing him and tearing his clothes, and he remains silent.
Once, I came without a head covering.
Their manager told me
Rashid, okay, we don't want to dismiss him.
They are drawing on the ground with chalk.
He wore his cloak in the open in front of the whole world
And they said this is a teacher with a shaky personality, may he ruin us all.
I tell them the story of the catab.
Maryam returned
And what is this story about the cat? This is new; no one told me.
Write her a shot that brings her completely onto the chair.
He sat down
And he did not know about the incident
The day the children laugh at him in the schoolyard.
Bask 'ad
Tell your manager who starts work there tomorrow to call me.
But it's okay, I'll give him a chance later.
Because I want to tell you
The era of kindness and weakness has ended.
Oh, your cousin, Abdullah
I will meet Rashid differently
And I don't need to remind you of the important educational saying
You are a Education graduate, and I am an Education graduate.
And we all know the saying.
The teacher is the son of the first lesson
You will meet Professor Rashid Al-Qawi.
And the one who makes a mistake
Oh, woe to him
As soon as you started talking, he told you to be quiet. Well, what do you want to say?
I am about to say something.
Who among you is joking around and told someone to shut up properly?
You're the one who told me to be quiet, so I did.
No, I am not.
Oh, the one who hurt you.
Go, the soul of the right of the director
And his statement: Teacher Rashid expelled me.
I don't want to leave a piece here with you, I'm listening.
Outbursts in my irritation
It’s not just the first day like this, all year round.
Oh, woe to him
The one whose voice I hear
And I am explaining or not speaking
Do you know what it means?
Nervous, do you know what nervous means?
It means nervous.
Did you hear me or not?
I also heard it.
Move closer to the row
The soul of the right manager
Come on, take your things and leave.
Take your trash
Come on, that's good
Sure, I still have it.
No, professor, we didn't see it.
I love ice cream with milk, especially if it has strawberries inside. It's very delicious.
My beloved Abdulrahman
Indeed, every human is prone to error and son of Adam.
Ghashmara, father
It just means that the most important thing is the subject, so it doesn't reach the father.
I want the cocoa in my bag.
Okay, what's wrong? I insulted you, I insulted your homeland, and where is your bag?
The class
From my eyes
You say he's happy with you.
You don't know how to tell the difference between a noble boy and an ordinary one.
What does the tick look like? The tick is red and dangerous.
Come on, where are you going
In the bathroom
And you still in the bathroom
Knock on the door quickly and tell him the first session started half an hour ago. Come on, hurry up.
I am before all of them, one juice and one plaster.
I took almost all of them because of their poverty, my friend Abdulrahman. This is very good for health.
Alright, now go to Saud and get a PlayStation game from him.
So, what do we learn from this story?
Indeed, man
He must possess noble morals.
This is the PlayStation's money, and he told me he'll return all the PlayStation at once.
God willing, Tamer will do something after my friend Abdulrahman, my friend.
Not now
We learn from the story
Of course, you know that I am leaving this week because I received approval for graduate studies.
I said I need to submit the event file before I travel.
How do I get to the العصر (Afternoon) Abdulrahman told me I don't know where he wants to go but he didn't specify the time, what time?
My mother keeps saying that my father is traveling and hasn't said anything, thank God I managed to get rid of it.
Maybe I took him today in the afternoon and he got upset and didn't tell his father no no trouble but but no no
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman
God help you
What should we do?
Sweet, sweet like this
Oh, children, today we are going to learn a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you
Thank you, thank you
My father is water
I didn't ask for what I asked for from my eyes
Teacher, teacher, how do you ask the teacher Mie?
There is a teacher walking to bring water for a student. You are his bed. No, no, this matter will not pass peacefully; I will write it in the report.
You're still joking, you're still mocking.
Don't raise your voice or yell at me, or else I won't listen.
How much is this worth?
This is all the car's volume.
Four cars five
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent
What did you do here?
Just like you, Jaeif, is going to park cars in front of our houses at our expense.
Don't tell me about the days of Bounaser
Bonaser Khalas
He studies abroad
Zain broke the table.
About the nervousness, brother
Why, I wonder?
You're on top of a feather
Adjust your manner with me.
Me and you
We didn't say anything, Dad.
What is this?
Listen, let things go smoothly; it's much better for you.
We are not afraid, Dad.
There's no need, I just want to make things easier for you.
Are you joking?
Instead of, what is it called, I mean
You look like you want it.
You want this, how you want it, fine.
Faster, faster
Haha, that's good like this
It depends on him; it won't happen.
Abu's neighborhood
We are coming to Uncle Bounaif's place to remember, not to shout.
Who's this Rashid, acting in the neighborhood however he pleases?
You made me talk
Alright, guys, let's be quiet so we can hear what Uncle Bounaif is saying.
Now this worthless guy who isn't worth a penny is playing with your nerves.
Khalwa Ali
If I didn't give him a slap, I would have stuck him to the umbrella he made yesterday.
The game is played by its people.
That's good.
With farewell
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store.
Joufa is wearing those rings and chains
Khalf Allah علينا
Just walk straight ahead in the heat.
Rashid couldn't believe it; he was naive and had nothing, and this is what happened.
He appointed him Deputy Director General of the Global Educational Center
He says to you, he teaches you, you are a teacher and he is a teacher, but where is he now and where have you reached?
Shame on you
Oh, you’re amazing, Abdullah
I'll teach you what the secret is
The teacher has arrived, the teacher has arrived
Professor, I didn't do anything.
Professor, you don't know this boy from
Oh my love, I know this is a boy from
Hey, I'm telling you, we don't get a good opportunity like this often.
I'm looking for a job. You made me laugh, I swear, you made me laugh.
No, Dad, the job is in the pocket.
Thank you, you haven't fallen short. Thank you, thank you.
Greet him
IK, I send my regards to your mother after God blesses you. May God bless you, and I hope I will greet you.
Oh, goodbye my love, in God's safety
After I ask about your brother and he becomes a minister, I swear, Dad.
Alright, Mom, we will work, we will work hard.
But my father, if your work, they don't say anything.
That's just how I gave it to you.
Oh, just forget it, it's nothing.
Normal automatically, I don't want to talk.
Come on, my dear, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream is mine
Arrange for me a tower among the Corniche towers
Come on, wait a moment
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Go for it, Abu Saleh
I say, your friend looks upset.
I swear, I don't see it in him, man.
You can do it, Bousaleh.
I swear, I won, took the phone, and gave it to Bousaleh.
Look at these moves, and Sultan is definitely 100% proud of him.
He didn't really have a good relationship with Bou Saleh.
Laa Bousultan, no one does this unless they have something planned.
Is it really that much?
He returned to close the car door.
In the end, he works until the car doors of the minister stop functioning.
Oh, Dad, don't hurt my heart, don't hurt my heart
For your knowledge, the story we hear in the cafes is happening in the town.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing.
My heart is stopping, my heart is stopping
I'm afraid, Mom, that the story will fall into the women's laps, or that I won't pass the dishwashing anymore, Mom. You embarrassed me in front of the women.
Say something, Bousultan, talk to me, I'm shocked during the day
Please, I know what I should do.
He has no right.
Amnira, I am working calmly.
Since I opened the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan I have in mind.
I should be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plan
I let them take it away
What plan
He just needs to trust me in the beginning.
They told me his eyes are like a minister's because he was appointed two months before you.
Because I guaranteed it, I took it and carried it.
Magic can be broken
What is this?
What is this after?
And every activity that photographers prohibit, keep taking pictures until your photo gets burned in the newspaper.
And his scent rises until it floats to the surface
Sure, of course
You stay patient, let me work on it and improve it.
On the contrary, long life.
Of course, Your Excellency the Minister
Then come and tell me
I thanked him for the lamb; it's really good meat.
The king is at the door, stand up for him
I don't want to be a burden; people want to take advantage of me, and you want to belittle yourself.
Minister, please go ahead, please go ahead
No, no, I can't imagine myself. No, the minister's effort, but a picture, a picture of the minister's effort.
He hits him in the second second.
By God, brother, I really liked this plan of yours.
I want you to take him there
Picture picture picture
Any minister needed
Alright, I'll tell you in a moment.
My soul, the penultimate page
My friend took his picture and showed it to the groom.
Say: There is no god but Allah
Every day has one or two pictures.
As your social activist friend says, Yalla Yalla, goodbye
They all love you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
Nails in every wall
These two are envious and jealous of you; only the fruitful tree is thrown with stones.
People and I went to the market
I'm not ready yet
Peace be upon you
Hello, peace be upon you. Hello.
You are very well known
Hey, Sisma Abdulhadiis Abdullah, hey
This is my husband
I am just talking to Mom.
three hundred fifty
Asan is a well-known person
I'm at home today, hopefully everything is fine.
Honestly, let me have a headache today, my head is pounding, my body is exhausted, and I have a colon attack.
I'm really tired, honestly tired. I've been searching for a month, and I'm still looking.
Let me rest today
Hello, Umm Sultan
What do I say
Oh, my dear, just let me get there.
I see you are transferred.
Did you see what the famous violet is doing?
I know, thank God, that you are convinced.
Honestly, it turns out
Your minister seems complacent; he liked the previous matter.
I will keep quiet for you, my brother Saad
No, I swear I didn't follow any activity today nor did I read the newspapers, I don't know.
Sure, God be with you, goodbye
God is the one who will make the ant's disappearance happen, giving it wings.
Hello brother, do you have the conference at the hotel tonight?
Wedding
So, basically, there's no activity like that—no party, birthday, or wedding.
I don't know, but maybe you can see the hotel behind us.
Oh, there's a hotel behind you.
I'll leave you in the car and go into the hotel, ask.
Go, go, go, take your rest, go ask, go
May everyone be successful, God willing.
Let this minister let us sleep and rest
He didn't find any party, wedding, or any reason to celebrate.
Fourteen thousand hotels and he couldn't find anything, his luck is as bad as his face.
My track, only mine
I couldn't find him a birthday or anything.
The truth is, I might catch the second round.
Every number has a hundred images.
He who doesn't sleep, doesn't wake up, my brother.
Hey man, this is the string cutter. This is the first thing, shake his picture, and then make the string.
Are you saying my children are having a contest over a picture of the Minister of Railways?
One person asks the other, and he says to him, "What time is the picture of the minister in the newspaper today?"
And the one who wins, they give him a prize
It's not like that, the story is you come to the coffee shop and listen to the comments every day about the photos in the newspaper. He tells you, Haji, he never stops.
God is close to his demise
That's it, as they say, the butterflies, until God wills their disappearance, I got close to the light.
People greet you and say hello to you.
He became one of the most famous celebrities in the country.
Woe to you, and who is this?
My ruin, my prestige
May Allah keep you safe and grant you peace
Are you saying that we all got married except for poor Amal, the only one among us who didn't get married?
This share
It is not written for me to promote.
And I'm done with the marriage issue.
God is sufficient for me against whoever was the cause
Who are these water carriers sitting over there?
What heals them
The one who plays with his hair.
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, and I mean I slaughtered him.
Oh, may your eyelids grow thick.
It's forbidden for you to be attached to the maid.
Come on, my soul, get ready to go
I was talking to my mother, but not only that, she has a servant for him, she has two for him.
We told her a hundred times, don't interfere with Khalood; he's my son, not yours.
You have no other story except Khulood and the maids, except the maids and Khulood.
Mom, it's not good like this. Khalood, twenty-four hours with the maid, and she doesn't want anyone else.
Come on, go outside. Let me rest. I want to sleep. How am I?
My father Saud, Khulood, your brother has become a builder.
Wait a little if you haven't told my father about you.
No, I tell you, Khulood, I heal Khulood.
Saud says that Khulood puts on makeup and makes herself look like a girl, what a story, what a story.
Bl Bl Bl on you, Saud
He puts makeup on his face, Khulood, but the makeup is old. Oh people, look at the makeup box and play with it.
I saw this big event, and I didn't even realize.
Nice, sweet, and gentle
I am Saud's wife
I haven't seen you in a long time
Hey Saad, that time I asked you what you want to become when you grow up, and you didn't answer me. Now answer me, what do you want to become when you grow up?
And you, Khuludi, my love, Saad will become an officer. What are you going to become?
We go to London the same year.
Any word trembling in Bahrain
His saying: "Let him bring Sawsan and Fahoud and Khulood."
And send my regards to Samoura
I seek forgiveness from Allah the Almighty
Today my dad told me to choose
Do you want me to build you a land by the sea or the land we took?
Tell him I don't want to choose.
My love, I live with you anywhere.
Thank you, my love
And teach me how to catch a fool
Oh God, hope, I want to close my eyes and open them, and they tell me hope, I finished university.
AF Jannah Men's Perfume
My mother, but it smells very strange.
He and heals me
The way you talk has become feminine.
You forgot that you're a real one
And God willing, after this, I will talk to the people outside.
I can't believe it, Khaled
Please, leave my room.
Oh, what a pity, Khulood
You fell from my eyes
Come on, don't hurt my feelings. I swear I'm going to tell my mother.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Therefore, you, Khulood, my eye's gaze, I wish all the children had your brightness and feelings.
And you, I hope I don't see anyone gentle and calm, you say about my daughters.
Shame, shame, to say such a thing about your brother.
But come on, you made the story bigger than it is, it's a small matter.
Put a little perfume with a nice scent on it; now, what's the difference between men's and women's perfumes?
Are you and I the ones who are going to talk about this in front of Dad?
I have
I'm just telling you to be quiet so that Mohammed doesn't feel anything.
Oh, where are these girls gathering?
By God, it's a shame to do this; she's a beautiful girl.
Don't look at him, don't look at him
I swear, I'm afraid he feels there's something bothering him.
Give yourselves a break
I know you're checking out the Bluetooth that’s popular these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, but let him come.
How are you, Saad
May God keep you safe
I'm telling you, we're waiting for you; we haven't played the paper yet.
Why?
You drink something
He is lying here with you in the apartment; he's been there for two days.
About the Bluetooth story
Oh brother, I am sworn to him with the oud.
Afraid of him
Don't try to kill me anymore, don't try.
Seek refuge from Satan, Mom, for my sake.
I have already booked.
I'm finally happy wherever I go, I don't care about people.
What do I tell your father?
Tell him anything
Oh, these kids, oh, them, oh
This is how it ends, Mom.
I remember when Khulood was little
This must be the result.
It's forbidden for you, but just get up and go outside.
The truth always hurts.
The jar broke
I can't possibly live in Doha
I have money
I haven't used my phone for a while.
And I rely on you, O Amal
And you, my daughter, spend your whole day in vain.
Plumb line, and I am a real one who spends the whole day meeting people outside.
It's hard, O Amal
I can't live my whole day and my entire life with my head buried in the ground.
My dad has been feeling for a while that something is happening at home and that there is a change.
But until when will my father be absent from the events happening at home?
Sometimes I blame my father, and sometimes I don't.
I know, O Amal, when I remember his hardship and dedication to his work so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him
When he left his responsibilities at home and with the children to the mother
We don't want to dig into the past now.
My father knew, yes or no
But I am just planning
Transfer the Bluetooth to him
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see my father's disappointment in my eyes
It hurts a lot
No matter what, O Amal
He knows about us.
Better than what is known through others
The damage to our house has reached such a level
Because a dirty bomb called Khulood exploded in him
and customs and traditions
Teaching them with all impudence
They closed their ears to her.
And they do not hear it.
Only one voice.
It is the sound of filth and perversion.
Vaidouson, all the good.
What came to your mind
Suddenly, I decided to travel for studies.
All I can say is, May God bless you, my son.
God bless you
The gift is the one brought by those coming back from a trip, not the travelers from yesterday.
You're right.
This is the rule
But for every rule
Amal, my nation, come with me, I will take you quickly
Oh mother, I'm thirsty
He didn't hear a thing
Bousaad
Bousaad
Bousaad, I heal you
Dad, what's wrong with you, dad?
Dad
Don't be upset
You are a great person
Wow, young man, wishes for a wife for himself
I never divorced you because of a flaw in you.
I divorced you
Because it's impossible
Accept that I am the uncle of my children
A weird one like your brother
Ha Solah
I feel empty every day.
First, you all don't understand anything.
Under the ground
That one is under the ground.
By God, that's strong words; you are capable of such words.
You will be in Wadi Al Watain, two hundred and two hundred, I swear, a lot of money.
Say Mashallah
Come on, let's go, come on
It's been seven months since you took the henna, my liver hurts. Please, take me home.
Failure and disgrace
This drug is bothering you.
Seven months have passed.
My pain, your pain
Travel it and get rid of it
Travel it and bring something else
Fahmi Waldaj doesn't know what this word means; he doesn't realize he's losing money over time.
Driver training, travel, and get rid of it.
Today is the first day I come to the Treasury; I congratulated myself six months ago.
Zain, then I say words and new promises, you.
This is oil in Ahin and Ahd Meah Arbatash Riyal per FAL, 1.5 Riyal per kilo. It's five Riyal, very expensive, Baba.
Alright, you're just a fool. Listen, what do I say?
You're coming for the first time. I am here to give you what you need.
Seventy gives
You are very new, only six months old, this is eight months.
I want money
This driver, you're doing old stuff, you're new.
This is seven hundred and eighty.
Ruh
This is just saying that he will come and give me only a hundred riyals.
Three hundred is useless
I am very good at talking.
Lala Shashi, no problem, I have plenty of time, I am in Yashard.
No fear, Shashi
He narrates from a sponsor who owns money.
Why are you cold?
This is a group of people, the first one is responsible for the money.
I don't know how much I know, six hundred, seven hundred, I don't know how much I have.
How are you?
Wool is not you, Cov
There is no COVID
God is sufficient for me against him
I sat down to film, then I went inside.
There is no one
Even the phone I bought for him has a package.
I did it
I did it too
They didn't fall short; take his passport and keep it with them.
Easy, Haji, you are very cheap.
Bandroora everywhere
Here's the problem, here's the problem
After all, what do they care?
They exhaust us and tire us out
I told you to travel him.
But don't worry, I think I'll leave it.
He is wherever he goes.
It means to go out or to leave.
I prefer to pay for his ticket and send him off, rather than have him stay in the country with no money.
My dear, I wish I could catch him.
Friend, come inside quickly, there's no one buying right now.
At the beginning of the match, it seemed like you were very afraid; I noticed it on you.
But we're just afraid of what? We're afraid that our team won't score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you are terrified, afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team; I'm afraid of our team. I'm worried I won't score. I'll tell you more than three.
This is the level of our team; I know it. I am talking about the level of our team.
Very great trust in you
That opposing team has nothing.
The foxes are cute, say now, you have advanced with the first goal.
Where did you go?
Roh Bet
In a car
Come, I will go with you, I will accompany you.
Oh, my gratitude, my friend
Why do you keep trying? Our team won't be defeated.
Your Highness, the matches have just started; the league has just begun.
You didn't hear what he said.
I'll tell you, it's a lot of trouble
Yallah Mahmud, bring the place.
Easy, my friend, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go
Come on, man, get in.
Here you go, sir.
What is he doing to himself?
Ah, the Indian guy
Yes, man, this is a ball game.
There is no saying, this is the talk of no team, no, I am a fox.
Sui Laboko Laboko
Come on, O prostrator, come on, O prostrator, hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up, bring someone with water, today the foxes are playing, hurry up
Dear viewers, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes team, nicknamed Thaloub.
But they just say that you beat them because they are lacking.
This is in talk, this is in talk, there's no good.
What's missing here? This is a team, very much a team, with about a dozen people.
And the guide is minus two, there's no benefit, same same
This is a devil fox
This is the best fan we have.
Well, on the occasion of this victory, Thaloub, I have a final word to address to the foxes.
All talk, standing still
When we fled, this was said by Thaalib.
This is inside a high sky.
This is the fair supporter
Look, my brother
He finds him so enthusiastic.
Here you go, handsome
So, where is the Indian boy who kicks the ball?
I haven't seen her for a while.
Hey man, this is a big problem, I can't stay here anymore.
The love I saw a few days ago, I didn't recognize him. He was sitting at a coffee shop called Starbox, something like that.
I remember that guy used to sit with us in the alley; he didn't have a teapot with him.
This is a real deal, the boy is twenty riyals, Bashish.
Wow, what he did like that
Hey man, he's counting with the club's senior officials, they're organizing him, I mean, they don't argue with him.
I say Thaloub
My mother's name
My mother says do it in my way, do it in my style.
You have no right to criticize a lousy and tired club like this one.
This is this team of foxes, the heart of Mali, I am.
When will you stop breaking my heart?
Good inside, there is a hole in it
You, Your Honor, have you ever heard the poem written by F. Al-Hakam?
The day our match with them took place
Please, please, Thaloub, say, say this is a poem, say, say.
My mother, oh God, in a world of secrets, I am wealth.
This is my money, I am very upset.
I don't sleep much at night.
You know that we are fans of the Foxes club.
So you can't tell me the name of the winner so I can scoop the journalist.
We have a press conference and, God willing, we will announce the name of the winner.
Say what his beauty
And the famous Thaloub, this supporter who was honored today by the management of the Foxes Club in a generous gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
By God
Thaloub, congratulations on this beautiful honor and certainly a wonderful gift.
Sano, I say, is this in a pen or in a bag?
By God, he is my father
This is a gesture
I tell you, it is him.
I need to inform the police
Sit in your place, I will wait.
Fans, all of this is in the fan's money
No, no, Dad, it's not that one, which one does he resemble?
I tell you, it is him.
You are late.
I don't know when the matches are or their times, man.
Alright, so how are we going to catch him now?
We just have to wait for the foxes' team to see when they will play the next match.
Yes, yes, I agree
Zain, let's catch up with him.
Dude, you're late.
Yes yes yes yes
Hit him, give him his due, hit him, follow him up
The thing is, we're not sure if this is it now or not.
I'm telling you, it's him, Dad, it's him.
I say the opinion and wisdom that we should go to those two people and ask them. I say, where does this money you have come from? How did it come to you? When did it come to you?
Dad, you need to make two trips out of this trip.
I'm going to inform him; I'm sure he is.
And the earth, may God bless you. May God honor you. My money is sleeping.
Registered under my name, named after me
This wind is in the second land next to his.
Say, I swear your father will give you a son, Abdalrahman, from Al-Sabji. No safety, no safety, no safety.
Lala Allah bless you, it seems we are wrong, my father. We are here for a friend, a companion, and we are like you.
God, His Majesty, created and guided a person, and he is like forty people.
Thank you, may you be safe, long life, appreciated
Lala, may God bless you. Forgiveness, forgiveness. Thank you, thank you.
Come on, forgive us for your arrogance. I am not your property. Forgive us, may God bless your generosity. Come on, may there be safety.
And you tell me afterwards that you're sure, huh?
What is my father doing to us now? May God protect us.
What did you do, O boy?
And I, as I walk, the bag is on my shoulder.
Yalla, ignite the anger of 'Aad.
Get up, your soul, get up.
God forbid, that's all.
God protect us
Come on, now understand your father with this talk.
Before my father realizes
A million pieces shattered
Alright, Mom, let's go buy one just like it quickly.
Before my father comes
And whoever surrenders to you, mother
Do you know your father? When he's angry, he becomes like a Minotaur.
You are the soul of your room; do not leave it.
Nothing else
Accidentally hit the vase, it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm afraid for him.
Mom, where did you go?
Lalalala, this is his father, not awake.
Shame on you for doing this to the boy like this, Mom.
Amzighin, his heart is broken, you want to make him forget this madness.
I say, Mom
You think, so where did the boy go?
Alright, if you want me to make you a phone.
God protect us
Auntie, I know where Walid is going.
Come on, where are you going?
Come on, come on
I am here.
And whoever surrenders to you, I don't want to go home.
I'm afraid of you.
I didn't see the vase.
Honestly, I don't know
That's how your father, may God guide him, scares you.
Come on, Mom
Don't worry, Dad, as long as I'm here at home, it's okay.
I have the solution
We didn't say anything, O Abu Walid.
Your student is asking, Abu Walid.
Just for you, I forgive her this time
I don't see him at home
Where is he, and where is Zulf?
Where is he, and where?
That's enough, Waleed. Don't be afraid; your father didn't do anything to you yesterday.
Sure, Dad
Oh, Dad, oh
You leave her here, I'm afraid one of the kids might hit her and break her.
He told me to ask for one like the one Walid broke for me.
Exactly, I went and found only this one at the store, he's lucky. Oh, woe to him. Where are the kids?
They study in the room
Come on, protect it for me
Only this value, and I will stand up.
Oh, wow
Alright, let's go, get up and study.
Dad, just this game and we'll be done.
Hey, and whoever surrenders you, don't tell my uncle.
Dad, don't say that to your brother. Dad, this is the last time, I swear, Dad.
He reaches him
And you specifically made a mistake with your friend at the coffee shop, me.
Bro, if you don't inform me, brother, you're on me.
This phone is not connected anymore, it's in my hiding place. Since they are remembering, it's over.
Mom, why don't you take him to the doctor?
God, what is this, Mom?
Amzigh is tired and afraid because he talks too much.
Poor little boy
You be you
Mom, where is Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
She went with her
My sister, she never gets enough of playing.
Hey, Mom, I didn't tell you about the story of Ameerah with her son Nayef.
Her son at the age of a newborn, may God protect him
And the same length
Yesterday you told me you don't know what to do with her son
She wanted to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef.
Yesterday, about the incident
And Wahoosha was shouted at her.
I say, how come you didn't tell me
This is a psychological condition.
The boy forcibly urinates on him.
He takes his son and ties him in the middle of the yard.
Then I tell him to do it again and pee on my bed.
You are sitting and listening in a ruin.
My dear Amnira
I tell her, eat my food, eat my food.
Enjoy your meal
Oh, what luck I have.
Mama, mama
Your father didn't feel good about you.
Wala Jan, I will slaughter you with a blow.
Come on, go to the bathroom and wash before your dad gets up and causes you trouble.
I don't care about Manj.
Forbidden, poor souls
They are sitting and crying, mourning.
I'm afraid something will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to discipline them.
I'm nervous.
They did not succeed in knocking them down.
Why do you take them to their uncle?
We scored forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they give fifty out of fifty?
They are their uncle, the cautious one
And honestly, I support his point of view.
Leave the emotions aside
I need my brother Iyad.
Bye bye bye bye
The last time, the last time
Fifty out of fifty
He wastes our time, I assure them that this is our son.
Why didn't I get fifty out of fifty?
Whenever, whenever, I warn you, but you don't listen.
What you hear is the speech
Majestic of the soul
Give me a moment, let me discipline him. Yes.
Okay, that's enough, uncle.
So that the second time you reconsider properly, you'll go back.
Come on, just.
Do you know what I'm doing?
And I bring you one after the other to make falafel.
Be careful, you go with your family to public places.
I say the confusions
Professor Walid is shouting
What's wrong with you, why are you shouting?
This is an excellent grade
It's strange that you're shouting.
You're supposed to be happy
You, my son, everyone has gone; the buses have left. I was waiting for anyone to come and take you.
At the school gate, it means waiting for the bus. The bus arrived, and the children got off, but not with them.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
Hi, God bless you, they gave him the certificate.
And his father threatened him if he didn't bring the complete mark.
Walid Walid, come back, Walid, come back
I greet you live on air and welcome you to a new episode of the program بلا حدود
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total different energy sources.
While the rest go to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power
And then, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
And the Gulf Arab countries and Iran alone possess 768 billion barrels.
Followed by Iran at twelve percent, then Iraq at ten percent, and Kuwait and the UAE at nine percent.
Each of them, then Venezuela comes with a rate of seven percent.
Then Russia with a rate of five percent
Gulf countries and Iran make up two-thirds of the world's reserves
to unprecedented prices and exceeding ninety dollars for the first time in its history
And in this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil.
And the problems faced by the exporting countries.
Despite the enormous increase in its prices
And also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise
which will appear sequentially on the screen or they can write to us via our website at www.aljazeera.net
Because today the market is the main factor
And not the producing countries
The price is determined by the market force.
It is only OPEC
Of course, the offer and demand are naturally a part of it.
But the other factors
The other factors are the political tensions
In the world
and real estate markets
And the markets of the Polish and others
And they turned to the prices of Al-Mazarebah.
In the commodities, including oil for example
And tomorrow it will reach one hundred dollars, God knows best.
Oil in 2004 jumped from forty-four dollars
And today we see that even oil prices
It fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars
And it rose in the second quarter
Especially with the arrival of spring, most of the world's refineries enter maintenance periods.
Always regarding the second quarter.
The seasonal demand for oil decreases
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all of this indicates that the negotiations currently have power and control over the market.
It often means that when we go back to the traditional market in the past
The market is affected by supply and demand.
The seasonal demand exhibition
Today we see that there is economic growth
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked huge reactions due to its connection to the so-called upcoming American war.
Political and Geopolitical Effects
It affects the oil market in a way that is either negative or positive, very quickly.
The impact may certainly come; it will have its effects.
And even with the protesters, they also engage in political protests.
He who may confirm tells you that some of them say the American war against Iran is coming.
Here, what will the market be like? The market is optimistic in its way.
Question in the shadow of His Excellency the Deputy now under the shadow of the White House
And this brought the region back to a state of tension.
This is the employee
But perhaps Valon saw this scenario.
A very rapid reflection is reflected on the oil market
Today we prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example during the seven weeks of the shining ones.
In the United States, oil inventories increased to the highest average in the past five years.
I mean, today I don't, I mean, I say
Not even for the upcoming war, because today I tell you, even the world has a bitter stockpile.
Even global consumption today, look at any country in the world, there is a long line or queues in front of petrol stations.
This is something else
What is the danger that this matter poses to
What is the number you expect could possibly be I don't know, it might be
Two hundred might be three hundred dollars, it might be less but
It may reach if these tensions have escalated to real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf accounts for sixty percent.
In a country, I mean, even far from the oil-producing countries.
See, the effect comes inversely on the oil market
And it can reach three hundred dollars
They moved and transitioned from stocks and others to the oil market today. Look above, over two trillion or two trillion dollars.
Today we are seeing the print.
He is fighting over the water barrel today, what does that mean?
These ongoing tensions in the region and anticipation
April, as previously mentioned, is to be the month to launch this war.
By God, God knows, I didn't mean my generation.
In the area because of the now
The year is an election year
And the current American administration is only a few months old.
George Bush Sr. declared war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand troops in his final days at the White House.
We observe and do not anticipate events.
But I do not expect that this scenario will be
Because this cinema scenario is very expensive
It will cost you nothing; you are the ones who will pay, you and the Iranians and the consuming countries.
America Today
Now it has become dependent on African oil and has many alternatives.
Look, there's nothing, let's speak frankly.
You said in an article in your introduction that sixty percent
Oil reserves
But now they import twenty-two.
From their oil, from the West, from West Africa
From West Africa, and no matter where they import from in the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves
On what is called deep water or aquaculture or offshore production from the deep seas
The navy, therefore, the Gulf will continue to be a tough number
and the Caspian Sea oil
And I consider it like dreams because it is not reality and the true one.
They ruin it and destroy it.
The important thing is that there
Today, Qatar is the largest exporter of energy in the world.
The matter is difficult, so this is a tough number for these countries.
There and the countries' energy needs
It definitely means that there is what is called security with secure supply.
And despite internal opposition within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still concerns
That President Bush will do
You notice that the political risks did not come from the Gulf countries.
It means no, no, no, it's not about generosity because we don't have anyone who deals with generosity, we do.
There is no dealing with generosity a lot.
But not in my article now.
We are not part of the charitable work.
He or she kindly requests
Just be generous with the Westerners, not with anyone else.
With America specifically
Where is the market
Where is the economic return for us? We will go to it.
We will not
Like oil and gas
You put it for generosity and
I have the proof
I have the proof
No more than sixty to seventy dollars
It's not the price increase
It is only the decline of the dollar that you insist on
You are primarily, as Gulf nationals and OPEC members.
That the export should be in dollars and you refuse.
Changing the currency even though the currency collapsed afterward
Although the return is not in your favor
No, I am not seventy years old.
‏It's just the experts' words, not mine.
Okay, the dollar decreased by five and thirty percent, and oil rose above this decline.
It means if we take the measurement year in 2004
I see that their oil prices range between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
It means, of course, I mean.
The oil price has increased.
Just a slight increase, the effort of the deputy
It means if we take them
So, we consider it now.
Even these prices
It means if we compare it to 2004
This has exceeded the rate of the dollar's decline
The exciting Al Al
It reacts to the decline of the dollar
The lower the dollar, the higher the oil prices.
And this too, the market has started to give it its feeling.
For the sake of interest, now this is preservation.
No, now the situation has changed. Maybe it was in the beginning of the decline two years ago, this was said then, but now the situation has changed and there is now.
And the dollar began to lose its value against major currencies such as the euro, yen, and pound sterling.
The question here is: why do you insist on linking your work to the dollar?
A currency that weakens and has no backing
This is it, this is a historical era.
Oil and its derivatives in dollars, including European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway
It states that America in the mid-1970s
She removed the gold cover that was on the American currency.
This is not, this is not correct
What is the correct primary school?
OPEC Organization
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today is OPEC's turn in the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we take that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Weak, it deals with the dollar in pricing its oil
If you value it at another currency, everyone will be...
You cannot be you
All oil-exporting countries must agree.
The adults
Those who have sixty-six percent of the global reserve are the major ones.
Tayyat, but I took it as an export.
Among them are Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameroon, Angola, and Qatar are among the countries organized under the OPEC organization.
Today’s market share does not exceed forty percent.
Produced and exported from countries outside OPEC
And this one cannot even reach forty percent.
You cannot do it yourself unless
In countries I tried but
An attempt is not my real right
You are the ones rejecting because of the ties with America
From the circle to another job
All oil-exporting countries
How many barrels are imported per day?
They are the loss when he is about to issue.
And his work has increased a lot.
And he also sells his oil in dollars.
The receiver is either not working or not receiving it. He is receiving it, taking his money in dollars, and then converting or transferring it to his local currency.
His work is not related to the dollar
That's correct, but he
But your problem is also that you sell in dollars and your currency is not linked to the dollar, so you don't have a problem.
And this is my important question now
What is the anxiety and impact caused by your work being linked to the dollar amid the dollar's decline?
has been connected for many years
Especially in the seventies when the dollar was very strong and the currency meant a very great strength.
This detachment is not easy.
The paint is easy
No here, no
Divorce has costs
It has the interests of these countries, and is not against them.
Profit and loss
Dojens announced in his post yesterday that there are four countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report from the Khaleej Finance House stating that there are four Gulf countries because, of course, Oman has exited the unified Gulf currency.
I read the statement at Dunjons and I don't think it's a real statement.
He is the director of the Qatari Central Bank, he denied it.
He said yes and said that he will study, but also that all Gulf countries should...
You must study profit and loss in a manner like I mentioned, carefully and without emotions.
Let's leave it to the study and wait until they come.
Inside, I will bring you economists who will tell you there is another study.
This study reflects
Lobal House is simple, clean, and organized. They issued a report on March 8th, I mean.
Apple only four days
Global House, the solution is simple and requires a political decision
The political decision is summarized in two facts.
There is no third for them, the first need
About her intention or the five, along with Kuwait, about her intention in 2010 to issue the currency or to study the issuance of the unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to sever the link with the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency
In my personal opinion
To see the Gulf Cooperation Council unified currency
The currency, the currency, when this currency will be strong
It will be it will be
Perhaps one of the strongest currencies in the world, as you say.
And behind it, there are precautions and behind them, massive revenues.
So this is what His Excellency the Prime Minister focused on when he said
These are the Gulf countries because no single country can dominate.
Except with a stronger economic guarantee
And an economic bloc today, even the euro today, I see it.
But you must not forget that the Central Bank has a very significant role.
In the evaluation
Profit and Loss Account
From all these news
An anxious state
Two thousand and eighty, as observers say, Global House said that inflation will continue
For a long time in the countries of the world, but the solution is in the hands of the governments
Some countries have increased salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the process of inflation that
And this is my question now: when will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
And I will hear the answer from you after a short break
On the topic of today's episode: oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It has a reserve of two hundred sixty-four billion.
And two-tenths of a barrel
And it takes nine and two-tenths days daily
One million Kuwait is one hundred and fifty, and a billion, and two point seven million.
Qatar thirteen billion two hundred twelve million and fifty-five thousand Omani five point six of ten billion and seven hundred seventy-seven thousand
Bahrain: twenty-five million and thirty-five thousand.
And the total revenues for the year were thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
In Europe, one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion
In Asia and other countries
However, the total gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was in 2007.
Total output in 2007 is expected to be 7.99 billion.
In 1989 and 2011 and one-tenth of a billion
But the inflation that devours the salaries of employees and workers living in this area
It will increase in 2028 to three and eight-tenths.
Kuwait fourteen percent, expected in 2008, and the UAE
Ten will become, Saudi Arabia was six and a half, it will reach six
Nineteen out of ten
Salaries are being eaten up
What are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the employee's salary here?
If we want to address the problem
A real treatment
Salaries are always, salary increases are always
It is not the solution
I am not against increasing salaries
Yes, I am. This is not correct.
We always
There is, of course, Iman
The issue is the excessive increase and lack of control over inflation; inflation will consume all these increases.
To address the weak swelling, a high committee comprising all experts and specialists.
And now this committee is setting up
Because of the increase in salaries worldwide
And the golden economic rule says, of course
It will have no end
And whatever
Salaries have increased, and no matter how much they rise
It will increase in inflation
Treatment is necessary, and it is necessary.
A scientific study here by the institution Bayt.com, specialized in recruitment, was conducted in collaboration with the British Yokofer Siraq.
They conducted a survey on fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries across twenty important sectors.
Especially the experts and those who have jobs, there is no satisfaction at work.
Inflation has started to consume.
There is no specific
They are considering moving from these countries where inflation is eating away at them.
You will lose now.
This is the simple idea, I mean, and you put the simple idea into practice and try to implement it.
Inflation pressure is an increase in salaries
Parallelism is present in the topic
Available
We are diligent, and the state and government are equally diligent.
Address this issue with a genuine solution
Temporary solutions never solve the problem; they only make it worse.
It means you add more to it.
We hope it will be for some more time until this committee is established.
All the applications
Here is a small one, and you are the deputy's helper.
Boredom will always be there
Haih, but the state also tried and increased the forty percent increase.
There is a very important point here regarding the increases.
Regarding the increases, you only increase the Qataris, while the non-Qataris work in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You consider Qataris but do not consider expatriates.
and it is the high ratio in it
Oh Ahmed, you are living in Qatar, not in Germany.
You speak about this topic and suffer.
Higher salaries in the government sector by a lot
And on the contrary, we saw
In the government sector
Conversely, the government sector has become
Ban Afzal is now the best element and competence
Also, I read a report, and you know, in the oil sector.
For the workforce
We are like experts with us.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
And because we also interact with the global market
For all these things, what is the percentage increase in salaries?
And hope is with Allah, the Most High, but we say
The government has a plan.
I say that controlling inflation is more important
Temporary treatment
And we will see, I am sure.
There will be a pond
Positive results
It will be around fifteen percent.
Al-Hillu Beyoul said to you, twenty-five billion from oil and thirty-four billion from gas.
No comment. We are the client, not the client of Rush.
Operation and of course we
It means that talking about economic growth must also be reflected on the people.
And of course, any economic growth today reflects that Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa
The heavy belts in the country are also part of it.
If it weren't for these huge conveyors and large-scale projects
The country also did not have a part of the inflation.
It also caused part of the swelling.
And this also led to an increase in liquidity in the market.
Firstly, regarding the correlation between the dollar and oil
Collateralized the oil in exchange for protection from
Therefore, stability in governance is something that means...
Thank you
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad
Peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.
The truth is, the ring means success and a good title
What I would like to address is that the region is now under the current policy of America.
America's policy in its current war, along with the cultural campaign it is conducting against Islam, is part of a global economic war.
In Yemen now, China
The American deficit also reached sixty-one billion dollars with Japan.
Japan also had invested in the year 2000
With America, what is equivalent to nine.
One billion dollars while she is currently investing more than twenty-seven billion dollars with the European Union.
In line with American politics and making the dollar an inevitable currency for the entire world
My brother, I say that the purchase is now.
And the Gulf region will become
It means a place of K K K.
Thank you, brother Saad
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Hello, Sa'a Al-Nayib is with you
The efforts of the deputy remind me of the Arab rulers in the Middle East region.
When there is
When there are congestions or demands for price adjustments
Salary adjustments, salary adjustments in relation to prices as you kindly mentioned.
It means that in Qatar, we consider you to be a model.
And he is determined not to evangelize this increase; this is an Arab style.
We consider this Qatar as our father figure.
He is from Hoh, from Hoh, he says what he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? It is his right, of course. He is responsible for this policy.
Question first
The deputy is keen to take into consideration
One Two to communicate with the public
With the poor, as Your Excellency kindly mentioned, because they are the people who accept to be cared for.
The Arab rulers who don't care about the oppressed
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
I want to greet you both in the evening and greet Al-Aqeel in the evening
I also want a raise in my salary.
The salaries are excellent and good, okay, good.
May Allah bless you. As for the matter, regarding us, we need to work on understanding it.
With the poor, and always, God willing, there will be no oppression in Qatar, and we are confident.
And the ruling states that Qatar, as he said, the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
That's the important question now
Let's go ahead and respond to the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What is happening with this wealth
Now there are entire new cities, almost pearl-like Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar has started to expand.
This is not the issue, it is the issue.
A proportionate urban plan
In short, because there are two minutes left, what Qatar will do to him.
Qatar now is there, Qatar beyond oil and gas
There is, of course, a clear policy for the state.
Because she is not
Accumulating wealth
Because of the wealth of Nadhba
And therefore today the trend in the State of Qatar
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the city of culture, the educational city
Today, this educational city hosts the best universities in the world.
Establishment of medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today, oil and gas are not available
Of course, we do not imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels and
Not just the island, it means you'll make a hundred islands and can't handle the island.
Because, my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
During the boom of the seventies, now everyone remembers the boom of the seventies.
Today, today we see growth in Qatar
And this also calls for a special discussion about Qatar beyond oil.
Our vision regarding oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I send you the regards of the program team.
And this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
I greet you live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha
And I welcome you to a new episode of the program بلا حدود
While Qatar hosts the largest American military base outside the United States, which is the Air Force Base
With the enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy excellent relations with the Qatari leadership.
As was the Emir of Qatar, he was the only Arab leader.
Who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006.
And still an unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon
And at the time when Qatar reconciled and at the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, about two years ago
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt
Like the Lebanon file where I succeeded where others failed
The Lebanese leaders gathered in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them safely.
to the last elections
As well as files that are resistant
which cared that she be the driving force behind these files and not Qatar
The smallest Arab countries
And in today's episode
We try to understand the principles and rules from which Qatar's foreign policy is based.
And in whose interest
The small Qatar geographically and demographically plays these major roles.
And what are the qualifications that enable her?
And this was in a live interview with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar.
And for our viewers wishing to participate, they can contact the program's phone numbers, which will appear sequentially on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar
Hadeer, a defender of Al Jazeera channel, wishes to improve relations with Saudi Arabia
From the past, an attempt of a Saudi coup against the Emir of Qatar in cooperation with members of the Marrah tribe
In its issue published on June 20th of last year
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many of the issues that
I don't think it's accurate.
The precise thing is that I, in more than one interview here on this program, I always say
And we consider it the backbone
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding
Then that
and differences of opinion
I solved the border issue correctly, and this was a major obstacle.
Saudi-Qatar historical relations are distinguished relations
These relationships, if we observe them
Between the two families and between the two countries
It resembles some misunderstanding.
Neither before us nor before them
Because there are no conditions among the brothers
And now the relations are in a state that I can confirm is very excellent.
For the benefit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
But how was the situation with Al Jazeera channel and Saudi Arabia resolved? Was it the obstacle or the reason that led to the year 2007?
An important point
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, I always say
Not only the elder sister, but I was saying that our reliance in the Gulf Cooperation Council is on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region
And our relations with her are given importance
There was media sparring, and this was clear to both parties.
These countries found themselves
Failed when the brothers agreed
The Qatari-Saudi private house
Rather, they found that the most important thing was that they got into a dispute.
They have neither a she-camel nor a camel in it.
And I don't think it was a strategy from anyone involved in this disagreement.
But Sheikh, forgive me, forgive me here in this context so that things or points are clear.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has in the past two years
At a time when the conditions that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen still persist
Due to the situation inside Saudi Arabia
Whether the detained people, opponents, or others, the list still exists.
Al-Sal Al-Jazeera has ceased discussing these matters.
Until the coverage of the island in Hajj
In praise of the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts
First of all, you can ask the Al-Jazeera administration about this matter, don't ask me because I am
The gathering of the two countries
Regional stability
This strategy continued and strengthened, primarily stabilizing the region.
The area refers to the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many issues affecting the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait
It had an impact on all the attendees and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about resolving Arab disputes, overcoming them, and burying them.
It only means in opinions
No, it is in policies and policies are opinions
The Arab world considers this
A kind of war
While in the developed world
She is talking about the same interest
Now you have been counting for several years
The current situation, the current situation
First, look
There is a complete difference between this topic and that topic.
The idea that a small country is striking at the big ones and making them feel weak in front of it
Any disagreement or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And his reasons have ended
It ended with the judgment of the two leaders
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties
Based on love, brotherhood, and the interests that unite the two countries
And the two leaders' words are considered more than a document
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship
And we hope that many of these Qatari-Saudi relations will develop.
For the best, and there are large fields there.
For this relationship, just as we have a model with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Regarding Qatar, a significant country
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What kind of country is Egypt compared to Qatar, so that it was noticed at the same time you reconciled with Saudi Arabia?
And three organizations are Hezbollah
He is the Al Jazeera channel.
And on the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country
First, let me start with the next beginning.
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian nation
and its interest
Many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
And this is a case
He believes that this is a matter through which we want to open a door to understanding or misunderstanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In this shadow, in this shadow, you will interpret that we respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
And we believe that he is a kind person
Our disagreement with Egypt is in two points
He is a dot
We told him that we prepared for the coup in Gaza, and I don't think so.
And we don't enter
In issues concerning other countries
Do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
So, any intervention you have in the coup carried out by Hamas against the authority in Gaza.
Of course, it's not that we actually knew about this except as the others knew it through the media.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties.
What caused Egypt to differ or have a disagreement with you on this point?
This one is coming for me.
Hezbollah conspiracy
Hezbollah's conspiracy as well
But I am talking about my country
We were very surprised by this issue.
If it is shaken for Qatar's benefit
What is the purpose of the pyramids?
Al-Ahram reported that I reached.
To undermine Egypt and its status
Can I reply?
Let's go back to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this issue.
It's not the beginning of the Gaza Conference
And I justify, I absolve the Egyptian people from her; I absolve President Hosni Mubarak from her.
If we go back a lot to the Mina Conference
After the Madrid Conference, do you remember the marina that was held in Doha?
And this was an agreement for when the conference would be held with us.
They said that we do not want to hold the conference.
Guys, we know that you have coordination with Israel.
I'm from Qatar, and this is it.
What we want to understand is what
We sat down, we left, we talked, and the talk is always good.
It has two parts
What are they?
In disagreement
In the political orientation
When we came to the Gaza conference, what happened
His Highness the Prince speaks with all the presidents, including his brother, His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
And we have been informed by a foreign country
The brothers in Egypt have a point of view on this issue: that it is not worth it to complicate things.
And they kill people while we watch.
If you don't want to meet in Doha, we can hold it anywhere at the Arab University.
And it is shameful that on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference I am discussing an issue.
Before Israel and the Western world, he is standing and watching the issue.
When we came, we said okay, now this is ongoing, and there is no power or strength. We Arabs cannot stop it; no major state has halted this fighting.
Egypt announces a call to cease fighting in Qaza; an hour later, the fighting stopped.
So, even we
We should not take the Arab street with such naivety; our disagreement with the brothers is only on one point.
And this is at the international borders
And our hospitals are not enough; doctors are standing at the borders.
You stopped at the borders
There is nothing and no one was allowed to enter
The brothers were very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the allergy is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national lands.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect the sovereignty of Egypt
And he knows the position, but this does not harm the Egyptian stance.
And we have high hopes for Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And I believe you can convey our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
To all the other parties
It means even the rescue operation after the explosion.
The Europeans tried to save it.
What happened in Gaza at the conference
Both the donor conference and I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference; we were invited to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And we gathered in the Council of Cooperation
These amounts will not be spent on any party.
But you will spend
To the affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and that was
Because entry is prohibited from all sides.
I rejoice for Egypt and all the people of Qatar rejoice for Egypt because Egypt
The victory of Egypt in political matters is important to us.
But you jump the gun
Just give me a moment, just give me a couple of minutes.
One of the ministers boasted proudly about what was achieved and said
And whoever tries to outdo Egypt here, we will cut his leg and break his arm.
By God, I believe this official has wronged his country.
No, they did not fail, and they could only talk about themselves when it comes to the truth.
The one who helped them in this and that, I told my brothers that Saudis, the Saudis, intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
Are things difficult in the Arab world
We agree
The king declares that this is the interest.
We accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But if anyone says they prevented us, even insulting those who prevented us
They are like students in a school.
I think this.
The edge is sharp
He believes that he should exert his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this matter.
If they believe that a small country has no right, the right has been taken away from it.
You guys are sticking your noses into Darfur.
Arab decision at the Arab League
African and a resolution from the United Nations
I believe the main problem
Hezbollah's conspiracy was joined by Qatar
Conspiracy, I don't know what Qatar
It means that if he walks, maybe after swine flu, if he starts somewhere, it could be due to a cluster that might be spreading the epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and its capabilities.
But Qatar has its point of view
Qatar has a separate policy
Qatar, if it can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because there is no Arab disagreement
Any Arab disagreement, we believe, weakens our position before our main issues, which are Palestine and the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a recipient.
Even our analyses have become the same as yours.
Western Analyses
As far as we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
I swear, I want someone to welcome me and lay out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Has anyone blamed Qatar?
Did Qatar offend any Arab country?
You tried to contribute financially.
These contributions are provocative
Maybe I will come and say peace be upon you, and you will tell me you greeted me just to annoy me.
This is another issue, meaning you have a problem or a deficiency.
This is a matter that concerns you, not me.
But if you have an internal problem
I always say it
And especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah
In Kuwait, and I know this man, he is honest.
And a man whose words are what he conceals.
In his heart, no, no, no, I always say this.
I always say this.
I always say it; during our intense disagreement with Saudi Arabia, I used to say this.
And go back to all the documents you have in the island, but
The issue is different, no no no no no
On one side, we said no, enough, we stop at this point.
And we tried as much as possible
I don't want to get into this topic.
They see their affairs, they see where their mistakes are.
And we see our mistakes; it doesn't mean that everything we have is right.
This is His Excellency Sheikh
due to internal problems in Egypt
They want to leave it.
Qatar denies any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and has severed its relations with Turkey or other countries.
By God, we have a supernatural power.
And Mashallah, seventy million; if we are able, we can reach eighty.
They also have a problem that needs to be addressed.
You played a role in the Gilad Shalit case despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country
Indeed, in the case we see, we said, "O brothers," this is with the Egyptians, they said
We want to see this issue upon request.
Before Israel and other countries, I think the other side should see this issue.
When we saw this issue, we told them, "Brothers, if the same conditions apply as with the brothers you are talking to in Egypt."
And we announced this, meaning there is someone responsible who says, in essence, that he has deceived the entire Arab university.
By God, this means, I mean, poor guy.
So, how did he pass it to us?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains
And we support this
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your side.
I think I think this is a healthy phenomenon
I'm not the owner of the island as you accused.
And Al Jazeera must enter the media competition just like in the West, where there are many media outlets.
There are many media outlets; during adolescence, they all curse at each other.
But after a while, they reach the stage of maturity.
Maybe, maybe, and maybe not
First of all, we are with Saudi Arabia; our stance differs.
And even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relations
And Egypt is an important country, but there is privacy in Saudi relations.
And also, a special relationship for Egypt with any Arab country; Egypt is the greatest and largest country.
That's correct. That's correct, but with Saudi Arabia, in history and in a different relationship.
It is a personal disagreement between the officials here and there.
We respect the dignity of the Egyptian President
I hope that it is limited to disagreements over policies and viewpoints.
I told you there's a problem when the attack on Gaza happened
The second problem is that they have an allergy that we have not yet discovered from anything Qatar or similar does.
Why don't you now try to arrange a meeting with the Egyptian president between the prince?
Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter
And as reported by the newspapers, they said the first thing was a secret meeting, then we found out it was the next day.
There is a conversation between me and Omar Suleiman.
in Saudi Arabia
The Irreversible Tragedy
And I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's say so that no one interprets it as you comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity for both the young and the old.
The Minister of Egypt received the appropriate compensation, the compensation.
The rivalry among children
I don't think this is Egypt, Egypt is bigger than this. I think it's a matter of expression.
Do you have a vision to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you just waiting for divine intervention while the Egyptian people suffer?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything else because God knows who will live and who will die.
And here I am praying
He convinced himself that there would be a method.
And our pride is Egypt
There must be a specific way.
Either stop with me or stop in front of me
Wow, any Arab citizen can suffer in it.
In the Arab world, we feel pain for it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
States derive their strength from sources of power
The United States has sources of power, China has sources of power, France has sources of power, a small country, Qatar.
I rely on God
What is clear is that there is none.
All of this is just nonsense you're constantly doing
But we are a small country, and I accept that gladly.
And I repeat it a hundred times
So no one says that we have allergies
None of us will seize it.
You have now, regarding Israel, tickled.
Medicine before I go to Israel
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt?
The problem wasn't there from the beginning either
And every day they file complaints against America, if I tell you the major countries you're talking about
They deal with us out of self-interest, and we deal with them out of self-interest.
All complaints and everything
In order to sabotage the relationship
I think it diminishes any major country that does that.
It also diminishes our Arab dignity that we go and complain about others.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on Arab interests
And we are with them in anything
Are there any upcoming steps to repair the relations?
But I know that there are intimate relations between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone was involved in any matters
As the two countries approach each other, the one who finds himself losing in the end
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe after ten years. I swear I don't know, I mean, from our side, we always attend any conference that invites us.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
What we can do
Because Egypt is our elder sister in every matter, but we have a point of view and we discuss it.
This is all that's required whenever the time comes. Of course, we are pleased with this matter.
It was canceled due to this policy.
And as I mentioned, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, canceling a contract and adding a contract. You ask about how many cancellations; ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But the policy of the country, as I told you, the Egyptian people are very close to us in Qatar from the bottom of our hearts.
Now, on June 4th, you stirred the emotions of Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office. On June 4th, it was published by Arts.
Why do you say we teased him? If we wanted to tease them, we would have done it twelve years ago; we closed it.
When Shanine was in charge, everyone supported him before they made peace with Israel and before secret meetings took place between some Arab countries and Israel.
And after, and after, and after, after most Arabs reconciled
Whether under the table or over the table with Israel or talking to it with any of the attributes.
If we wanted to tickle the emotions, we would have tickled them at the previous Islamic conference.
In the United Nations, Nasser Abdel Nasser hosted a banquet at the Israeli embassy in Beilagi.
Yes, he was a guest among many guests attending the banquet, I don't know for what occasion the ambassador hosted it.
Because we sit together with Israel at the United Nations, no one denies this issue.
We found a glimmer of hope in alleviating the suffering of our brothers in Palestine.
Now the management has changed the matter; Egypt was a small part of my concern, but unfortunately
I didn't raise him; you did.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and how that affects your relationship as Qataris with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There is a disagreement in viewpoints
A road that solves many issues in the area
And if they are serious, we will help them to the fullest extent.
A special relationship or a solution to the issues that were ongoing between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar yesterday in Paris spoke about what is happening in Iran
And Iran has a special relationship with you despite its poor relations with the United States.
Look, first of all, it must be placed within the framework of internal affairs because we must respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri stated in this program that the Doha agreement ends with the holding of the elections.
Is this also your view, or do you see the agreement as existing, or will you insist on a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for the phase that would lead them to hold a peaceful election.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha elections.
We were following them day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
We intervened recently in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a connection to arranging matters in Lebanon
We are always close to Lebanon. You know, Qataris love Lebanon and go to Lebanon from, I mean.
So I am the first country I visited after a Western country, Lebanon.
Quick answer question about what is happening in Yemen
You intervened in the Houthis' case, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
At least your intervention should put them in a club with the state. Now there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the south.
And we suffered from what we suffered, this is the same reason why you didn't stop here and why you stopped here in Qatar.
And for now, we faced many pressures on this issue, but this was our vision and this is His Highness the Prince's stance on this matter.
Houthi issue
And its stability has a positive effect, while its instability has a negative effect on us.
Our intervention was through Nazeha's mediation between the two parties.
And we signed an agreement
But I understand that if this is intended to be exploited for other reasons
And I will be with them there, and we always stood with them in every matter.
And he has no basis of health
I think we don't need to.
We sell it
And I say this while I am not sorry, I know that there are many Arab fans who are against me.
We thank you, dear viewers, hoping for your continued attention, hoping that we have clarified some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy for you.
In conclusion, I send you the greetings of the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional interview because
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor
Sir, a simple and straightforward question
I think it happened because there was Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we experienced that when we went to the United Nations
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese decision from both sides was important.
To reach results
It is very important that external interference
Many opinions or many suggestions from abroad
Lebanese International Arabic if you love, say it
But it went through stages.
There is nothing except what means that these stages existed.
Does it mean the complications in Lebanon?
Actually, for a while
So now, when you met and directly engaged with the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file
Did you realize that the Lebanese crisis is a major crisis?
Lebanese, Arab, regional, international; requires significant decoding.
She is a very simple small contract, but it was exaggerated due to external interference.
Because we know Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
Lebanese people must not allow
It affects the security and peace in Lebanon.
The number one problem
External repercussions on Lebanon
You suddenly decided, I mean after twenty-four hours, to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar
He didn't even expect it, I mean they couldn't rest for a single minute except for what you graciously provide them.
The secret, the secret, the secret is that I don't let them rest and think too much.
And they make many contacts, that was the secret
The idea is to transfer them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
And she will gather them in many various difficulties
Under many circumstances
So we have brought them out for these circumstances because you are coming to solve.
If we want to succeed, we must remove them from this environment.
And quickly
Oh God, oh God, grant us success in the art of eloquence, the eloquence of the Venetian or the eloquence of Beirut.
Then we succeeded in convincing them, and they agreed to go to Doha.
The two parties decided to go to Doha
Some people believe that, for example, Qatar leans towards one side against the other.
And from Beirut, but
It means His Highness the Prince's policy that if we are mediators
In this process
Medicine, honestly, the Sheikh's country
Did you have a serious consultation?
With the two main parties involved at least as it is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And he expressed his support for the idea.
It means we benefited from Prince Saud by us
Everyone wanted a solution
His justifications are weak
If you go, if you go to the mind
His justifications are weak
It should have been removed because there is tension between us in Palestine.
There is the Iranian nuclear issue.
The Arab University must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
The African Union is better than us at solving issues.
He is trying to gather the pieces.
And conferences are held to resolve the Arab issues that you have been gathering for years and cannot solve.
They should unite the Arabs or gather the factions if they exist, or intervene to support the oppressed.
He must study
If we want it to be in the consciousness of the Arab University, not the Arab World University.
He has the car, a tool for execution.
One of the officials here was President Nabih Berri.
Sin Sin requires
Now it means that Lebanese agree.
By God, look, I mean, we
The first one is Qatar
It never led to a result.
For the Arab interest
He is a strength for the Arabs
We tried it in several places.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha agreement
And the agenda is the solution to the issue, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that
And the most important role they have in the Arab world overall.
In a situation
We agreed to stop it.
For others, come help us
Because this is a serious issue and this is a serious issue but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing on our field?
In our arena
It is very important that the interests of our peoples and the people prevail.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia
What will we do in Somalia? Not a member of the Arab League.
Why don't we try to make Sudan a member of the Arab League? Iraq is not a member of the Arab League.
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope that this is what we are proposing, this idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that first, if we are asked for something, we do what we can.
But I am sure that the Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and his brother President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement
It can be a passing phase
We find a mother after her, God willing.
Nevertheless, I insist on asking, if you please, can you play a role in this regard?
Even if unofficially now, you have become, I mean, gained some confidence.
What kind of rapprochement between Arab countries are we striving for?
And this is His Highness's policy from the beginning, but I mean this issue.
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is a Lebanese domestic matter; regional issues are still ongoing.
Not very attached to this situation
I hope the opposite, I hope this
A new beginning, a new situation in the Arab world, this is my wish.
We can create
It will happen somewhere else
In other words, Sheikh's state, are you afraid that the escalation that was ongoing some time ago
At least from here until the end of President George Bush's term
There is no doubt that my anxieties still remain, whether it's about Palestine or, specifically, the Gaza issue now.
So, I want to ask.
We don't want anything else.
He commands me to pay attention to this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can deliver medicine to them.
and food
Kahraba for the patient in the hospital
The one who doesn't die when the power goes out
I mean, I wish
As the Arab League, we agree on an amount for this issue: medicine and food. Let's call it medicine and food.
Man, I don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to go into the details of this issue; I just say that we Arabs must deliver the medicine and the food even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia made an effort and pledged in the Holy Kaaba.
Because this is a disagreement that only the other party will benefit from
Do not deal with this party because we will provide you with a solution. This is incorrect information.
And I
I still don't see any signs of a solution in front of me.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian confrontation in the upcoming period, or are you inviting it?
This is a very common phrase, of course, we
At least talk about the State of Qatar
Iran is an important neighbor to us
We may not agree on every system, or they may not agree on Qatar's policies.
They, for example, say to us that we do not desire your relations with Israel or your contact.
Perhaps some consider you to necessarily be a party through the American bases located there.
We know how to deal with this issue.
Some have said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
As if he met, consulted, or talked with the Saudi family
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel
And I can say by pure coincidence
The second topic: The Kingdom was keen on finding a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours
Changing the tactic of changing the tactic of negotiations
By you or by the parties?
We are responsible for this.
And from all sides, we closed the room on ourselves.
And in the end, we found ourselves, and then His Highness the Prince entered; it was important.
And from it, the invention moved forward
The one without mentioning her now has ended
And it was a clear message when he said, "We know our size, our position, and our role," etc.
He wanted to play the role of Munoon without provoking any other party.
Whether Arab, regional, or international
However, nonetheless
He became responsible
Whether you wanted it or not
It means that some jealousy, some of us want to avoid jealousy because we are a country.
That these countries
You can work or
I think this will be the most comfortable combination.
Maybe one last or second to last question: Is your current relationship with Wauchantan a warm, lasting, and distinguished one?
So, our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say.
There are certainly different viewpoints on issues.
But this is our right, and if they are talking about democracy, this is democracy.
How is she good, I mean how do you translate it on the ground as being good, your relationship with
It means that if you talk about the economy, she is excellent; if you talk about education, she is excellent.
If you are talking about health, if you are talking about politics, I can tell you that it is fine.
In your opinion, and very clearly, during the next phase
In my opinion, we should leave the issue of confronting Israel.
And when we want to stop the scene in play in the Arab arena
We mend the rift among the Palestinians.
We agree on an opinion so that we can be a respectable force.
I don't think we have it.
That we be something effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for your kind follow-up. Until another meeting, God willing. With my appreciation to you.
Welcome, viewers, to this interview with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We try to anticipate the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Saada Sheikh, welcome and hello
To investigate what is happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this dialogue we can
To shed light on some of your questions
The entry of the Israelis into Gaza by land.
And our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Her dealings with friendly countries
and the brotherly countries
And how to try to find a clear and strong Arab stance that the Arab countries
And then we find areas for reconciliation
Before us, it is known that more than one Arab country has violated
In an arbitrary manner
And no one was held accountable while
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
We are the only ones we always target in the world
We always discipline with style
I think not
to the extent that we will not be able
To meet at the level of leaders
We stopped his punishment attack, we are the ones.
We did not want to create a gap in the Arab world
And there were five other verbal approvals.
by a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
We hope we are correct and that our perspective is wrong because the goal
Solving the problem now is not the goal of holding a summit
But is she just going to stand by the blood of the Palestinians?
The ministerial request we made now does not cancel Qatar's request.
And also His Highness confirmed it.
In his speech, he said that we are not insisting on the inconvenience of it being in Qatar; we are not insisting that it be in Qatar. The summit can be anywhere.
An Arab stance that respects us and others
Yes, as for the ministerial
So we want to tell them that the UN Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
She was not concerned with the decision and continued, and she still kills and bombs Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we should do
What are we going to do?
Is it after Israel ends?
Implement the remaining part of the Security Council resolution
There might be a stance since Israel did not stop
We do not force our brothers to shoot.
Regarding the decision, it is considered that the invoice has been missed
Since a few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You support this proposal in the end.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea, as well as the idea of some Arab countries. Also requested for the summit: Syria, Yemen.
There is already an Arab crack present.
And all of us are heading towards the camp of moderation
and the camp of imbalance
And what do they mean by imbalance?
The one who has separated us from the West
The Arabs who are called moderates and the Arabs who are non-moderates
We find that there is a moderate nation and a non-moderate nation.
And then we want to know what moderation and extremism are. Is moderation walking according to Israeli plans?
and ending the issue in an humiliating manner
Or that we just need to keep the issue alive
That is an important question.
The topic is whether the countries
She is following Israel's plans and wants to resolve issues through methods
I do not say that she is following Israel's plans, nor do I want to accuse anyone.
But I say
Unless we call it the Moderate Camp
What is moderation in the view of the West
Do we agree to slaughter a certain group of Palestinians?
Of course, there was an election.
I'm not a supporter or non-supporter of Hamas, but I'm talking about reality.
The reality that exists is that there is
Idea
Some of what they call the ridiculous movement
But we need to ask ourselves, what does this radical move demand?
She is just claiming her right; her mother is asking for her rights.
Or we separate them
And we also create other things.
Because we are
Arab intellectual interior
And this started happening
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Sheikh Saada, in brief
Who prevented the Arab summit from being held
I can't say no because there are pressures and everyone knows the matter.
The topic of prohibition
But as I mentioned to you, we could have been
Let's take a vote and get the two-thirds.
But this was not the goal, because it is not a challenge issue as much as we believe it is an urgent matter.
I think it's something non-urgent.
Alright, we went to the Security Council.
or in a UN Security Council resolution
But the Security Council's decision, Israel said, is that it will continue and then look into the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We are not diligent in applying the decision to the weakest party.
How will it differ from the first meeting?
The topic of conflicts usually involves disagreements and differences of opinion.
As much as it is important
Are we ready to have a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
From supporting our brothers clearly
And also addressing the Israeli side, I tell them
This assumes that we look for it, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab initiative?
Eighty-four, and we are committed. We committed to the ceasefire for eighty-four, and the Israelis did not commit.
It's natural that disagreements occur in meetings, but in reality, those disagreements
Expresses attitudes that reflect inner feelings within certain souls, meaning
One of the disputes she learned about is
There are those who describe Hamas's movement as a gang.
And not even at least
This is an incident that happened, and we responded to it in the presence of one of the ministers.
And I believe that this means what the West is saying
That these are radical movements and these are factions, and someone says these are like this.
And I do not want us to be other people's men
And therefore, always, I mean, I don't mean anyone in particular.
Any foreigner they find
Either a Western country or Western countries you find
Among the Arabs
Yes, okay, Your Excellency the Sheikh now
Invitation to the second ministerial meeting
By God, his supposed agenda is one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from what is happening, and what is the stance of the Thirtieth Nation and what?
One million Israel Soft
The one issued resulted in a decision of one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six.
The decision that was issued
Israel has not implemented it yet; Israel has not applied it after completing the task.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort
Thanks for this decision.
We are requesting Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel
And if they are asked again, they also say to them, we understand.
It's not the Arabs' fault if they...
If that's the case, Israel does not question.
And she is above international law
This is a reality
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link holding an Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will seek us.
It requires a difficult decision
to the decision
An official has lost his position
We, the West, are afraid.
And we are among those who strive that after they decide, for example
I don't want to leave the topic.
Those who carried out this attack on the reconstruction of Iraq entirely at their expense because they destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government nor ask the people who have died.
There are no compensations
Exactly the same thing in Sudan, as soon as they started talking about the trial of Bashir
Saada Al Sheikh
Saa'da Al-Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory in the Security Council
Look, there were difficulties for them in the Security Council because the initial discussion was about a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel did not comply with it
You will commit after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
Because they did not comply with the decision
Sorry, people are supposed to comply.
Because Israel accepts after the mission is completed
You have an alternative to this decision now.
Everything that we have done
We carried out some of the brothers' work unfortunately due to their effort.
They participated in the Gaza siege
I am a friend of the West and I don't mind having a relationship with the West, and I am not
Against the West, not against America
But these people understand the language of interests
Your friends if you are strong
Or if you have an opinion
And finally, our point of view is taken from which one in a hundred, and we say we have won.
What is victory
What it contains
I cannot say right now what reservations there are because the decision is not
And the council is its own master
You participated in the formulations.
He participated with us in the formulations to some extent, yes, he participated with us.
But you did not invite the Arab ministers to meet with the American Secretary of State.
But I am sure the brothers who went to iPhone are with us.
I pointed to Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this field, Sheikh Saadah
Since two years ago up to the present moment
Look, I don't want to talk about accusations
I can't claim that we have uncovered everything.
Are they people
An Israeli rejection, an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here, the disagreement began and the siege started.
And Israel last month killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And they keep gathering until we exhaust them because we don't want them to be in power.
Those those edges, happiness, Sheikh
She clearly states that the Palestinian-Palestinian disagreement
It means if there is
Who is the one who created the Palestinian disagreement? Maybe it was a Palestinian-Palestinian dispute.
I say to the other side, you are right, a hundred in the water.
I'm not saying that Hamas is completely right.
I do not claim that nor do I say that
But May, the mediator, is usually an intermediary at a distance from everyone.
And I don't mean just the mediator, I mean us Arabs being on the same page with everyone.
And we do not want it to be present, so we must end it by any means.
Once training the right and left forces
And once they are besieged and not given money or salaries
And once we create a positive model in the western region
The people in Gaza see how the people are living.
Aisha Mabhbaha f f f
In contrast to that in Gaza
You are invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time.
The discussion regarding it is still ongoing between Hamas through Turkish mediation and
This meeting you called for seems to be an attempt to circumvent.
If we took another initiative
We don't have initiatives
In this topic
Because Egypt is an important Arab country
And it is required of her to play a role, and we, I mean any Egyptian effort that leads to reaching an understanding
But it is important
We do not come
Tomorrow, it seems like one side has won over the other.
And there is no path to harmony
Balanced Egyptian initiative
Between the requirements of international, Arab, and humanitarian standards
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is a significant role.
She is a leading Arab country that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required, in your opinion, regarding Egypt.
Are the current initiatives and proposals not meeting those requirements, Your Excellency Sheikh?
I have a vision about the initiative.
What has been announced about it, we hear from here and there, information about it.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the government or the Palestinian presidency, they must be present, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Waiting on a side; we need to take their opinion.
So that we can ensure this mediation succeeds
By the way, I took his point of view.
Hamas's position was clear that this decision was not made with our approval, meaning how could it be issued.
A decision in which the Arabs participate in its formulation without contacting or consulting the main party concerned with the issue.
We just want, I mean, of course, we deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with it as authority, let's say, one-sided party.
But now there is a split, with one side in one place and the other side in another.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we should disregard our dealings with the group present in the West Bank or the Palestinian Authority.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they ask for a limit from Gaza, he will be with them.
And now we have started to coordinate together.
I did not announce what I announced about it.
First, the decision is not to say to him that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it to form a mechanism
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from my reading of the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative succeeds in performing
He stops the fighting
I don't doubt them, I have brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council's decision
And you consider that this decision has become as if it does not exist since Israel did not accept it.
Even if I accept it later, the circumstances on the ground will have already changed.
Yes, Your Excellency Sheikh, in the talk about Egyptian efforts, Egyptian efforts.
Turkish efforts also share with her at the same time and was
About Arab incapacity
A mother about Arab disputes that cannot be resolved, so he came to occupy a position.
It was supposed to be occupied by Arab sides.
I welcome Turkey's stance
And an attitude that must be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims
Turkey is an Islamic country
And therefore, this natural role
And people have to follow me.
There is no Arab consensus to address the situation.
One says, let them finish the mission.
There must be a clear Arab stance against this aggression, its continuation, and the procrastination.
An icon facing an Arab position
It means Israel is capable of falling into the trap. I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are among the people who always advocate for peace.
No, we are a country, so we should live safely.
But I don't ask for an Arab war, I ask for a stance.
Clear Arabic
In the context of discussing initiatives and proposals, of course, you are following what is happening.
and the proposals and conditions set by the Hamas movement
Do you think
As an observer now, the reality on the ground
And the politician who emerged from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions
He must be the right one.
We agree on this point; we do not agree with you on this point.
The second thing
They're not here now, they're negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation, just like I told you.
The second thing
Okay, so in the situations required of the Arabs
This Arab reality
What we witnessed after the start of those operations
It is certain that the stance in the Arab street is far, far ahead of
We, the governments
Of course, I regret that some describe this as a state of popular uprising.
Sometimes they tell me this issue
Represent the opinions of our peoples
The presidents now
It means if they want to.
At least they see what
Of course, there is a high ceiling and there is a modest ceiling.
The normalization halt, the halt of diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar Ban
The Israeli embassy office in Doha is closing.
The Qatar that takes this stance
It is considered that the Arab side should be radical and take radical stances.
Anything the Arabs agree upon, we agree on collectively.
Absolutely, we are in an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready
We align ourselves with our Arab brothers
But there should be a clear Arab decision and credibility.
And they deal with others, not just the countries that have relations.
Even the countries that do not have relations
Very important
We are not clients of others
He says, why isn't Qatar a model in this field
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want
An Arab model Qatar commits part of its Arab commitment
like
And no one goes to sell anyone to the limit
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is lacking.
And I don't want to say we went, unfortunately I don't want to say brokers
And therefore, very important
An official call anywhere because we must rise above this.
Some of them summoned the ambassador, some filed protests, some expelled the ambassador, like Chavez, for example.
And this is part of the disagreement
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned are the permanent members of the Security Council—five ambassadors—and these are all movies about our peoples.
It means we spoke with the modest ceiling of the popular demand.
At the top ceiling, there are those demanding to open fronts; there are those demanding Syria to open its front with Israel.
Look, I told you we pray for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not seek to fight with Israel
To carry out fighting against Israel
And how will we agree
This is not a problem either
What made us talk to each other and overcome our differences is
What I was deceived by is what Sheikh Saad said that
Provided that countries do not sell to each other
What do you mean
It means now
The street won't spare us
Saada Al Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the Lebanon war?
She considers that there is a difference
No, I think there is a difference between the goals.
So Lebanon had its territories liberated.
The remaining parts, of course, are under the assumption that they are a deposit with the United Nations.
or similar to that
Lebanon means we have dealt with the Lebanese issue extensively.
Israel, of course, needs neighboring countries to be weak.
Until you dominate, even though you hold the upper hand.
And of course, there are countries supported by foreigners.
And therefore, she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
They change this example in Gaza
In Lebanon, you speak with a few sects.
And how many directions
While Lebanon is in Palestine, talking about only one side
But I want to reassure you that the Palestinians' problem is that they listened to the Arabs too much and to foreigners.
Two sides, and from here the gap started, and everyone believes they can control the other side.
In your opinion, K K K observer and follower
As planned, it ends with a broken bone
As Arabs, do we accept this because this example may be repeated for those who are difficult?
He says his opinion
Neither for Israelis nor others in the future
And we set an example
The highest in obedience and in helping to break the bone
It's like a saying we have: "My cousin and I against the stranger," and "My brother and I against my cousin."
We currently assume any disagreement with Hamas, and I do not say that Hamas or anyone else is infallible or immune from error or authority.
They all have mistakes
Now I must not pass this issue.
On kneeling side
Because here, failure will not be the failure of the group.
Saada Sheikh Qatar Saada has been initiating proposals for some time now.
and solutions initiatives, that happened in Lebanon
It happened in Darfur. We will talk about this issue, even briefly, in a little while.
that we
We don't want to burden our brothers because sometimes there is sensitivity.
As long as a country undertakes all these initiatives, we have no objection; the important thing is to resolve the issue.
We're not aiming to put Qatar on a higher headline right now.
It was not among the goals of His Highness the Prince.
These were his goals: how to stop this bleeding
And we will stop this tyranny
What happened is beyond imagination
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something they don't know? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
Honest in reaching an honorable solution
Talking about initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative stands regarding Darfur and the Justice and Equality Movement.
and the Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will be specific to solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem initially started.
The Arabs helped
But what is the issue we have reached internationally?
Based on that, we will take revenge on the regime, and now we want to resolve the issue but don't know how to solve it.
And we always strive, as I mentioned at the beginning, to implement the decisions, meaning we are the best people to apply the decisions.
Is the issue removed from competition? Is there also competition regarding Darfur?
I don't want to get involved in this matter.
Before we end this conversation, Your Excellency, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will host the summit.
We hope that if it is held, it will be in an environment different from the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
It would be a shame
Okay, if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When the blood of Palestinians was flowing in Gaza, they are now gathering for financial and economic reasons.
Help in igniting
But it doesn't seem like anyone is afraid of this street.
You don't know about the circumstances, I mean, of course, we don't wish for anything to happen to all of us except safety.
And be safe
But I mean, no one takes anyone by the small hand.
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how truthful are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most vulnerable group to neglect in the world.
And what about our Arab region and its level of concern for this issue?
These questions and others are asked to our guest for today's episode.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability
She holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Social Work, and Sociology from Qatar University.
And also for the master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University, Egypt.
And I held many positions in the field of people with disabilities
including a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities
The year 1998
and Vice Chairman of the National Committee for People with Disabilities from 1999
Until 2003
I also contributed to the establishment of the Shafalah Center for People with Disabilities.
With people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest oversaw the launch of many programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed by giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Lady Hessa, with us in this episode.
The accepted term is "people with disabilities."
In the beginnings, we used the term "disabled" in the eighties and before.
More educational when
It falls among those who provide them with that education
At ninety-three, an important document appeared at the United Nations
Regarding this term before we delve into the details
Regarding the other regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing or are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, indeed, this trend is perhaps stronger there than in any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise
The trend towards a rights-based approach exists in the Arab world; you find it in many countries.
Maybe the resources are available and the political will is present
Well, let me tell you some statistics here, perhaps you are already aware of them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not attend school.
Lady Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
It is truly to a great extent.
I saw first in Darfur and Gaza and in the areas that are exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There is no distinction between a disabled person who is disabled or not disabled, as the numbers are large.
The illiteracy rate among children, for example, among females, is approximately thirty-five or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching schools, even if they do not have a disability.
The city originally has no infrastructure, so even if that child found that school.
that he can reach it
For the children and for other residents, it is.
Such projects and agendas are wonderful, but we don't hear much about them in reality.
Not until we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago—what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better positions than those who have no disability at all
Some organizations have arrived and established many projects.
He implements a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian issues and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Currently, in the Arab world, there is a higher level of awareness.
At the awareness point, we stop to receive calls and continue our dialogue.
Thank you
I have two questions I would like to ask her since she was previously a delegate at the United Nations.
What is the second point?
United Nations laws that call for, for example, fighting regimes that cause disability to society, such as my son, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit to challenge the regime, as there are many in Syria, I mean?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Krou, tell us from Syria. Thank you very much. With us, Nayef Al-Saeed from Kuwait. Please, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.
And peace be upon you.
Good evening
Good evening, please go ahead
I kindly ask you, I am one of those with intellectual disabilities.
It means I hear Arabs say that a free man understands by a gesture.
And in the verse in Al-Gharan, it is said: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glory be to Him who has given us speech and has given speech to everything.
It means I sat for more than thirty years, maybe I didn't speak at all, maybe a word or two a day.
So glory be to Allah, Allah has made me speak.
So he's sitting there talking loudly, and I realized, I mean
It means an attack on me for exploiting the Quran and for being a hypocrite, and for targeting people, and so on.
They are threatening me and targeting me while they are in the depths with fire.
So I only got defamation.
And they do not deceive the truth
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
and psychological disabilities, of course
It falls within this definition to question Sulaiman's inquiry regarding
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or others
Approaching various organizations and agencies
To discuss it with her, persuade her, and know to what extent.
Disability issues and topics are on their agendas in the sense of
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the reality of these organizations actually place disability
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children with disabilities.
The suitable opportunities and schools
From the various environmental aspects and aspects
Similarly, UNICEF
But there are deficiencies; we must admit that there are shortcomings in the situation at the United Nations as well.
What are the main weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned?
Regarding the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was directly present in my country, Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered
My work is particularly sometimes I saw it also during restrictions or shortcomings.
He struggles or tries and fights with people with disabilities for recognition.
Until I reached a point where I was somewhat satisfied with it, I did not put it in a separate material as the global disability movement wanted.
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part
Unfortunately, there is no formatting between them.
This is one of the most important points of her palace.
The survey conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
Within the staff or among the workers in those programs
Unfortunately, we received only three responses out of eighty-eight organizations and agencies; only three responses came to us.
Don't forget
The issue of disability as a permanent, stable, and ongoing condition for many years, despite being primarily a human rights issue.
In recent times, yes, الحمدلله, from two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has at least become a topic discussed through activities such as seminars and others.
Peace be upon you
Dear Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for activating these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Do these funds go to the governments or to offices affiliated with the United Nations? And do these aids truly reach the disabled?
And a note at the end: there were no binding decisions regarding the Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Al-Halabi, for talking to us from Greece.
My name is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Please go ahead, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you.
To adopt this proposal
It is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
He/She/It transforms into this box
He is a manufacturing plant
For one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer the callers' questions
And he says that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery but
It costs a lot and he cannot afford this process, so which direction should he turn to?
He is from Algeria
I think it is important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, meaning the rights of disabled individuals.
All these rights are his duty; this citizen must obtain them.
To join the International Convention on Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal agreement.
Satisfying the rights and needs of individuals within its national scope
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
Mandatory for all countries, with oversight to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials at the first level, there must be awareness.
So, at the very least, if we work on these covenants in this manner
Even if there is not a significant commitment
Was there a response to the reports you were monitoring, and was there any interest?
But don't forget, the standard rules are a morally binding document, not a legal one.
To be committed and to have it certified.
And understanding that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or presented within a societal context that suffers from many problems and challenges.
Naji Zakarni, Director of the Qatari Deaf Center, Sign Language Expert at Al Jazeera Channel
At the beginning, Mr. Ali extends his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera channel.
The one who kindly broadcasted this special episode now.
Now Ali is speaking and saying I am very proud
And she was a servant to all people with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
And we support her and stand by her always and forever
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them do not know this agreement because there were no training courses.
Especially her, especially if she is in schools, hospitals, or government and private institutions
It is necessary for this agreement to be published.
It is like a law that concerns people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And this is more certain and urgent that the countries should undertake
This agreement is being drafted and signed.
Similarly, countries like Qatar and some other nations have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and benefiting us.
Thank you very much, colleague Naji. Zakarna spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you both very much.
Your opinion may make a decision
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, perhaps we start with the proposal submitted by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
About the establishment of a support fund
It is a donation box and accepts contributions from any countries.
This box is supposed to be used for expenses related to activities that the special rapporteur undertakes when performing his duties.
And even the Arab countries only donated one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those obligations is a problem existing within the United Nations.
The box that
Unfortunately, the lack of commitment by member states and the lack of concern
And many unfortunately say it openly, meaning that we no longer care about the current situation.
It is indeed a matter of obligations.
About human rights
The human being in its broad general form
Marginalized, in particular
But that is why those covenants exist.
So, if these countries fulfill their obligations, but it's a good idea that the brother launched.
Additionally, it is essential that there is not only an independent box, meaning in its standalone form, but also the organizations already present in the area.
From what she has in budgets
A step towards projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for People with Disabilities
The issue always involves interference, meaning political factors intervene in it.
His state or government took on the responsibility of supporting him significantly
The number has unfortunately decreased.
For symbolic amounts
There, the father is disabled
Of course, I withdrew my nationality from him.
The girl with him withdrew; she is a girl of age
Sometimes I
Problems in Teaching
We travel or go abroad, and we get caught up in a state of confusion.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you
And peace be upon you.
And we can
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge
I hope that Arab countries allocate a portion of their budgets.
Thank you very much, Bahjat. Kuroan Bahjat from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please go ahead
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you.
Good evening to you and good evening to Lady Sheikhah Bint Khalifa
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In the past years
With our best wishes, we, the families of those with special needs
In support of Sheikha Hessa's ongoing efforts for them
A noble banner bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
There is another level, which is genetic.
I believe that genetic level care reduces the rate of disabled individuals.
In our Arab customs, it is always the cousin of the cousin of his paternal uncle's daughter, the cousin of the maternal aunt's daughter, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability. Thank you.
The comment responded to what was mentioned in the viewers' communications.
The truth is, there is, as I said, at the national level
Know that there are guidance and support programs.
It is part of the health services
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical
Within the psychiatric clinic, I believe, and also in education, the programs of the Higher Council of Education.
Special Education Department I honestly don't know if it still exists
But certainly, it is among the health services. Yes, there is support and medical services.
and Tahihili offers assistance for these cases
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed to the genetic factor—marriage between relatives. Are there campaigns?
For awareness purposes
In this field
Certainly, this is a very important and dangerous point.
And one of the matters that I and others have discussed in many words and many posts
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only targeted.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
Also regarding UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And Tunisia is confirmed
There are now mandatory early screening decisions.
And which has been implemented in many countries
All of this is on the preventive side
Do you receive such campaigns with a response?
Positivity, especially since it clashes with customs and traditions
Of course, that's its difficulty: it clashes with the societal culture.
There is an icon in the decision to be in strategies, to be in willpower that confronts that and commits.
The issue of early screening, for example, is a very important matter before marriage.
Are you asking if there are statistics about disabled people?
Especially for people with disabilities in the Arab region
Compare the Arab region with the meaning that
F and especially
With the recent events in the region
In the regions and conflict hotspots, in wars regarding wars, conflicts, and others
Every dead person encounters three disabled individuals.
The events in Lebanon and Darfur in many areas.
No, absolutely not, I am the one who matters first in this matter.
With the principles of human rights
There must be a situation, I mean, for disabled people, their programs, and their plans.
Include the agendas already present in ministries, institutions, government, and non-governmental organizations.
In situations such as wars or disturbances
Only for your speech, the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Navi Pillay
In the world, and even stranger, is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said—that the statistics are demographic.
Does this mean that disabled people are not included in the general statistics conducted for the population?
Does not always announce
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I believe it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In cooperation with the device, with the Planning Council, and with the
The council reaffirmed it as a fact with our participation as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
Put more effort into categorizing disabilities.
The needs that are assumed to be present in me
The quality of all these important details that must lead you to a conclusion
Is there a person with a disability or not?
Absolutely, but at least
Somewhat, the statistics are advancing in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, I thank you for this program and I thank Sheikha Hessa.
But I thank and praise Allah that I am Qatari and I receive this attention from my country, I mean
And my daughter is currently a student in independent schools and is receiving good education, praise be to God.
And I want to thank Mrs. Hessa
And its motivating role and its role that makes us not fear or worry about our children
And to Allah be all praise and thanks, and immense gratitude to Him and to those who support this group.
Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari, for talking to us from Qatar. We stay in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you.
My esteemed sister, the reality and the hoped-for, which we are waiting for, is for you to solve the problem of our children without nationality.
Where is the sheikh's role with our Qatari children?
I hope she answers it, she answers this question.
Peace be upon you
And I bear witness to what the State of Qatar has provided in terms of services, especially for the hearing impaired.
We had an early hearing loss detection program.
There is the Higher Council for Disabled Persons
For people with disabilities regardless of the type of disability
including the Civil Society Association MG Os or other communities
Because the reality and the expected, if I compare over five years
What has been provided to the disabled five years ago and now
Thank you very much, Kareem Nasim, for talking to us from Jordan, and I return to our guest.
Of course, the
The community as a whole, especially the families that have it
Children with disabilities have big ambitions and high expectations from everyone
Whether at the planning level or at the executive level
But regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is very important.
Children who do not have documents or others, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international agreement as well as many international documents
and commitment to translating it into plans and strategies
that these services are provided automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or nationality
Okay, Sheikha Hessa, I mean I worked as a special rapporteur before, I was at the United Nations dealing with disability after six years of work.
You were wishing
Maybe time didn't favor you, maybe financial aid wasn't enough.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through the existing organizations currently, and through government institutions in many countries
I especially focus on the Arab region.
There should be more research and larger studies
We started with a global survey that produced more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously and actively worked on.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the same people are the persons with disabilities and their organizations, because they are the ones
But they have a duty that must be fulfilled.
to struggle for him
Thank you very much
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who participated with their opinion and comments.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Stay with us through your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with Until Next Time
Good morning
I am very happy to have you with us.
First, before we start and ask different questions and chat this morning
Thank you, Shaimaa. Maybe I congratulated myself.
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement
Qatar has currently put us on the world map.
Thank you, Qatar
Also, please go ahead, Ali.
First of all, good morning to the brothers and viewers
And I say congratulations on the hosting and to the entire Qatari people
And God willing, just as Sheikh Muhammad said.
Before the dream, and now, God willing, it will become a reality and work will start from today or from the announcement period.
You expected Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
Despite having strong files like America, Japan, Australia, I was not worried in this field, specifically in this matter.
No, look, I mean, honestly with you, seventy percent of the time I don't understand.
Our file is very much.
The view of the plans is truly world-class and competitive.
We are the ones, meaning we were equal to the competition.
Why are we afraid
But الحمدلله, Qatar's file was really strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 file, the World Cup, and its hosting in Qatar
What about the mathematicians themselves?
It means to them in this field, surely the joy will be very, very great, God willing.
I mean, I like it this way. We used to talk before the wind, but I wanted to hear about the wind this way.
At the moment of the announcement
Where were you? How did you welcome the joy? How was the shock? I don't know, tell me, tell me. You speak to us and speak to the viewers.
F the radio
All the world is against us.
Here is the announcement.
How did you see the global media?
Look at the overall sports channels; no one insisted, especially in Arab countries. Thank God, everyone supported Adam.
Just an announcement that Qatar's victory is a right for it to host.
All Arab countries, and it's not surprising that this generous gesture comes from them, is that they announced they are ready to offer Qatar whatever it needs.
Officially, from human resources, possible as future volunteers.
Even at the level of external media, Shaimaa
So I went to celebrate with bad luck.
Include them among those they included. The French news agency also took pictures.
We also have meetings
So no one insisted at all, Qatar has become now, let me start with you, you mention it daily.
Hundreds of times a day from the smallest spot on Earth to the largest spot on Earth
I, I expect everyone will know Qatar, those who don't know Qatar through football, it's now on the internet.
Owner of the 2022 World Cup
Any football player dreams of serving their country, of being part of the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league or not, wishes to represent the national team.
So this means it's a positive thing for someone to sacrifice themselves even in matches.
Even if his hand is injured, even if he makes it and joins the national team, he will put everything he has.
Whether in practice or in matches, since the national team logo is on his chest, he must put in everything he has.
By God, in my opinion, the officials didn't fall short, especially in caring for the young players. This means they are teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Eating, sleeping, and...
Tell me about your experience. You played in several different stages over the years, so how was your experience and where is the most important for you?
It was, of course, by God.
I was included in the stages of the national team from the youth to the first team.
You know, camps with the clubs, with the club, with the national team
Every stage has its own special character
Yes, Lana, Mashallah, I mean you used to move from this to that.
We are now used to you because of the sports.
Whenever I see you like this, Riyadh, we want to get information from you and know the sports news through Lana. So, what's the sports news with you?
I honestly don't see it much, I prefer variety. I mean, in variety shows, we used to host stars in their fields, and we also host stars in sports.
Like Ali and others as well in their sports field
On the contrary, sports activity
What about us? We were the capital of sports.
Qatar and Hala, we have become the capital of sports and world football
Instead of when you are in variety shows, you present social, economic, and cultural programs.
You have different fields: volleyball, basketball, various championships.
But then sports
Excellent sweet
I wished for a fight.
I wish I weren't twenty-five now; I wish I were ten years old.
I believe that the youth players got a chance and a great opportunity.
And they hold it, meaning as they say, with their hands and...
Sweet, on what, God willing, the word I want to address to the players who
God willing, the young juniors who will have a bright future, God willing, in the coming days, with His permission.
Of course, I think this is an opportunity and they should take advantage of it.
And it means this opportunity came on a golden platter, they say.
So they must exploit B extensively.
What's new with you? How are you? What's the latest? As for the programs I will present, I know we've been a bit busy with the vacation.
So tell us about your latest news, God willing.
Always in touch with the event, God willing, we will attend again for the Asian Cup in one month from now.
We finished just two days ago, the Gulf Cup, by the way, congratulations to the Kuwaiti team.
The news publication is also available, meaning with intuition, we are keeping up with intuition.
Sure, I am definitely involved. By the way, Qatar TV means that the first appearance for viewers was through the Qatari screen.
I did not attempt to deny this favor at all.
Wow, God willing, they transmit the media message across various channels.
Whether they are private channels, sports channels, or other channels
May God grant you health, Qatar Television
We definitely wish you, God willing, always success, and we are still on this matter.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And the fans of Al-Wakrah Club are from whom
My childhood when I was in Al-Wakra
The sheikh was with us yesterday; Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club
I am still the son of the Wokra and the son of the Wokra
Just like I told you before, this professionalism.
It concerns every individual on Qatari land
Youth, we already know that young people love sports and are addicted just like you.
How do we make a sports champion enter the social arena?
Media awareness primarily means that the media has a very important role in promoting sports across various magazines. Let's talk about life.
You have a youth addiction, but now sports have started to enter schools, and sports awareness is being introduced in schools.
You have occasions where they celebrate; any sports event they hold celebrations for.
You have the Qatari street, meaning we see the signs in the streets, which also count as sports awareness.
The female element, when it specializes, for example, in the stands or anywhere else.
This is also a women's awareness campaign or let's call it a sports campaign for female participation in the sports field.
Then we now have a Qatar national team for women players.
I imagine that sports, الحمدلله, have started to expand.
And I also expect because of the time period
To carry out many projects and raise greater awareness about the topic of sports, and I think this period is enough.
If you study correctly and work properly
Hey, enough already, and I swear we need to take advantage properly, just like them.
Then, in Noota, I wanted to take advantage of how the younger generations can benefit from the national team.
It means capabilities, expertise, devices, everything is available.
Also, an important thing is that, thank God, in Qatar, this is well known among Gulf and Arab communities that they love sports very much.
How do I attract this audience to consistently follow sports news about the matches happening in Qatar?
And the presence at the same time
But most of the Qatari street loves sports, loves football, but the problem is attendance.
It means that if you enter forums, you'll find that the interest is very high, especially in some club forums or most of the clubs.
Great interest in football and the league
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution you think could attract you? That you attend, that you stay away, that you are a referee, that you stay away, that you are a player.
What is the way they can attend the matches your friends and your quarter follow?
He depends on the person himself, not in a general sense or anything.
Some of them like to watch it on TV or gather in gatherings.
For example, Japan, Japan, made a big plan to attract a larger audience to attend.
When you attend the matches and collect points, I don't know what it means. They are trying to find solutions now, so hopefully.
and the Arab
The most important point is that every player will be present, God willing, in Qatar, especially in the 2022 file. What do you think we need?
Besides material support, what do you think is really the most important thing we actually need?
Providing the means that can be prepared for the generation to truly deserve the name of the Qatari national team and participate in the World Cup.
When he told me the time, I started to get anxious about when it would end. I kept thinking, when, God willing, will it be over? I want to finish quickly and be with the nice people.
I achieved the impossible and realized the dream we thought was impossible, but thank God, we are now living in reality.
Just like Sheikh Muhammad, these are the moments of celebration, but work has begun.
God willing, in 2022, an event worthy of Qatar's name will happen.
Congratulations to everyone in Qatar, and I honestly say that Qatar has now become a landmark of the world.
Hosting in 2022
And thanks to the elegant media personality Lana Al-Aadi. We wish you all the best, God willing, and I will always follow you so we can benefit from the exercise.
Thank you very much, surely happiness is in the eyes of the Emir.
Qatari young talents
And they are sitting and singing a new style of songs that has appeared during this period.
But in the form of a quick rhythm and beat.
And also his sect from his love for rap, God willing.
Stay with us, viewers, and our journey begins from this moment. Good morning.
We are trying to take a few looks at it.
In short, we can define rap as fast vocal music.
Its performer repeats rhythmically, not singing, a fast rhythmic pattern of the song's words.
Consisting of a large number of rhymes, it addresses a variety of topics and different issues.
and which can sometimes be personal
A political emotional meeting
and are often controversial
and largely liberated
And the rapper performer, our viewers, does not sing the lyrics of the song.
But he repeats it
And he summarizes in his voice, considering it a secondary factor.
Generally, the voice is not important in rap songs.
And for this reason, he is not called a singer but a rapper or a rap artist.
And the rapper is concerned with the following racism in the songs
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, for example, or casting.
O Allah, follow their followers, their audience, and their lovers.
They have a style that's specific to rap.
And I expect they will give you a better and bigger idea than I personally have.
Good morning, hello
By God, first of all, I mean, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
We are distinguished by something
So why don't we rap?
Then rap is an art form present in all countries of the world.
So why isn't he in Tahr?
So we said, should we invent something new?
It means we give him an idea, like a message.
Here we talk about the negatives and positives that happen in our society.
It means we deliver a message through it, and secondly, it means she is a shroud.
This is a form of art among various arts, and by the way, perhaps this information for the viewer has addressed many social and psychological problems among youth significantly.
Every time I expect it to change, and this changes with the passage of time, I expect.
By God, it was a bit weaker than usual.
We sang from 2005 onwards; the progress was almost weak at the beginning.
We say about ourselves that it is our new beginning in 2010
In more acceptance and popularity
She likes to try singing and perform in the same rap style during this period; I noticed this.
Yeah, definitely a large percentage of people.
Also, in his work, we want to talk about it; he established several teams.
Beautiful band, you guys have had so many concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded and what is the idea that one can really make a difference, and how many of you are there in this group?
By God, initially, we mean before the band was established.
The rap reached Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
It means that everyone who loves the idea of rap, he would sing rap, he would sing and upload it to the website.
I, Salman, am descending; فلان is descending; and then there was a competition.
And we got to know some people
So it means we started competing with each other.
Then, after a period of time, I mean after all these years, we reached 2010.
In 2010, there was a group system, meaning this was a group on its own, with three or four people together.
So, we said, why not unify everything under one group called Rappers TTR?
He is also a rapper.
So we agreed on this thing, it's settled. I mean, we said it in one voice; we are all one hand together.
And we went out, meaning we represented, meaning this thing, and we say this idea itself.
Approximately twenty-five and one
Twenty-five and a lot, mashallah, a large group
Okay, is there anyone playing, or is everyone just performing rap songs?
And he is the one who arranges and the one who composes.
So you can say something personal.
How are these numbers arranged in the group? Excellent. How are the twenty-five arranged?
He is each one, meaning he has his own capabilities.
That means each person in the band can make a complete song.
Without consulting any other person
But there might be differences in competencies, for example, like Salman being better than me.
He hears her and tells me no, just correct the words here, nothing else.
Maybe everyone can adjust for the other
Let's help a little.
Until there is actually an official entity adopting these works or even a company, for example, backing them.
And there will be proper distributors in it
So that the work appears in a classy style, meaning elegant, and it truly becomes something official for you.
Honestly, we really hope for support, I mean, we wish for support so that they tell us, "Tina, a company is building, and they tell us, 'Come on, we will release and produce an album for you.'"
We don't have any problem, I mean.
Some things are a bit difficult
So why don't you consider it as your first initiative?
Until one just gets to know the first CD
This way, you can later attract partners for your partnership.
In 2007, I almost made a CD.
I distributed it, I swear, among the youth.
How was the turnout?
By God
Half a text because 2007 maybe a little bit of rap art, I can't really continue strongly in the Gulf
But not strongly right now
We were just chatting casually without going outside, I mean, for example, you hear a group of guys between Valencia and Kiaso, for example.
Let's talk about it.
They told us we're organizing a party for you.
And it means covering all the costs and procedures, and coordination means, and work means, honestly, we didn't expect it to be at this level.
It means we really exploded, and it was an awesome job.
There was just a bit of pressure, I mean there were no advertisements, there was nothing at the party.
There were no announcements, there was nothing, I mean, before the party, two days ago.
So we said, I mean, no one was interested, I mean, a party two days before the announcement, no one was interested.
F Al and we're inside, I mean before the party starts
So this means a point in our favor, this one.
So, it means our voice reaches the families, not the youth.
Our view is that, I mean, we expected that this idea is just a right among the youth.
So, we discovered at this stage that there is, I mean, a category, I mean, more than one category, that listens to us.
In a certain song, there was great interaction with the audience and the band.
Most of the songs had interaction.
No, most of the songs were because there were many songs and we were a large number.
It means the group, almost the entire group.
What are these words, how do I treat different issues
We are talking about the situation we are in, but the situation we are in is very urgent.
At least a little, even if it's the most.
Even if they spoke before, I wouldn't be the one.
It turns out you need to go up the random sentences.
It means the rhyme comes out.
We think about نقد (criticism) and write this, so writing this word is better.
Okay, so we have a song here. Let's see it.
One of the songs I made.
And we follow it and also see the audience's opinion on this topic
And God willing, they also enjoy such words.
Thank you for the lovely introduction because it contains the name of my program.
With you, KD and DJ Master Bobo on the Sabah Al Doha program
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
This KG Mr. Bobo and SKT One Hot To Bree
And don't forget, the program airs at nine thirty in the morning, meaning every one is sitting in front of the TV.
With us in the preparation is Hassan Naaama, with us in the presentation is Shima Al-Hamadi
With us in directing is Nasser Al-Maliki, the episode's guests are Qatar rappers, for sure.
Because it actually contains the name Al Al, thank you, guys. Keep up the good work.
I am just clapping for you, and truly, the youth are above in the control room.
It was recorded last night.
And who wrote the words in you or who
Everyone writes their words by themselves
Because if I had come, I would have written words of truth for Yousef
He only writes these words: I love singing, I love emotion.
I think you should write in the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup. I think you might participate in them, right or not?
We are definitely, I mean, we are definitely releasing a song, so regarding this matter.
It's just that it should be somewhat formal or a bit more refined.
So I think there must be Qatari songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of what is called rap art, yes.
Yes, I think that today everyone is waiting for
We are currently broadcasting live on air.
And of course, this cup arrived and decorated the streets of Doha.
As our viewers, as we saw, Doha is preparing to welcome the Asian Cup
And the relevant devices have completed all arrangements to be received.
The cup, and it is definitely expected that there will be a larger crowd than what we have seen.
I think the Corniche is about the same length from the beginning to the end.
Certainly, they are the most important in welcoming this important sporting event.
In upcoming parties, God willing, I will follow them in the coming days, God willing.
Someone from a certain place came to us and said we will organize a party for you.
But so far, things are a bit complicated.
The procedures and this is not certain.
So I try to say, for example, I saw Youssef and I saw فلان.
I saw several people, I want them. I have a song topic, and I saw the three of them.
Suitable for the song
And the possibility that we can enrich it
That I am sitting at home
Then send it to Yusuf via email on the internet.
You, Youssef, this part of the song
Also, they travel abroad.
They are entering this field and have gained millions of fans.
We don't try to imitate, but one hears what is better.
But Ikoon means a strong competitor with his style.
So what prevents me from taking ideas from them to imitate them in certain things
Just reverse it, I mean take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song. I do it differently.
They worked hard, a special division was formed, and they now have more than one CD with people.
Tell about a person named Abdullah Al-Dail
He has experience and the ability to discover underground water.
and it lies in their ability to detect underground water sources
One resident of Marat city
There are many experienced people.
To determine water locations before drilling wells
And he may need to or may drill many wells, but there is no water.
Using copper bars or pomegranate branches
And the fig is used to indicate the locations of water sources.
What tools does he use?
The pain, the pain, the discoverer of groundwater
This is old.
But now it has been replaced with copper rods.
Now place the two rods parallel to each other.
And now we walk at a slow, light pace.
We observe when we pass over a watercourse
Because the shutters will open
Now, now we are passing, now in this way, now we are passing over a water stream.
It has now opened up like this.
When we pass, it begins now
This is now in the middle of the water stream
And and the from here, it becomes the middle.
In this way, we can now determine the width of the watercourse or the water channel beneath the ground surface.
And of course, the process is repeated multiple times on various sites until we find the strongest one.
Abu Ibrahim affirms
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession
To make his discoveries very precise
In Marat's area and outside Marat's area, in Shuqra, in Ahremlah, and in Athithia.
More than 150 wells have been discovered.
The error rate was five percent, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from Allah, the Most High.
Superior to modern devices and laboratories
In a very short period of time
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid
For the صباح الدوحه program
Marat City, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We followed this report and we promise you, God willing, more reports from Arab and international countries.
And Gulf-style, God willing
We have now reached with you, viewers, various headlines and titles, but they have their meaning.
The Great and First Title and Waf
I expect there is a large group of young Gulf nationals in the Gulf itself.
There are certain people you should look up to.
But I mean, for example, I'm not copying them, but you feel that it's necessary to follow their work first, then I'll talk.
By God, they are the Gulf rappers, generally speaking, there is a connection between them.
F means not a competitor, competitions, I mean, I released a song.
And I talk about the topic
It means to be a competition, as you say, purposeful.
There is a connection between us, and it means only a specific one.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai is really impressive, creating a great atmosphere.
He became very popular and got a CD, and he gained his audience.
He has more than one company that could adopt him.
You wish to reach this stage, but perhaps you will surpass this stage more and more, God willing.
God willing, we wish you all success, by God's permission, through this team.
Of course, this important sports cup, the Asian Cup, is present and being received. Let's see the clips available on the Corniche.
And in addition to a group of Qatari youth
Whoever moves, whether from the West, but in a Gulf style.
Also, emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished band of twenty-five people
It's necessary for one to follow your news first thing.
So I guess you must have an email, a specific website on the internet, or a forum.
So how can someone reach you?
By God, some time ago we had a website dedicated to us.
But there are a few problems with the company, the recruitment company.
He would sometimes get drunk, sometimes not know what.
So we faced problems with it and in the end, we just closed it.
So, basically, the site is definitely closed, closed.
Okay, and what is the current alternative until this problem is solved because of the difference?
In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even in Morocco or Egypt
One must stay in touch with you, know your news, and see the songs you produce from time to time.
Faysh is the alternative now
Currently, the alternative relies on private pages, for example.
Exactly what is the name?
He is lying in the Google search engine.
Bassem Rap Qatar or Rappers Qatar
You make videos even alone.
You worked on the program yesterday.
We uploaded more than one video on YouTube
Song and pictures
Song and the same style as a video but I record behind the scenes.
I think we need to see more development from you.
You need a place to gather, and each one should have their own device at home.
and the mixer, the computer, the piano, and the guitar
Honestly, I wish we could get some support.
For example, a company, meaning
We produce a CD for you
I'll make a special place for you.
From ourselves
But in the end, we remain, I mean, it's a personal matter.
We don't want it to be considered personal work.
By God, my words are no different from Yusuf's words
Music video, we need a music video
And the album pain
And the spreading power with B B in the video clip I think is very important
Because it delivers the information more effectively
If support is available, everything is with him.
Your beautiful voices reach everywhere
It is considered one of the different arts that address problems and resolve issues.
Thank you to Youssef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Al-Abdullah for being with us.
Let's see it and I wish them, of course, all the success. On behalf of our program, Good Luck for the youth.
These projects were indeed good.
In the project, also, it's almost ready but needs some technical development.
Expiration date, price
You have the cashier's receipt. You have the total, all the details, and it's ready.
And to identify the product instead of holding each part and examining the components and their damages.
And he is walking in the trolley
It is more complicated itself, so one can choose the material they want with more precision.
Of course, most of the projects are a reflection of the child's feeling of having a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center now means a set of programs it designs, and the activities are based on a main idea.
So we have ten objectives that Her Highness Sheikha Moza set during the establishment of the center.
Maybe, maybe also
He goes directly down into the ground, moves underground, and goes down to the train beneath the ground from his house.
But her main idea is that it's clothing
Show me all the stores in Qatar that have black T-shirts.
There is also a house key and a car key with me; I have a button to press.
It comes out for me if I get it, I lost it, it takes me to the key that
Yes, we will return once again to the projects that you will undertake, God willing, through the Cultural Center.
The importance of early childhood education
Developing his skills and nurturing talented individuals
So we move between a set of children's skills, whether it is media-related or research-related.
If the skills of personal communication in public speaking are about convincing the audience
With all these skills, we create a special program tailored to serve them.
We started with the indicators of the future and achieved a great accomplishment. Now we have reached the graduation projects and their completion.
We also reached a large number of young child speakers.
and their creativity
You have such young announcers as well.
Returning to television means and it's necessary for them to produce programs for children.
We are sitting, we are watching TV.
through their television, Qatar Television
They haven't had it until now, so we have been with them for eighteen years.
Hello and welcome to them wherever they are, yes
This also means the national television.
And our need to attract, acquire, discover, and develop these talents
From informative to research-based
To the private matters of thinking
To reading, to many diverse fields
In this way, you cooperate with each other to exchange ideas.
In every field, for example, the FiKhat Al-Wa'd program with the Ministry of Awqaf.
Al Al Ma'radna Ma'rad Al-Ajlal Hatha Aydan
The Scientific Club played a major role in developing projects and also in providing technical support for these projects.
The greatest role also belongs to the Higher Education Council and their support for schools and their partnership.
Professor Abdullah, your transfer to Katara, this great edifice
which also gathers a large group of wonderful activities and events
Is this considered a push forward for the imam of the same center?
Except that you take a building like this separately
Far from this great edifice
And it gave us an interface to deal with the public more easily, I mean.
and pioneering projects as well as good ones
And in many cases, welcoming guests and introducing them to the nature of the programs that offer cultural programs provided for children.
Because our main project during these three years
It is the national project for developing reading skills among children.
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with support, which is very significant.
This is a main project which is the development of reading and writing children's stories to enhance their skills.
The different cultures that are related to reading in particular
There are, of course, many programs.
So now we have recently moved.
And now he means reorganizing some activities.
And its design and development to suit the nature of the visitors, meaning Katara
We definitely wish you all the best of luck, God willing, through this center.
The one that gathers very important ideas within it
Of course, the first thing is to thank you for this generous hospitality.
The most important thing, honestly, is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children
It means today's children are different from yesterday's children; their childhood is not our childhood.
They need us to give more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough attention and listening for his interest and imagination.
And I communicate with him intellectually
They work, meaning their way of dealing with the children is like a hotel that provides them with accommodation.
It is a bank that provides him with money.
He is someone whose child lacks someone to listen to these ideas, to listen to this imagination.
And we are currently living through the transfer, now during the difficult days, they transferred us to twenty thirty.
Through this exhibition
We wish success, God willing, to the projects that have won awards.
And thank you for your presence with us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, God willing.
So that these projects actually come true and exist in reality, and are not just a constant dream.
Welcome, viewers. The Cultural Center for Childhood concluded on the evening of the day before yesterday, Monday, at the Diplomatic Club.
National Exhibition of Generations' Dreams under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Realities of the Nation, Future of Tomorrow"
organized on the occasion of the country's National Day with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar
The exhibition showcased diverse activities and various competitions to our viewers.
and innovative projects for children
We are generally pleased to host you on behalf of our viewers, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, may God bless you, my dear sister.
Thank you at the beginning for giving the center the opportunity.
Talking about this distinguished exhibition is truly a pleasure.
We are also pleased with your presence through the program so that we can cover as much as possible of all the events that took place during this exhibition.
This national exhibition of the dreams of generations
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, of course, this is the exhibition.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood
National Day celebrations
And he had a stance, of course, very much so; he had a very important touch with every child.
To empower children
He lives with a dream
and with the project
This project or the dream
Children's dreams are vast
Its fields are broad; we have defined them within a framework of twenty to thirty meters in diameter.
and other main areas of Qatar Vision 2030
So we started training children in four stages
And what are the mechanisms of brainstorming and a set of tools for expanding the child's thinking?
What do you mean by this sentence specifically?
These are the facts of the homeland of tomorrow
In other words, what our children dream of today
That this project and grows with this project
This was actually a interpretation of this vision—that children begin to live from this day forward.
With a big dream
Whether in the environmental field or in fields such as health, human development, and others.
that serve the homeland
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place
or in a specific exhibition
So, was all of this available through?
The exhibition featured distinguished guests.
Honored guests are the ones from whom children learn as role models
Yesterday, the Arab fall was two or three weeks ago
There were also winners in various awards in the Arab world.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are definitely proof of your statement, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were taken at the exhibition and various events.
This is also the owner of the last project, the owner of the forest.
The innovative or creative
This is one of the children's inventions, Mashallah. I mean, a very beautiful idea that we can share with the viewers.
And we tell it a little, what exactly is this colorful ball thing?
Then approximately four or five projects came about this topic, one of which was the colored ball.
O Ismena also the smart stadium
This ball if it goes outside the field
It varies, its color changes.
We will return, I think, to matches more significantly in the future, God willing.
Okay, so what comes after these dreams?
It also relates to a need, meaning it concerns his interests.
And I expect that especially when there are officials, they take into account these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects actually serve us. Well, the President of the Football Federation here in Qatar.
What is our opinion of the idea of the colored ball?
Do you like the idea?
Certainly, the cost of his visit, of course, and he reviewed the projects related to football.
A serious pause, and these projects are adopted at that moment.
He is very prominent in the field at the moment and undertakes these projects.
The audience also voiced support for a large number of projects presented by our children.
And our loved ones, so what projects could we say were highlighted more prominently and voted on?
Of course, we have a evaluation method in the evaluation committee that has a main evaluation method.
These projects are the ones that won the awards: the first, second, and third projects.
It was from the forest and won the first prize.
He has very detailed information about the project, and the project was ready to start.
It means, of course, an administrative side, requiring many administrative aspects.
I delved into many very detailed aspects and also distributed visitor brochures, as if it was ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures we are currently seeing.
This is a collection, yes. This is also a collection of many projects I participated in.
Maybe they feel like that, meaning they are not just sitting and watching movies or cartoons.
It is not actually linked; some of it may come true, adopted by institutions.
For example, we give project names. What are these projects?
How can this excess be utilized at home? How to manage, collect, and reuse it?
Two hundred forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated this year the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third cohort.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and members of the teaching staff
And today the university celebrates the graduation of seventy-seven students.
Of course, we thank colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid, and we will stay in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, a dear guest will be with us.
From a family of a series of works by artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharshani
And he confirmed his participation with many works, including the series "Qulub lil-Iijar" (Hearts for Rent).
And they struggled to prove themselves in the artistic arena
Especially since the field of art does not know flattery
which means
Hello and welcome, good morning, and I love to greet the viewers.
On the contrary, the program is really good, honestly.
I will see something very simple from one of your works and start a conversation with you.
You're joking with me
Take the fake bisht and bring the original
Go and bring it.
The Beshṭ is available
Bring back the Beshteh, how do I return it?
Damn, I ground him in her belly. Damn her father.
I am a member of a committee composed of five members.
In the Supreme Committee of the Conference
I'm not agreeing with you
I have no objection
This is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series "Tasaneef," which we will see in the second part.
We ask you about your participation this year in Part Two
Tell us a little about your roles in the series, which is a series of genres, each episode having a different topic.
What does your participation tell us about her?
Of course, after that
It has passed many times since that era.
And Marat is also famous for the mountain.
The one whom poets have long celebrated throughout time
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities
and it points to the authenticity of its past
which is 170 kilometers north of the capital Riyadh
And it is said that his lineage is attributed to Amr ibn Qais al-Tamimi
It was distinguished by its effects, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
Poets sang about it, became enamored with it, and its fame is linked to its well-known mountain, Kameet.
It is said to be Ghadir Kumayt
Of course, the city is a city of women, a city that hits the foot.
And Islam's appearance has preceded.
There were old objects whose dates are unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
which we are currently in now
The noble Companion of the Prophet, Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, ordered the digging of this well during his campaign against the apostates.
And I have remained until today
The saying goes: "Guarantee me my sleep, I’ll guarantee you my wife."
So when you see a kameet, you see many times.
Of course, another effect is also Ghadir Kumayt.
The one from which the waters of sweetness have flowed over the years
which was enough for the city for a whole year
From the beginning of the rainfall until the next rainy season
This artifact is also ongoing; its date of creation is unknown.
There is also the bride and there is
Jabal Kameet is one of the landmarks of Marat city.
And this mountain is said to have many proverbs, poems, and verses.
He comes to him from all parts of the kingdom
One of its most prominent works is the Waliidi Well
And it was that he descended during the times of the Wars of Ridda, and he was heading towards Al-Yamama.
So he camped there and ordered men to dig this well.
The one whose water is still being drawn from and from which they perform ablutions.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldan that Khalid passed by Marat.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original condition.
It contains many sections that highlight the architectural character of the region and its renowned heritage and monuments.
The one about whom the poet said, "When we reached the water, the water was his."
Ghadir Kummit, not Ghadir Al-Anjal
Professor Ayman, also, Mashallah, there is cooperation between the family, the guardian, and the child's guardian with this center and also with the child.
And I expect there are different ways that he might be with you firsthand.
For the general management of the training operation
That is, from the moment the trainee, student, or child arrives, Tifar.
This file will contain your complete personal data.
Until his grades are all monthly, meaning he has a monthly report card, for example, we...
It means our program is very good.
Every four lectures, there is a presentation.
Through a username and password, the guardian can
We give it to him so he can access it
Yes, it shows his level of progress from the beginning of his enrollment in this center up to today.
Yes, we have several different models, I will follow up on them.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, he will surely honor us later.
We are going to see various models like this. I wish we had more space.
But we brought a model of a child.
There will be more tests in front of you live on air.
We ask her questions in mathematics and various other questions
We will take a short break and continue with you, and then we will see this smart girl. Stay with us.
The artist's management made the audience smarter now.
It means any work, any effort, from the first two or three times, the work didn't succeed, just press the remote.
He won't tire himself out; he has twenty thousand other series.
Exactly twenty thousand series, this is correct
The series of the Sunnah means, and some people say that one should focus on one act.
He can see the second works he puts.
Yes, that's right.
I'll tell you, I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome your presence with us, a generous and dear guest, Abdulaziz Al-Sharshani.
I want to say a word to your viewers, your audience, of course, those who love you. I am definitely from your audience.
A word has been directed to us
I tell them, "Happy New Year."
That's right, we don't go out much, we don't go out a lot, we don't act a lot, of course I mentioned the reasons myself.
The future is better
God willing, we wish you success in this year's endeavors.
God willing, there will be a second meeting for us to talk about these plays.
Everything is interconnected.
And since fashion shows have begun to attract many people and are eagerly awaited by enthusiasts of new styles
We welcome you, dear viewers, through Sabah Al Doha, and we are with you via Al Hawa.
Today, we are definitely talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of male and female students, as well as our children, who have joined this center.
This center offers a wide range of different sciences.
Certainly, their focus is on developing various skills.
And also, their minds are 100% active, God willing.
Professor, of course, Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khogel, who is the Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning
May God bless you
And with us, the beautiful Amna, Amna, good morning
Good morning
How old are you, my love?
Sofan Qrayd Sofan
Masha Allah, we wish you all the best.
What are the things you offer to our sons and daughters?
It was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically a program that benefits children, our children.
And it is a program of minds for mental mathematics
Through the funnels and through the abacs
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to clarify a small part of them.
I felt, Professor, I felt, Professor Ibrahim, that there is indeed a difference. Actually, the student, as soon as he enters, in the first two days
And after he spends maybe three or four months with you
If he studied in government schools, private schools, or even independent ones
Principally, the program scientifically follows specific methods.
After passing the first level of the program
Who clarifies where the abilities that the child lost or needs development in are, and how to reach them.
And has it reached a certain point or what developments have occurred with the child
So we are proceeding with a scientific approach, a scientific program
It's not just some methods or mechanisms that are applied normally
Laa in a scientific and organized manner
Before the start of the program and after completing this course or the levels he went through
Professor Ibrahim is now with us, as you can see, viewers. Amani is asking the students who joined this center.
We wanted this to happen today live so we can show our viewers the importance of this scene.
I don't mind returning the Beshteh.
So this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series "Tasaneef," which we will see the second part of.
But since we saw this clip from the first part of the classification series
Tell us a little about your roles in the series, which is a collection of episodes, each with a different topic.
The year, focus on the one who is going to leave.
Negligent, neglectful
She is urging while sitting and giving opportunities
Twelve rings in your classifications
Of course, there's a circle manager, an elder in the circle, and a baker in the circle.
means diverse solutions
Professor Ghanem Al-Sulaiti from Qatar
We have artists from Qatar
Many artists don't attend now. Of course, we have artists from Bahrain: Zahra Arafat, Ibtisam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashed and Mohamed Adel
Of course, Tara
If it weren't for Tara, the youth wouldn't have performed.
There are very few tasks; we only have two tasks per year in Qatar.
Qatar TV also produces drama works, and we can also say that.
Ghatir Television is a product presenter.
Qatar TV, of course, did a great job, but only one project a year, and all the Qatari actors want to work.
And this was the reason
It's about you, Alij, a single series, and all the Qatari artists want to work in it.
Even if a person witnesses something, he should say Alhamdulillah.
Praise be to Allah in all circumstances
Okay, let's go back to your beginnings.
I thank him very much, of course.
Consult him on this matter.
Of course, the artist Abdulaziz Jassim from the judgment of humans until another day, until after the dispersion, yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he produced his first solo production. Abdulaziz Jassim worked with us as a theater and television company.
He is the one who raised us, who taught us, and who made us.
Of course, after that, Mr. Ghanem joined us in the world talks and didn't fall short with Faiq Al-Toush Al-Fain.
Because honestly, it gave us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two jobs a year.
So we have two jobs this year, thank you thank you Tara
A killer feeling, of course, the same thing produced by Tara for Artistic Production
The director of the series is Mr. Mounir Al-Z.
We return to you, our viewers, and today the talk is about reflexive medicine.
Massage using the palm of the hand
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We had a guest with us
The examination method is as follows
Swelling, pain period
You feel inside the hand, sometimes you feel like sand, like broken veins inside the hand.
Relax your hand
Of course, our brother Sahbi is a bit nervous.
You feel a little stress and pressure.
The left side
Of course, now dear viewers, I am examining the left side of his body.
So they are in the picture
Any health problem that appears now, we know about the headache and the dizziness that comes with it.
There is pain here.
The problem means an issue
What is this problem exactly here?
The ones here are the ear pockets
Jo, Nafa, do you have a sinus operation or a previous problem?
Mus has had surgery, but it was a long time ago
What is it, my skin or something?
His weight increases without eating.
Okay, you have pain in your left shoulder.
This is nerve-wracking, one day I got so nervous that I had a nervous breakdown.
Ten years ago, I walked barefoot along the sea.
Well, we know that when someone walks on the beach, I expect they will empty their pockets.
An uneven surface, not just the sea
Negative energies might be present.
He might also be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Certainly, children are the most important people.
Children, Subhan Allah for the mother, focus with me.
She is tired of the milk and the food that he uses.
She met her child and put him to sleep; the child falls asleep automatically.
Sugar your hands
A very slight pressure, Subhan Allah
After a few seconds, you notice the child getting excited; first, he gets hurt, then he calms down a bit because of the pain here.
Then suddenly, سبحان الله, you see gases coming out.
What discoveries have you made, Professor Abdulaziz?
But less than the other problems now: joints and bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing regarding menstrual pain or period pain or menstrual cycle pain in general.
Focus on a rock or stones, or simply press here to give commands. Glory be to Allah, for lower back pain and menstrual problems, if you have the pain.
In a matter of seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
It makes childbirth easier for her
But here or here, of course, or God knows.
If they told her that, by God, it's in the seventh month of pregnancy or the ninth.
Only on sand
It means walking on sand is okay, but on rocks, no.
He breakfasted with seven dates, the best of dates.
And if he doesn't put moist dates, God willing, it will be enough.
As Allah, the Exalted, said: "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan," and my discovery of this is from the Quran, of course.
It means God couldn't make this moist date come to her, he couldn't.
O Allah, all praise is due to You, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word "I".
Sakhir responds, "Small balls."
The delivery bed is weak, for example, I forgot, she came to the delivery bed and held the iron.
And you notice that even in private hospitals, an East Asian woman comes.
Now, God willing, this is actually a tradition in East Asia.
My phone is with you, no need.
Only the mobile
It collaborates with some, I mean everyone. My advice to every creature listening to me now.
Be diligent in charity and care for others; you were created for the servants of Allah, then...
To serve the people, that's the first thing. The second thing is, I am not a religious scholar or sheikh; I am an ordinary person.
Hello Professor Abdulaziz, I thank you for this good meeting. Of course, thank you to our guest who is with us.
May you be granted a thousand good things. Hopefully, and good luck, God willing.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Department of Public Health at the Supreme Council for Health, will tell us more in detail.
Good morning, Sheikh
Let's get straight to it and take a look at these events.
The truth: A program of healthy steps towards Qatar
It is a program that is part of the national strategy for the treatment and prevention of obesity.
Four of the ten countries in the world with the highest obesity rates are from the Gulf countries.
So, we have started in the Supreme Council for Health with a strategic plan, of course, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other entities in the fight against obesity.
Afraid that it will spread more and more, Fl Fl soon
One of the programs to protect against obesity is healthy steps towards Qatar
They are working together on this competition to make it an international contest.
Of course, the program is six weeks long.
Every week is different from the next week
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age
Because they are just starting out, they mean they are doing it themselves.
So, the first week, as you remember, was about what your favorite fruit is.
Week Two Walking
It has to walk, of course. The more someone walks, the more points they earn.
It is a circle map, and every time someone collects points, they apply and step into their school, taking steps forward, meaning they step forward.
So there will be a fun competition among the students.
So, in the third week, he drinks water; he doesn't drink fizzy drinks.
So we say he gets used to drinking water; there's no need for a lot of carbonated water. Whenever he's thirsty, he drinks fizzy water. No, I don't drink water.
Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport.
Some of them have games at school; he doesn't like them.
So we're looking for a sports game that he likes.
To make him, I mean, to practice sports.
The boy eats a healthy meal
And his family knows that he needs to pay attention to his son, to feed him a healthy meal
And Al-Jazeera Academy, a boys' and girls' academy, so we can take
Of course, this is a successful sample. God willing, we will increase the experience in the coming years.
Of course, the students are happy. I don't know how they feel, but they say our activity is more.
We played more games; we enjoyed more with our colleagues.
The girls say our skin has improved, the acne has decreased.
Exactly, exactly, he becomes conscious.
Fathers know about their children
And their colleagues in the second grades say, "How are you?" I mean, and they learn from them and their colleagues and brothers.
And thank God, it is starting to spread that there are many schools excited to participate next year, of course, starting now.
God willing
Of course, the official sponsor was Qatari Telecom in supporting this.
We had Aspire Zone that organized sports competitions for students and awareness.
Al al al on the dining table, I mean
Praise be to Allah from several sources, including this one I mentioned, and some others I might have missed.
But thank God, everyone contributed a part of what they have.
Some of the brothers used to hold competitions on Saturday.
There was some variety in it.
We tried to create several types and include as many people as possible.
He is the generation of the future, meaning
So that we can generalize this experience or spread it to the largest possible extent, for example, in Qatar
So, you're evaluating for the first time, and there are some things that need to be adjusted.
So after the spread, الحمد الله now and satisfactory results.
God willing, we are publishing it because there are people now demanding and asking why we haven't included them.
You eat healthy food until you reach this point, no problem.
So at this age, when he starts from a young age, he will reach what he aims for, whether he is twenty or twenty-five years old.
You mentioned a set of titles, one for each week.
If we go back, in our paragraph today we will try to be about the conclusion of the events.
And also, if we go back to reminding people, in our program we had more than one hosting.
Let's go back, repeat, and do it every week: what were the pieces of information we wanted to convey to the students?
God willing, my sister, the first thing, of course, for example, the first week is the favorite fruit.
Of course, fruit as a whole is a portion of fruit. What are its benefits?
What is the benefit of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he himself begins to understand what he likes in fruit, not all fruits are his enemies, I mean.
So, he might develop an allergy to one or two types, but why don't the others eat them?
Week Two: Walking. People think that walking is only for young children. Why do they walk?
So when I grow up, I will walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it calms the mind and the brain.
And it relaxes the human's mind, meaning that walking improves mental clarity.
You were going to take them to walk the students
None of them are required to go anywhere, whether at school or at home.
and they record their points through the classroom schools
Because they are just a few, I mean not daily.
So there was an event where some people organized a school girls' march.
We want them to be like this, I mean, to be creative, to have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers come up with new ideas. We don't want to give them ideas so they don't go beyond them.
Everyone had their own skills in this area.
Of course, in the third week, I drink water all the time. We try to drink water constantly so he doesn't get thirsty and crave fizzy drinks.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
So if we manage to reach his favorite sport and support him in it
He gets excited about sports.
Their love for sports is that he's just playing it; he's playing sports without even realizing it.
Since we previously mentioned that we will talk about the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis Patients
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode and who brightened up the studio.
Welcome to you
Welcome to our program.
And among them, this disease is perhaps unknown to many of us.
In the beginning, as the Egyptians say, we'll get straight to the point.
This is a chronic disease
It affects the nervous system in the human body
The interval lasts from twenty to forty years.
This disease also has no cure so far, and there is no known cause for this disease or its infection.
It usually affects the active segment of society, which is the youth segment.
Treatments and uses for cancer patients, keep evil and other diseases away from you
This disease is an inflammation of the brain nerves and spinal cord nerves.
and it is the central nervous system in the human body
The body is empty because there is a nearby body inside the body.
The nerve cell is a term for
Who covers this electrical wire?
White blood cells are the first white blood cells to kill or dissolve this protective layer.
which leads to the failure of nerve signal transmission, its weakness, or disturbance
Leads to paralysis, God forbid for you.
Until now, with the development and advancement of medicine, Professor Abdulaziz, we still haven't found a cure for this disease.
Okay, besides the solution, we want to understand how it will come to us, I mean.
Also, one must have precautions regarding this matter.
It means the direct cause, which is the nature of life, the nature of food, the correlations of life.
And what exactly is the direct reason that makes a person susceptible to this disease?
Everything currently existing is just theories
Even by marriage
They try to solve the health problems faced by humans.
Yes yes
It means that all these topics perhaps somewhat provoke controversy within the community.
So far, we don't know the reasons for it.
Well, the age group that can be affected by this disease, of course, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes
Of course, the illness, after reaching forty years of age, begins to calm down with the person.
But so far we haven't found a cure for this disease.
Does this mean evidence of many people, whether in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even let's say in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar also means
I personally have been informed of three to four very serious cases just within the past week.
Currently, we have twenty-five injured recorded in the files.
And many people, when they are diagnosed with this disease, go for treatments from other countries, for example.
Okay, Professor Abdulaziz, so are there some effects that, for example, a person who has contracted this disease might experience?
Are there some signs that indicate to the affected person or to himself that I have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, started to wipe out.
Let's be honest, it's not a virus.
Because it is a nerve disease; nerves control the entire body.
We sometimes justify or give a specific reason for a certain place, like saying, "Honestly, it's the nature of the food," or "Honestly, it's the nature of the environment."
