Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child and stood him in the midst of them.
He said: "I tell you the truth: if you do not turn like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles himself and becomes like this little child, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Who accepts a little boy like this just because of my name, he accepts me.
But what might cause trouble for one of these children who believe in good for him is a large stone of a millstone around his neck, thrown into the heart of the sea.
Oh, woe to the world for the things that make people commit sins! These things are bound to happen, but woe to the person who brings about the things that make people commit sins!
And if your hand or foot prevents you from committing sins, cut it off and throw it away; for if your foot is cut off when entering eternal life, it is better for you than entering the fire forever with both your hands and feet intact.
And if your eye causes you to commit sins, gouge it out and throw it away; for it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two eyes." The Lost Sheep (Luke 15:3-7)
Be careful not to underestimate any of these children. I tell you: their angels are always in the sky, always watching over my father who is in the sky.
# 18:11 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has a flock of sheep and one of them gets lost, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go search for the lost sheep?
I tell you the truth, if he finds it, he's going to be happier with it than the ninety-nine who didn't lose it.
So, the one in the sky does not like for one of these children to be destroyed.» Forgiveness among brothers (Luke 17:3)
If your brother wrongs you, go and tell him about his mistake between you and him alone, and if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
But if he didn't listen to you, bring one or two others with you, so that every word spoken may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.
If he doesn't want to listen to their words, tell the church, and if he doesn't want to listen to the church's words, consider him as an unbeliever or a sinner.
I tell you the truth: the thing you tie to the ground to be tied in the sky, and the thing you open on the ground to be opened in the sky.
I tell you once again: if two of you agree on anything they ask for on earth, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
Where two or three gather in my name, I am in their midst.» Like the servant who does not forgive
This time, Peter came and said to Jesus: "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Seven times?"
Jesus said: "I do not tell you seven times, but seventy times seven."
That is why the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wants to settle accounts with his servants.
He is punishing them, he brought someone to ask him for money without reason.
And since he couldn't pay, Sido ordered that he, his wife, his son, and everything he owned be sold to settle his debts.
My brother, the servant, fell on his knees and said: "My master, my master, be patient with me and I will finish everything for you soon!"
And Sido insulted him, and he left him, and forgave him for the religion.
But this servant went out and found another servant asking him for some money, and he got annoyed and said: "Pay me the money I asked you for!"
My brother, the other servant fell on his knees and begged him, saying: "Be patient with me, I will pay you back."
He didn't love, he walked away and put him in prison until he pays off his debt.
The other servants discovered what happened, got very worried, and went to inform their master that everything had happened.
This time, Naddalo Sido said to him: "O wicked servant! I have forgiven you for all this debt, for your sake I forgave you."
And it's not your right to have mercy on the servant, your friend, as I have had mercy on you.
And Sido got angry, handed him over to the officer for imprisonment until he pays off all his debt.
Even so, Dad, the one in heaven will do with each of you if he doesn't forgive his brother from his heart.
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus continued speaking, he went from the Galilee region into the Judea region along the Jordan Road.
And many people followed them, and the one going saw them.
Some Pharisees came and asked him to test him: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Tell them: "Did you not read that the One who created them in the beginning created them as female and male."
# 1 Corinthians 1:27; 2:24; Ephesians 5:31; 1 Corinthians 6:16 And he said: "Is that why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife and the two become one flesh?"
So they are no longer two, but one body. That is why what God unites, man must not separate.
# Deut 24:1-4 The Pharisees asked him: "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and dismiss her?"
Jesus told them: "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But this was not the case from the beginning."
And I tell you: anyone who divorces his wife for reasons other than adultery and marries another woman is actually committing adultery.
The students said: "If this is the man's situation with his wife, it's better for him not to get married."
But he told them: "Not all people accept this speech, but the people whom God allows to accept it."
There are some people who cannot get married because they were born from their mother's womb, and there are some people whom others have done something to that they are unable to marry, and there are some who do not want to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can do this, let them do it." Jesus blesses the little children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
And they brought little children to Jesus so that He might lay His hands on them and pray for them. The disciples rebuked the people who brought them.
But Jesus said: "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he put his hand on them and went on from that place. The rich young man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
He approached one and said: "Hey teacher, what good deeds do I need to do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus said: "Why do you ask about the good things? Is there only one good? If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
# Kh 20:12-16; 1 Thess 5:16-20 They said: "Are the commandments?" And Jesus said: "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,"
# Luke 10:27 Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The boy said: "I do all these things, what else am I missing?"
Jesus said: "If you want to be complete, sell all you have and give to the poor, and then you will have a treasure in heaven. Come, follow me!"
When the boy heard this, he went away sad because he owned many things.
And Jesus said to his disciples: "I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And I tell you again: entering a camel through the eye of a needle is easier than a rich person entering the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this talk, they were very surprised and said: «So, who can pay?»
But Jesus looked at them and said to them: "This thing is impossible for people, but with God everything is possible."
Peter replied at that time: "We have left everything and followed you, what will we get?"
Jesus told them: "I tell you the truth: when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne in the other world, you also who followed me will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of the children of Israel."
And whoever leaves behind homes, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, children, or lands for the sake of my name, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
And many people at the beginning will end up at the end, and the people at the end will end up at the beginning.
Like the servants of the grapevine
The path of the kingdom of the heavens is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to put his servants in his vineyard.
And he agreed with the servants on a silver tray during the day and sent them to the grapevine.
And he went out with the nine, my brother, he saw other people standing in the market and being lazy.
And he told them: "You also go to the grapevine, and I will give you your rights, so they left."
He went out again around noon, and again at three in the afternoon, and did the same thing.
And he went out around five in the evening, and he found other people sitting, and he said to them: "Why are you sitting here idle all day?"
He told them: "Not a single one of us called to work." He said to them: "You too, go work in the grape harvest."
In the evening, the grape master said to the one who is not busy with the servants: Call the servants and pay them, start with the others until you reach the chief.
And the group that started working with the five in the evening arrived, and each of them took a silver coin.
And when the officials arrived, they thought they would take more than others, but each of them took a silver coin.
And when they get paid, they get angry at the grape owner.
And they said: "Those others only worked for an hour, and you paid them like us who worked all day in the heat!"
One of them replied: "My friend, I haven't wronged you. Didn't you agree with me on a silver coin?"
Take your right and go. I wanted to give this other person just as I give you.
My brother, don't I have the right to manage my money as I wish? Or are you jealous because I am generous?
And Jesus said: "The first will be last, and the last will be first." Jesus tells again about His death and resurrection (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34).
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them on the way:
We are going up to Jerusalem, and I, the Son of Man, will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes of the Jews, and they will condemn me to death.
And they will hand me over to other peoples, so they can mock me, beat me with a whip, and crucify me, and I will rise on the third day." The request of Mother James and John (Mark 10:35-45)
And Mabaid came to him once, with her children, and she prostrated herself before him and asked him for something.
And Jesus said to her: "What do you want?" She said to him: "I command that my two children sit, one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
But Jesus replied: "You don't really know what you're asking for. Do you think you can drink from the cup I am going to drink from?" They said: "We can!"
He told them: "You will drink my cup, but I am not the one deciding who will sit on my right and on my left. It is my father who prepared people for that place."
And when the ten other students heard about this, they got angry at the two brothers.
But Jesus called them and said: "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors,
But you must not have that thing between you. But whoever wants to be great among you, let him be your servant.
Whoever wants to become the first among you, let him become a servant to all people.
Even I, the Son of Man, did not come so that people would serve me, but to serve them and give my life as a ransom for many.» Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
And when Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
There are two blind men sitting by the side of the road, and they heard Jesus passing by. Then they started shouting: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
My brothers, people shouted at them to be quiet. But they shouted even more: "O our Lord, O son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood still and called them and said to them: "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said: "Our Lord, we want to go back and see!"
And Jesus had compassion on them and opened their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed Him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As Jesus and His disciples approached Jerusalem and reached the village of Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, at that time Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them: "Go to the village opposite you, and you will find a tied animal with a foal. Loosen the tie and bring them to me."
And if anyone tells you something, answer them: "The Lord will take care of it." And He will bring them back in time.
This thing happened so that what the Prophet said would come true:
Say to the daughter of Zion: Behold, your king comes to you, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.
The two students went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They brought the beast and the colt and laid them on their backs, and Jesus rode on them.
And most people spread their carpets in the road, while others cut branches from trees and placed them on the road.
# Psalm 118:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39 and the people who went before and those who followed, they shouted: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
And the people said: "This is Jesus the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drives out the merchants from the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out those who were selling and buying in the middle of the temple, overturning the tables of those who exchanged money and the chairs of those selling in the bathroom.
# Isa 56:7; 7:11 And He said to them: "It is written in the Holy Book: My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have turned it into a den of thieves!"
And the blind and the deaf faced the structure, and it was their refuge.
But the heads of the magicians and the scribes of the Jews were amazed when they saw the miracles Jesus performed and how the little children were calling out in the temple: "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
Mark 8:2 And they said to him, "Brother, do you hear what they are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes, indeed, have you never read this verse: 'Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he stayed overnight. Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And when he was returning to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry
And he saw a vine on the side of the road, brother, she was carrying it, and he found nothing in it but leaves, and he said to her: "You will never bring the harvest forever!" And the vine withered immediately.
The students were surprised and discovered what happened, and they said: "Why did the grapevine dry up at that time?"
And Jesus answered them: "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt at all, you will do what was done to the fig tree. But you will also say to this mountain: 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea!' and it will happen."
Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.» The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
And when Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to him while he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them: "I also will ask you one question; if you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
Where did John’s baptism come from? From the heavens or from people? » So they argued among themselves: «If we say: "From the heavens," they will ask us: "Then why did you not believe in him?"»
But if we say: "From the people." we fear the people's opinion because they all believe that John is a prophet.
Then Jesus answered: "We don't know." And Jesus said to them: "Even I do not tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the two boys.
What do you think? There is a man who has two children. He went to the first and said to him: "My son, go work today in the grape vineyard."
My brother, answer his son: "I'm not going." But then he regretted it and left.
And he went to his other son and told him the same thing he told his first son, so he answered him: "I'm leaving, sir!" But he didn't leave.
Anna Hu Malzouz, the brothers who did what they loved, what about him? The elders told them: "The first." Jesus said to them: "I tell you the truth: those who gather in taxes and corrupt women are entering the kingdom of God before you."
John came to you, how righteous a man he is. Brother, I didn't believe in him, but those who collected taxes and corrupt women believed in him. And even when you saw that thing, you didn't repent or believe in him." Like the servants of the vineyard (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
Listen to another example: there was a man who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a wall, built a press inside, made a lookout and a watchtower for a group of five, and traveled to other countries.
And as the time approaches when the grapes will ripen, his servants sent to the vineyard to send him the harvest.
They grabbed his servants and beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another with a stone.
The master of the grapes sent the servants again, more than he sent them the first time; they did the same thing to them.
They sent them away and said: "Now my son can."
When the five saw the boy, they said to each other: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his heirs!"
They grabbed him, took him out of the grapevine area, and killed him.
So, when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do with these five?
The Jewish elders told him: "To kill these wicked people in this way and to give the grapevine to five others who will give him the bunch of grapes at the right time."
# Psalm 118:22-23; Acts 4:11; 2 Peter 2:7 Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
That is why I tell you: the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
# 21:44 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard these parables, they understood that he was speaking about them.
But they tried to arrest him, fearing the people, because they considered him a prophet.
Like the king's feast (Luke 14:15-24)
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables and said:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who held a wedding feast for his son.
The servants went to call the invitees for the wedding evening, but they did not come.
And other servants were sent again and said: "Tell the guests: I have prepared my dinner and slaughtered the fat oxen and cows, everything is ready, come to the wedding feast!"
But they didn't account for the evening gathering and went their separate ways; one went to his own place, and the other went to his shop.
And others grabbed his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
The king was enraged and sent his soldiers to kill those criminals and burn their city.
And Mabaid said to his servants: "The evening gathering was prepared, but the guests do not deserve it."
Come on, walk through the streets and invite as many people as you can to the wedding party.
And those servants went out to the road and brought in all the poor and the maimed, and the lame and the blind. So the house was filled with guests.
But when the king came to see the guests, he saw a man not wearing a suit. So they said:
How did you get in here and you're not wearing wedding clothes? Did the man stay silent?
At that time, the king said to the servants: "Hold him by his hands and feet, and throw him outside into the darkness, so that there will be crying and the lamenting of the years."
Many people are calling me, but only a few are chosen.» Paying taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
At that time, the Pharisees went out and conspired how to get Jesus with a word.
And they sent their students along with a group from Herod's party and said to him: "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in truth, and care about no one; for your concern is not for the positions of people."
He asked us: What do you think? Are we allowed to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus, surpassing their wickedness, said to them: "You hypocrites! Why do you test me?"
Show me the tax money! Then he brought him a silver spoon.
Jesus asked them: "Whose picture is this, and whose name is this?"
They said: "The possessions of Caesar!" So my brother told them: "Well, give Caesar's possessions to Caesar, and God's possessions to God!"
And they were amazed when they heard that statement, and they left and went away. The resurrection of the dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
On that day, the Sadducees came to Jesus, and they are the ones who say that there is no resurrection after death, and they asked him a question.
# Deut 25:5 And they said: "Teacher, Moses said: 'If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry his widow and produce children for his brother.'"
There were seven brothers among us, and the first brother's wedding took place, and he died without having children, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same happened to the second and third, even to the seventh brother.
And after them, everyone else, the woman died.
So on the Day of Judgment, this woman will be among them, because she married all of them.
Jesus answered them: "You are mistaken, because you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God."
On the Day of Judgment, they will neither marry nor be married, but they will be like the angels in the sky.
As if you are at the resurrection of the dead, my brother, haven't you read what Allah told you:
# 3:6 Is He not the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
And when people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
But when they heard the Pharisees, who were silent, the Sadducees came together.
And one of them, who is a scholar of Sharia, asked a question to test:
Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?
# Deut 6:5 Jesus answered: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest advice.
# Luke 19:18; Matthew 19:19; Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:9; James 2:8 And the second commandment is like it: love your neighbor as yourself.
The entire Sharia and the prophets are based on these two commandments.» Christ and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he? They told him: "Son of David!"
He told them: "How is it that David calls him 'the Lord' when he is his son?"
Psalm 110:1; Acts 2:34-35; Hebrews 1:13; 10:13 The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
If David calls him "Our Lord," then how can he be his son?
And no one could answer him with a word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any question.
Jesus warns against the books of the Jews and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
The book of the Jews and the Pharisees sitting on the seat of Moses.
So do and remember everything they tell you. But don't do as they do, because they say and don't do:
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, even though they don't touch it with their finger.
They do everything so that people can see them, they grow in their arrogance and prolong their foolishness in their attire.
And they like to sit in the front seats at the parties and the first chairs at the gatherings
And people like to greet them in the markets, calling out to them: "O teachers"
But you don't let anyone call you: "teachers," because you all consider yourselves brothers and have only one teacher.
And don't say to anyone on earth, "Oh, Father," because you have only one Father who is in heaven.
And don't let anyone tell you: "Oh sir" because you have only one Lord, who is Christ.
And let your elder serve you
Whoever humbles himself will be exalted, and whoever exalts himself will be humbled.
But woe to you, scribes of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who are trying to enter to do so.
# 23:14 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: Woe to you, scribes of the Jews, and Pharisees hypocrites! You deceive women whose husbands are dead and take their houses, and think that you prolong your prayers; that is why your judgment will be greater before God.
Woe to you, the book of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You strain the land and sea to bring one into your religion, and he enters; you turn him away, deserving of hell twice over!
Woe to you, sheikhs, you blind ones! Those who say: "Whoever swears by the Temple is not bound to his right hand, but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple is bound to his right hand."
Is Anna the one who has more value, you fools and blind ones? Gold or the temple that restored the gold is sacred?
And you say: "Whoever swears by the altar is not bound to anything, but whoever swears by the Eucharist above the altar is bound by his hand."
Is Anna the one who has more value, you blind ones? The sacrifice or the altar that makes the sacrifice sacred?
So whoever swears by the altar has sworn by it and by everything above it!
He swears by the Temple, he is swearing by it and by the one who dwells in it.
He swears by the sky, he swears by the throne and by Allah upon which it rests.
Woe to you, scribes of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You give a tenth of mint, dill, and cumin, but neglect the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These you should have practiced without neglecting the others.
You lead people, oh blind ones! You filter the water for the mosquito and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and greediness.
Oh Pharisee, you blind! First wash the cup and the dish from the inside so that they are also clean on the outside.
Woe to you, scribes of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! Like the tombs painted white, which look beautiful from the outside but are filled inside with the bones of the dead and all the unclean things.
And you two, outwardly appear righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
O book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the domes of the righteous saints,
And you say: "Jina was present in the time of our ancestors, so we did not participate with them in the killing of the prophets."
Here you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So you all have fulfilled your ancestors' balance.
Oh children of Al-Lafa'i, how will you escape the punishment of the torment of Hell?
That is why I am sending you prophets, wise men, and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and drive them from city to city.
# Taq 4:8; Heb 11:4; Zech 1:1; II Chr 24:21 So that all pure blood shed on the earth may come upon you, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth: all these bad things will come upon this generation!» Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
Oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how many times I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you were not willing.
This is your house so that it remains a ruin.
I'm telling you: you won't see me anymore until the time comes when you say: "Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Jesus speaks about the destruction of the temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus exited the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came up to him and showed him the buildings of the temple.
My brother told them: "Did you see this whole thing? I tell you the truth: not even a stone here is going to stay on top of its neighbor, everything will fall." The catastrophe and persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him and asked: "Tell us, when will this happen, and what are the signs of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them: "Be careful and do not let anyone deceive you."
Many people will come in my name, saying: "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many people.
And when you hear about wars nearby and wars in distant places, do not be afraid. This thing is bound to happen, but that is not the end.
It is a people fighting against a people, and a kingdom against a kingdom, and there will be hunger and earthquakes in many places.
This is all just the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
And at that time, they will take you to torment and kill you. All the peoples will hate you because of My name.
And at that time, many people will stop believing, betray each other, and hate one another.
Many false prophets appear and deceive many people.
And most people will no longer have love, because evil will increase.
But the one who proves to others that he is worth paying.
And the Gospel of the Kingdom of God will be proclaimed throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.» The Great Destruction (Mark 13:14-23; Luke 21:20-24)
# Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 «Then, when you see the "abomination of desolation" spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place (let the reader understand).
At this time, let those in Judaism escape to the mountains.
And leave those upstairs; he doesn't go down to carry the things in his house.
And leave what's in the tongue so it doesn't come back to carry its burden.
Woe to them, the pregnant women and those who nurse during these days.
Ask my Lord that you escape on a day that is neither winter nor Saturday.
Because at that time, there will be great hardship; nothing like it has happened before in the world until now.
And if Allah did not fall short on those days, then no one was saved except humans. But He was lenient with them because of the people He chose.
And at that time, if someone tells you: "Here is the Messiah" or "Here he is, the one who is coming," do not believe it!
Many people will appear like the Antichrist and lying prophets, performing great deeds and miracles to deceive, even the chosen people, if possible.
Hani, I warned you before.
So if they tell you: "Here is the Messiah in the wilderness!" do not go out; if they tell you: "Here he is in the secret houses," do not believe!
It is like lightning flashing from the east and illuminating the far west; so will the Son of Man come.
And where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather." The Son of Man (Mark 13:24-27; Luke 21:25-28)
# Revelation 8:12; Isaiah 13:10; Ezekiel 32:7; Joel 2:10-11; Zephaniah 1:15 «And at the time of these calamities, the sun will become dark, and the light of the moon will be hidden. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will shake.»
And at that time, my sign will appear: I, the Son of Man, in heaven, and all the thrones on earth will mourn, and they will see me, the Son of Man, coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And I will send my angels to shout with their loud horns and gather those I have chosen from the four directions of the wind, from the end of the world to the end of the sky." The lesson is from the parable (Mark 13:28-31; Luke 21:29-33)
Take the lesson from honor: as soon as the sticks turn green and produce paper, know that summer is near.
And you also see these things happening, you know that I am close to the doors.
I tell you the truth: this generation will not fulfill until all these things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Always prepare yourselves (Mark 13:32-37; Luke 17:26-30; 12:39-40).
But today and at this hour, no one knows them, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, only the Father alone knows them.
Just as it happened in Noah's time, so it will happen when I, the Son of Man, come.
They were just like the people during those days before the floods, eating, drinking, and getting married, until Noah entered the ship.
They didn't even think of anything until the floods came and swept them all away. That's how it will happen when I, the Son of Man, come.
This time, there will be two men in the alley, one will be shaken and the other will stay.
The buzzing of women sitting at the millstone, threshing wheat; one shakes while the other remains still.
Wake up, you don't know about the day your Lord will come.
But if they knew this, the master of the house would know when the thieves would break in, so he stayed awake and didn't let his house be stolen.
That is why you also prepare yourselves; I am the Son of Man to come at an hour you do not expect. — Like the faithful servant (Luke 12:41-48)
Who is the trustworthy servant who knows how to behave and whose master and everyone at his home rely on to give them their food on time?
Why is it that the servant returns to his master and finds his work done?
I tell you the truth: it's just to deceive all your property.
But if this servant turned evil and said between himself and his Lord: "My master will return later."
And he started hitting the other servants, eating and drinking with the drunkards,
Sido will regret returning on a day he doesn't think of and at an hour he doesn't know.
So they cut him into pieces and put him in the place where the hypocrites are headed. Where will the crying and the lamenting of the years be?
Like the girls
For the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were ignorant, and five knew how to behave.
When the fools raised their lanterns, they didn't bring oil with them.
But those who know how to behave, lifted their oil cans along with their lanterns.
And the groom's friends, everyone was overcome by sleep and fell asleep.
But at midnight, they heard a cry: "The groom is coming, go out to meet him!"
Dude, all the girls got up and lit their lanterns.
And the ignorant ones, those who know how to behave, said: "Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out."
But those who know how to behave replied: "Maybe it won't be enough for us and for you, go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
And when they were on their way to buy, the groom arrived. The attendees entered the house where the wedding was held, and the door was closed.
And when the other girls came closer, they said to the groom: "O our lord, our lord, open the door for us!"
But he replied to them: "I tell you the truth: I do not know you."
So, prepare yourselves, for your own sake, you won't know either today or the hour.» Like a bag of money (Luke 19:11-27)
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who loves to travel; he called his servants and gave them his money.
He gave each one according to their ability, he gave one five bags of gold, another two bags of gold, and another one bag and then traveled.
Whoever took the five sacks went quickly and traded with them, man, he earned five more sacks.
He took two bags and added, earning two more bags.
But the one who took a single bag went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.
And after a long time, the master of the servants returned and held them accountable.
Then he took the five sacks, brought five more sacks and said: "My master, you gave me five sacks, I have earned five more sacks."
They said, Sido: "You woke up, O servant, O righteous one, O trustworthy! I used to trust little, now I will reward you generously: enter the bliss of your master."
So he took the two bags, and he also said: "Sir, you gave me two bags, I have won two more bags."
They said, Sido: "You woke up, O servant, O righteous and trustworthy! I trusted you a little, now I will reward you generously: enter your master's paradise."
But he took only one bag, and he also came, and said: "Sir, I know that you are a harsh man, reaping what you did not plant, gathering what you did not sow."
Man, I was scared, so I walked away and hid your bag in the dirt, and here is your money.
But Sido replied: "Oh servant, oh wicked one, oh careless! I know that I reap what I did not sow and gather what I did not plant,
You should have put my money in the bank, and I would have taken it back with interest.
He said to his servants: Take the bag from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
It's the one who has, so that it increases and he has a lot. But the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken from him.
And the servant who is of no benefit at all, throw him outside into the darkness. Where will the crying and the lamenting of the years be on the Day of Judgment?
When I come, Son of Man, in my glory, and all the angels with me, at that time I will sit on my glorious throne.
# Zephaniah 3:17 And all the peoples will gather before me, and I will separate them from each other, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
And when I put the sheep on my right, the goats I put on my left.
And so I said to the one on my right: "Come, the one your father blessed, inherit the kingdom that was made for you since the day the world was created."
Because I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you quenched me, I was a stranger and you settled me.
I was naked and you dressed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was tied up and you came to me.
At this time, the righteous will answer: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You? Or thirsty and give You drink?"
And when did we see you as a stranger and hide you? Or naked and clothe you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
And I, the king, will answer them: "I tell you the truth, every time you did that thing with one of my little brothers, you did it with me!"
And so I say to those on my left: "Move me away, you cursed ones, go to the fire that was prepared for the devil and his angels forever."
I was hungry and you didn't feed me, I was thirsty and you didn't give me water.
And I was a stranger and you did not settle me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and bound and you did not visit me.
And they both added to answer: "Oh Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not help You?"
And I will answer them: "I tell you the truth every time you haven't done that thing with one of my little brothers, you haven't done it with me."
And they will go to be tortured forever, but the righteous will go to eternal life.
The Jews are trying to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53)
When Jesus finished all these words, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter is in two days, and I, the Son of Man, will be handed over to be crucified.
And at that time, the chief priests and elders of the people gathered in the house of Caiaphas, the highest among the chief priests.
And they conferred together to devise a plan to arrest Jesus and kill him.
But they said: "We didn't ask for it on Eid, so it doesn't become a mess in the middle of the people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
Then, when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
She came to me with a very expensive perfume bottle in her hand, and she poured it over his head while he was eating.
When the students saw her, they got angry and said: "Why this waste?"
This perfume could be sold for a lot of money, and the proceeds go to the poor!
But Jesus knew this and told them: "Why are you worried about the woman? She has done something good for me."
The poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
And if she poured perfume on my body, she is preparing me for the grave.
I tell you the truth: where will this person be praised with the Gospel in the whole world? People will talk about her deeds, and she will always be remembered.» Judas' betrayal (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
At that time, a student named Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests.
# Hosea 21:32; Zechariah 11:12 And he said to them, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?" So they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And at that time, he began to wait for an opportunity to betray him. The Passover dinner with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked Him: "Do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you to eat?"
He told them: "There is someone in the city, go tell him: 'The teacher says: My watch has arrived, so I will have the Passover dinner at your house with my disciples.'"
And the students did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his twelve disciples.
And when they were eating, Jesus said: "I tell you the truth: one of you will betray me."
They were very sad and started saying to each other one by one: "Is it really me, oh Lord?"
Tell them: "Whoever puts their hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me."
# Zechariah 41:9 I, the Son of Man, must die just as it is written about me in the Holy Bible. Woe to the man who will betray me! That man would be better off if he had never been born.

And when they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples and said: "Take, eat; this is my body."
He took a cup and gave it to them, saying: "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that was shed for many people so that their sins may be forgiven.
We tell you: I won't be drinking this grape juice anymore, until that day comes when I drink it with you again in Papa's kingdom.
And they swam away, glorifying their Lord with singing, and went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus tells Peter that he will deny Him (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38).
# Zech 13:7; John 16:32 Then Jesus said to them: "All of you will go away and leave me tonight; it is written in the Bible: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered."
Furthermore, when I rise from the dead, I am coming to surpass you for the Most High.
My brother said Peter: "Even if everyone leaves you, I will never leave you."
Jesus said: "I tell you the truth: tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said, "I am not going to deny you even if I have to die with you." And all the disciples said the same to him. Jesus prays in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46).
And Jesus went a little further with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them: "Sit here, until I go over there and pray."
And Peter and the two sons of Zebedee shook with him, and he began to feel in his spirit sad and troubled.
This time he told them: "I feel like my soul is very sad to the point of death. Wait here and stay alert."
Then he stayed on them a little, fell on his knees, and prayed, saying: "Oh Dad, if possible, after this cup. But let it be what you love, not what I love."
And he returned to the students and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: "My brother, can't you stay awake with me for even an hour?"
Stay awake and pray so you don't experience a test. The soul wants to stay alert, but the body is weak.
And again he prayed and said: "Dad, if this cup cannot be taken away from me and I am required to drink it, let your will be done, not mine."
And he returned again and found them sleeping, because they couldn't lift their heads from sleep.
But let them go again, and after that he will pray for the third time, and he will speak again with his hand.
And Mubaid came to the students and said to them: "Hey, are you still sleeping and resting? The hour has come, and the Son of Man will deliver me into the hands of the sinners."
Let's go, let's go! Here comes the one who will betray me.» Jesus was seized (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12)
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, came with many people carrying swords and sticks. The chief priests and elders of the people sent them.
Wali Khano gave them a sign and said: "The one we're going to kiss is this one, hold him!"
And at that time, they went out to Jesus and said: "Peace, Teacher!" and they passed by.
They said Jesus: "My friend. Do the thing I came for." At that moment, they came and put their hands on Jesus and seized him.
And one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
And at that time Jesus said: "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Dude, are you thinking that I can't ask my dad, and at the same time he sends me more than twenty armies of angels?
But how will the holy books that say this thing must happen come about?
And Jesus said to the people: "Brothers, you have made me a criminal, coming at me with swords and sticks? Every day I was teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me."
But all of this happened so that what was said in the books of the prophets would come true. At that time, the students left him and ran away. Jesus in the council of the Jews (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24)
Then they seized Jesus, and they took him to Caiaphas, who was the highest among the chief priests, where they gathered the elders and the scribes of the Jews.
And Peter was following him from a distance until he reached the courtyard of the high priest's house. He went inside and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
And the heads of the priests and I, in the council of the Jews, all of them are searching for someone to testify falsely against Jesus so they can kill him.
But they couldn't find out how, even though many people came forward and testified falsely. And then two witnesses came forward.
And they said: «This man said: "I can tear down God's temple and rebuild it in three days."»
And the highest among the chief priests said: "Hey brother, don't you have anything to answer? Hey brother, don't you hear how these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. And the highest among the chief priests asked him: "I swear to the living God, tell us: are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
They said Jesus: "You said that. But I tell you: today you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the power of God and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
He cut off the top of the chief priest Dabsho and said: "This is disbelief! Do we still need witnesses? Here, you just heard him, it's disbelief."
What did they sentence him to? » They answered: «He must die!»
They spat on him and hit him with their hand, and some of them were the ones who hit him.
And they said: "Prophesy for us, Jesus! Who is it that struck you?" Peter denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
And at that time, Peter was sitting outside in the middle of the house when a servant came and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee!"
But he denied everyone in front of them, and said: «I don't understand what you mean.»
And when he went out to the outer door, he saw another servant and said to those present: "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied again, swearing and saying: "I don't know this man!"
A little later, the people present came and said to Peter: "Certainly, you are one of them too; speak like them for your sake!"
At that moment, he started swearing and shrugging: "I don't know this man." And immediately, the partridge shouted,
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus as a rooster crowed: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
And in the morning, the chiefs of the priests and the elders of the people all conspired to kill Jesus.
They seized him, shook him, and handed him over to Pilate the governor. The death of Judas (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he regretted it and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
And he said to them: "I committed a sin by sending the blood of an innocent person." They replied: "We don't care? Deal with it yourself."
He threw the silver into the temple and left, then hanged himself.
But the chief priests of the magicians shook the silver and said, "It's not lawful to put it in the treasury of the temple, since it is blood money."
So they agreed and bought from the potter's seller the second hand to turn it into a cemetery where they would bury the dead.
That is why this tongue is called the tongue of blood to this day.
Zech 11:12-13; Jer 32:6-15; 18:2-3 And so was the thing that the prophet Jeremiah said: "And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver, the price set by the children of Israel for whom they valued me,"
And they gave them to buy a pottery seller's second hand. Just as my Lord commanded me." Pilate questions Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
And Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him: "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered him: "You say so."
But when the chiefs of the soothsayers and elders accuse him, he doesn't answer at all.
Pilate said: "My brother, don't you hear how many things they are testifying against you?"
But they didn't answer any of them, until the governor was very surprised. The judgment of Jesus to death (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And on every holiday, the governor would leave the people one of the Mlarabite they liked.
And at that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
And when they gathered, Pilate said to them: "Who do you want me to release for you: Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?"
Because he knew they handed him over out of jealousy.
Add to this that when Pilate was sitting in the court, his wife sent him a message and said: "Be careful not to do anything to that righteous man, I am very worried about him because of a dream I had tonight."
And the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
The governor said to them again: "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" And they said: "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them: "Then what do you want me to do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?" They all said: "Crucify him!"
He said: «Why, what evil did he do?» But they started shouting even more: «Kill him!»
Then, when Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd and said: "I am innocent of this man's blood! You see to it yourselves."
And everyone responded: "We and our children are wanted with blood!"
And they led Jesus away to be crucified, and they delivered Him to be crucified after they had scourged Him. The soldiers mocked Jesus (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3).
And as the soldiers shook Jesus, they took him to the governor's palace, and the entire military squad gathered in front of him.
And we try to dress him and he wears a red outfit.
They made a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, put a reed in his hand, and bowed down before him while mocking him, saying: "Long live the King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, grabbed the pipe, and hit him on the head with it.
And after they mocked him, they tried to put the red robe on him, they dressed him in a cloak and shook him to make him stiff. Jesus on the cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
And when they were leaving the city, a man from Qirina named Simon was forced to carry the cross of Jesus.
And when they reached a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull"
He gave him a mixed drink called "Mar" to drink, but when they tasted it, they didn't want to drink it.
# Psalm 22:18 And when they crucified Him, they cast lots for His clothing.
And they sat and kept watching him go by.
And they placed his accusation over his head on a placard that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
They crucified him with two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
# Psalm 22:7-8; 109:25 And the people who pass by mock him, shaking their heads and saying:
If you're going to tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross if you are the Son of God.
And the heads of the magicians and the scribes of the Jews, and the elders, they also mocked him and said:
Other people have finished, and he can't finish himself! He is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him.
Mao trusted in God and said: "I am the son of God." Let God save him if He is pleased with him.
And the criminals who were crucified with him also insulted him verbally. Jesus' death (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)

# Psalm 22:1 And Jesus cried out loudly with the three companions: "Eli! Eli! Why have you forsaken me?" which means "My Lord! My Lord! Why have you abandoned me?"
And some of those standing there, upon hearing him, said: "This man is calling for Elijah!"
# Maz 69:21 And one of them ran and shook the bottle, blew into it with vinegar, put it in a pipe, and handed it to him to drink.
But the others said: «Wait, let's see if Elijah is coming to save him!»
And Jesus shouted out loudly again and breathed his last.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.
The graves were decorated, and many donkeys of the saints lying there stood up.
And they came out of the tomb after Jesus rose, and they went to the holy city and appeared to many people.
When the captain of the sea and those who were with him to Jesus saw how the earth shook and the things that happened, they were terrified and said: "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"
And there were many women watching from afar, and they were the ones who followed Jesus from Galilee and served Him.
Among them are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's children. They buried Jesus (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42).
In the evening, a wealthy man named Joseph from the Ramah area came, and he was also one of Jesus' disciples.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And Joseph of Arimathea took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And they buried him in a new grave they dug for his soul in the stone, and placed a large stone at the door of the grave and walked away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The women at the tomb.
And the next morning, which is after the day they were present, the chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate.
And they said: "Remember us, our Lord, how that Dajjal said when he was alive: 'I will rise after three days.'"
That's why I order them to visit the grave on the third day, so that his disciples don't go and steal it and tell the people: "He has risen from the dead," and thus deceive the people more than the previous mistake!
Pilate said to them: "You have a guard; go and make it as secure as you know how."
Then they went and put the candle on the grave and soldiers to guard the tomb.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And after Saturday passed and at dawn on Sunday, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
My brother, a big earthquake happened, an angel from my Lord descended from the sky, came after the stone, and sat on it.
And his appearance was like lightning, and his hair was white as snow.
The guards tremble with fear of him, just like the dead.
But the angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here; he did as he said. Come and see the spot where he was placed.
And walk in peace and tell your disciples: "He has risen from the dead, and he will go ahead of you to Galilee, and you will see him there." I told you.
And they went to the grave quickly while they were scared and very happy, and they ran to the students.
And at the bend, Jesus appeared to them and said, "Peace." My brother, he came close, grabbed his leg, and bowed down to him.
My brother told them Jesus said: "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me." The thing the soldiers said.
When the women went there, some soldiers returned to the city and told the chiefs of the priests about all the things that had happened.
And as the chiefs of the sorcerers gathered with the elders, they consulted and gave a lot of money to the soldiers.
And they told them: "Tell the people: 'They came at night and stole it while we were sleeping.'"

# Isa 40:3 "A voice of one calling in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God."
John the Baptist went into the wilderness, calling for baptism of repentance so that sins would be forgiven.
And they went out to the people in the Judea region and those living in all of Jerusalem, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan Valley after they confessed their sins.
And John’s clothing was made of camel’s hair, and a leather belt was around his waist; he ate locusts and wild honey.

And Jesus went away with his disciples to Capernaum, and on the Sabbath day Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The attendees remained amazed at his teaching because he was teaching them as someone with authority, not like the Jewish scribes.
There was a man in the neighborhood who lived alone, very close to his soul.
He said: "What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
My brother Jesus commanded him and said: "Be quiet! Come out of him."
The possessed spirit's epilepsy, the man, shouted loudly and left it.
Everyone was amazed and started asking each other: "What is this? New education with authority! Even the possessed spirits obey him when he commands them!"
And at the same time, the news of Jesus spreads throughout the regions of Galilee. Simon's mother-in-law is healed (Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41).
And once Jesus and his disciples left the synagogue, they went to Simon's and Andrew's house, accompanied by James and John.
Nusaybah Simaan was lying on the bed with a fever, and at that time, Jesus was called upon her.
He grabbed her and pulled her from her hand and stood her up, and immediately the heat struck her, and she started working for them.
And in the evening, when the sun set, people brought the sick and all those who lived in the neighborhoods.
And all the people in Jerusalem gathered in front of the gate.
And he healed many people who were suffering from many diseases and many citizens went out. And he did not let the citizens speak about him because they knew who he was. Jesus goes to Galilee (Luke 4:42-44)
And today, early tomorrow morning, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and began to pray.
And Simon and I went looking for him.
And when they found him, they said: "Everyone is looking for you!"
He told them: "Let's go to the nearby cities so I can spread the news because I came for this purpose."
And he went about preaching in the synagogues of the Jews in the entire region of Galilee and also in the streets. The leper is healed (Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16).
A leper man with a beard was walking and fell on his knees in front of him and said: "If you love me, you can heal me."
My brother, Jesus had mercy on him, stretched out His hand, and said: "I love you, be healed!"
And as soon as Jesus spoke, the leprosy left him and he was healed.
And at that time, Jesus commanded him to go and warned him.
# Leviticus 13:49; 14:2-32 And they said: "Be careful, don't tell anyone. But go to the priest, let him see you and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, so that you may be healed; this will be a testimony for them."
But he walked and started calling out and spreading the news until Jesus could no longer enter even the city openly, and he began to dwell in the wilderness, with people coming to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Matthew 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
After a few days, Jesus returned to the region of Capernaum and the news spread that he was in the house.
A lot of people gathered until there was no space left in front of the door. And he started talking to them about the word of God.
They brought a paralyzed man, carrying him with four men.
But they couldn't get close to him because of the large crowd. They climbed onto the roof of the house where Jesus was and lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man: "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And among the people, a group of the Book (Jews) began to think in their hearts:
Is this man really talking like that? He's cursing! Who other than Allah alone can forgive sins?
And at that time, Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked them: "Why are you thinking about this?"
Is it easier? To tell the paralyzed person: "Your sins are forgiven" or to say: "Get up! Take your mat and go."
So you know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," and then he said to the paralyzed man:
Move! Shake your mattress and go home.
He arrived on time, shook his mattress, and walked in front of all the people. Everyone was amazed and praised God, saying: "We have never seen anything like this before!" Christ calls Levi (Matthew 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
And Jesus went out again to the shore of the lake, and all the people gathered around him, and he began to teach them.
And when he was walking, he saw Laiwi, the son of Halfi, sitting in the tax office, and he told him: "Follow me!" So he got up and followed him.
And when Jesus was sitting and eating at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with him and his disciples. And many of them followed him.
And when the book of the Jews and the Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with tax collectors, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard them and answered: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have come to call sinners, not the righteous." The discussion on fasting (Matthew 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)
And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and some people came to Jesus and asked him: "Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?"
Tell them: "Can the guests at the wedding fast while the groom is still among them? As long as the groom is with them, they cannot fast."
But the days will come when the groom will be far from them, and at that time they will fast.
There is no one who can fix an old garment with a piece of new fabric; the new piece will shrink and eat into the old garment, making the tear bigger.
There is no one who puts new wine into old wineskins so that the new wine does not burst the wineskins. The new wine is put into new wineskins. Discussion on Saturday (Matthew 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)
And Jesus passed through on a Sabbath day in the middle of the crops, and His disciples plucked the grain as they were walking through the fields of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus: "Look, why do your disciples do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
Tell them: "Hey, didn't you read what David did and how he helped when they were in need and hungry?"
# 1 Samuel 21:1-6; 2 Samuel 8:17 How did he enter the house of God at the time of Abiathar, who was the highest among the priests, and all the bread of the offering that only the priests were allowed to eat? And he also gave some to his companions to eat?
And he added: "Saturday is for man's benefit, not man who is created to be a servant of Saturday."
Anna, the Son of Man, Lord of the Sabbath, added.
The man whose hand is withered is healed (Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
And Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man with a withered hand.
They started watching him to see if he would cure that man on Saturday or not. So they could accuse him.
My brother told the man who was giving him a slap: "Get up and stand in the middle!"
And Mubaid said to them: "My brothers, is it permissible on Saturday to do good or evil? Should we save ourselves or kill ourselves?" But they remained silent.
Jesus touched him, feeling upset and very sad because of the hardness of their hearts, and he said to the man: "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and behold, it was restored to health.
The Pharisees left the assembly and immediately began to conspire with members of Herod's party to kill him.
Jesus and his disciples walked along the Sea of Galilee and followed him, with many people from the Galilee region and Judea.
And Jerusalem, Edom, and from the areas that go from the Jordan Valley, and many people from the places surrounding the city of Tyre and Sidon because they heard about what they did.
Jesus told his disciples to prepare a boat for him so that people wouldn't crowd him.
Because of him, many people got healed, but now every sick person comes to him for treatment.

And the twelve he chose are: Simon, whom he named Peter
And Jacob, and John, the sons of Zebedee, whom He named Boanerges, meaning Sons of Thunder
Andreas, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James, who also betrayed his country.
And Judas Iscariot who betrayed him. Jesus and Beelzebul (Matthew 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And Jesus went to the house, and again the people gathered around until Jesus and his disciples could no longer eat.
And when his relatives heard, they came to take him away because people said: "He has lost his mind."
And the book of the Jews who descended from Jerusalem said: "He is the inhabitant of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, and he is casting out demons by their ruler!"
Jesus lamented to them and spoke to them in parables, saying: "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom is divided among itself, it's not possible for me to continue.
And if the house is divided among itself, this house cannot stand.
