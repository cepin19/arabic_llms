The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Ibrahim brought Isaac. And Isaac brought Jacob. And Jacob brought Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar. Perez begat Hezron. And Hezron begat Aram.
Aram went to Amynadab. And Amynadab went to Nahshon. And Nahshon went to Salmon.
Salmon brought Boaz from Rahab. Boaz brought Obed from Ruth. Obed brought Jesse.
Wissi gave birth to King David. After that, David fathered Solomon with the woman who had taken Uriah.
And Solomon begat Rehoboam. And Rehoboam begat Abijah. And Abijah begat Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat begat Joram. And Joram begat Azariah.
And Azariah begat Jotham. And Jotham begat Ahaz. And Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
Hezekiah fathered Manasseh. Manasseh fathered Amon. Amon fathered Josiah.
Josiah took Jeconiah and his brothers when the Jews were exiled in Babylon.
And after their period of exile in Babylon, Kenaniah brought Shaltiel. And Shaltiel brought Zerubbabel.
Zor Babel brought Abihood. Abihood brought Elyakim. Elyakim brought Azur.
And Azor brought Sadok. And Sadok brought Ahim. And Ahim brought Eliud.
And Eliud bore Eliezer. And Eliezer bore Matan. And Matan bore Jacob.
And Jacob took Joseph, the son of Mary who gave birth to Jesus, called the Christ.
Thus, we find fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile in Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile in Babylon until the coming of Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
Here is how Jesus Christ was born: When Mary, my mother, was engaged to a man named Joseph, and before they married, she became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
My brother, Youssef, decided to warn her fiancé to stay away from her without exposing her, because he was a man who fears God.
And he is still pondering the matter, when an angel from my Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said: "O Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit."
And when you have a child, you name him Jesus, so that he can save his people from their sins.
And all of this happened so that the words that my Lord spoke through the Prophet would be fulfilled:
# Isaiah 7:14 The young woman will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him "Emmanuel." (which means "God with us")
And when Joseph woke up from sleep, he did as the angel from my Lord had told him, and he went with his wife to his house.
But he didn't sleep with her until she gave birth to the child, and he named him Jesus.
The life of the wise
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the region of Judea, during the time of King Herod, a group of wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
And they said: "Where is the king of the Jews who was born? We saw his star rise in the east, and now we are coming to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he and all of Jerusalem were disturbed.
And the heads of the magicians and the scribes of the Jews, all of them, asked them about the place where Christ was born.
Answer them: "In Bethlehem, in the Judea region, because this is what the prophet wrote in the book:"
# Micah 5:2 And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.
But Herod called the wise men without hearing anyone and confirmed from them the time when the star appeared.
And when He sent them to Bethlehem, He said to them: "Go and visit the child. When you find Him, come back and tell me so I can also go and worship Him."
After hearing the king's words, they left. And while they were on the way, suddenly the star they had seen before in the east appeared, moving ahead of them until it reached and stopped above the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they were very happy.
They entered the house and found the child with Mother Mary. Suddenly, they descended from their mounts and prostrated to him, opened their bags, and presented gold, incense, and myrrh.
And my Lord warned them in their sleep not to return to Herod, so they took another route and went back to their country. The escape to Egypt
And after the wise men had gone, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Rise! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the child to kill him."
My brother Yusuf got up, took the child and his mother at night, and went to Egypt.
# Matthew 2:11; Exodus 4:22 and he dwelt there until Herod died, so that what the Lord had spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son." The young children in Bethlehem were killed.
And when Herod saw that the wise men mocked him, he became very angry and ordered the killing of all the male children in Bethlehem and in the surrounding areas who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.
My brother, the thing that the Prophet Jeremiah said has been accomplished:
# 31:15 "In Ramah they heard a cry, a great mourning and weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted—because they are no more." Return from Egypt to Nazareth
And when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, while he was in Egypt.
And they said: "People! Shake the child and his mother and return to the land of Israel, because those who wanted to kill him have died."
My brother got up, picked up the child and his mother, and returned to the Land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had become king of Judea in place of Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then he was warned by God in a dream, and he went to the region of Galilee.
And he went to a city called Nazareth and settled there to fulfill what the prophets said: "He will be called a Nazarene."
The testimony of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
And during these days, John the Baptist came to the wilderness of Judea to preach.
And he says: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!"
# Isaiah 40:3 And this is the John that the prophet Isaiah spoke about, saying: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God."
John was dressed in a garment made of camel hair, girded with a leather belt, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
And the people used to go to him from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the surrounding regions of Jordan.
And they confess their sins and their sins in the Valley of Jordan
And when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God?"
Do things that show what you want.
Do not say in your hearts: "We are the children of Abraham." I tell you, Allah is capable of making this stone the child of Ibrahim.
The axe is now placed on the tree's veins; the tree that doesn't yield good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I will baptize you with water so you may repent, and the one who comes after me is stronger than I am, and I do not deserve to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He shakes the bag of the board in his hand and sorts the catch in the hall, gathers the wheat in the warehouse, but the hay is burned with a fire that won't go out." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Jesus came from the Galilee region to Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John didn't leave him and said: "I'm the one who needs to be baptized by you; how come you are coming to me?"
But Jesus answered them: "Let this thing happen now, because in this way we complete all the good things." Then John agreed.
And when Jesus was baptized, he came out of the water, and at that moment the heavens opened. My brother saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on him.
And a voice from the heavens says: "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
My brother fasted for forty days and forty nights until he was hungry.
He approached him and said: "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
# Luke 4:3 Jesus answered: "It is written: Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."
And they shook the city of the holy place, and stood on the edge of the temple's roof.
# Psalm 91:11-12 And they said: "You are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the Holy Book: His angels will command concerning you, to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone."
# Deut 6:16 Jesus answered: "It is written also: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
He increased his arrogance and placed it atop a very high mountain, behind the kingdoms of the entire world and the glory within them.
And they said: "We'll give you all this if you come down on your knees and prostrate to me."
# Deut 6:13; Mark 8:33 My brother, Jesus replied: "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written in the Holy Bible, the Lord your God alone shall you worship, and Him only shall you serve."
And he left him alone and went away, and the angels came and began to serve him. Jesus preaches in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
And I heard Jesus that John took him back to the Galilee region.
And he went out to Nazareth and walked and settled in Capernaum, which is on the sea, at the border of the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
So that the thing that the Prophet Isaiah said can be done:
# Isaiah 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, by the sea, on the road to Jordan, Galilee of the nations!
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and those dwelling in the shadow of death, the light shone upon them.
And at that time, Jesus began to preach and say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." Jesus calls the disciples following (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11).
As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, whom he called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting their nets into the lake, because they were fishermen.
And he said to them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people."
And at the time, they left their window and followed him.
And he was walking along when he saw two other brothers: Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee repairing the nets, and he called them.
And at that time, they left their boat and followed him. Jesus teaches, preaches, and heals the sick (Luke 6:17-19)
And Jesus went around in the region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing all kinds of diseases and ailments among the people.
And Khabro spreads throughout Syria. He brought patients who suffered from various types of diseases and pains, including those who are homeless, epileptic, and paralyzed, and healed them.
Many people from Galilee and the region called the Ten Cities, Jerusalem, Judea, and the area on the other side of the Jordan followed them.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
And Jesus' disciples went up the mountain and sat down, and at that time His disciples came to Him.
And he began to teach them and said:
Their health is for them, the poor, in the soul! They are the kingdom of heaven to take.
Good for them, the mourners! They are here to find comfort.
Good health to the good people! They are the land to be inherited.
May the hungry and the thirsty for the truth be healthy! They are going to be satisfied.
Good for them, may they be blessed! They are about to be blessed.
Good for them, their hearts are pure! They are the face of God to be seen.
Good for those who reconcile people! They are God's children so they can be called.
Good for those who suffer for the sake of the truth! They will inherit the kingdom of heaven.
May your health be with you when people insult you, torment you, and speak all the bad words about you out of spite!
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven. This is how they persecuted the prophets before you.» Salt and Light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt no longer has its flavor, how can you restore its taste? It’s no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. There is no city built on a mountain that cannot be seen.
There is no one who lights a lighthouse and puts it under a bowl, but rather places it in a high place to illuminate the whole house.
Let your light shine before people in this way, so they see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.» Sharia
Don't think that I came to abolish the Sharia and the prophets; I did not come to abolish them but to complete them.
I tell you the truth: until the sky and the earth pass away, not a single letter or dot of the law will be removed until everything is completed.
Whoever does not obey one of these smallest commandments and teaches people to be like him will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you, unless you are more righteous than the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.» Deception
# Josh 20:13; 1 Thess 5:17; 16:18 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not kill, and whoever kills must be judged.'"
But I tell you: whoever gets angry with his brother must be judged by the court, and whoever says to his brother: "You fool," must be judged by the council of the Jews, and whoever says to his brother: "You idiot," must go to hell.
So when you offer your sacrifice at the altar and remember that you have a problem with your brother,
Leave your offering before the altar, go first and be reconciled with your brother, then come and present your gift.
And if someone complains about you, you and he should settle it quickly before you go to court, so he doesn't complain to the judge and the judge calls the police and you end up in jail.
You are right: you won't leave until you pay the last penny. » Adultery
# Hosea 20:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:18 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not commit adultery.'"
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your eye makes you make mistakes, pluck it out and throw it away; you're better off losing a part of your body than having your whole body thrown into hell.
And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." Divorce (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
Deuteronomy 24:1-4 "And it shall be said: 'Whoever divorces his wife, gives her a certificate of divorce.'"
But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife for reasons other than adultery allows her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman is committing adultery.» The oath
# Leviticus 19:12; Numbers 30:2; Deuteronomy 23:21 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not swear falsely, but be true to what you have promised to the Lord.'"
But I am telling you not to swear by anything at all, not by the sky because it is the throne of God,
# Isa 66:1; Acts 7:49; Ps 48:2 Neither on the earth, for the place where He places His feet, nor in Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
And don't swear by yourself, for your sake you won't be able to return even a single white or black hair.
Let your words be what they may or may not be, and anything extra beyond that is from the evil one." Revenge (Luke 6:29-30)
# Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21 "You have heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.'"
But I tell you: do not seek revenge when someone does evil to you. But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.
Whoever wants to fight with you to take your jacket, let him also take your hat.
And if someone forces you to go a kilometer with them, go two.
Whoever asks you for something, give it to them; and whoever wants to borrow from you, do not refuse them." Love your enemies (Luke 6:27-28, 32-36)
Did you hear what was said: "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
So that you become the children of the One in the sky. Because He makes His sun shine on the good and the bad, and gives rain to the righteous and the wicked.
What reward do you deserve if you want those who love you? Isn't it those who collect taxes that do this with their own hands?
And what have they decided if not for your sisters? Isn't it true that those who do not know my Lord are the ones who do this with their own hands?
You must all be complete, just as your Father in heaven is complete.
Charity
Be careful to do good in front of people so they can see you; otherwise, you have no reward from your Father in heaven.
When you give charity to someone, do not call out with a horn like the hypocrites do in gatherings and streets so that people will thank them. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
But when you give charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Let your charity be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." Prayer (Luke 11:2-4)
And when they pray, do not be like the hypocrites; they love to stand and pray in the mosques to be seen by people. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
But when you pray, enter your inner room, close the door, and pray to your unseen Father. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
And when you pray, don't sit around repeating empty talk like other people who, in their minds, think that God will listen to them when they say a lot of words.
Don't be like them, because your father knows what he needs before you ask him.
So pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may Your name be sanctified.
Let your kingdom come to us, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.
We did not enter into an ordeal, and from evil, we are saved.
And if people forgive each other's mistakes, then your Father in heaven will forgive you your sins.
But if you do not forgive people for their mistakes, even the One in heaven will not forgive you your sins.» Fasting
And when you fast, do not show grief on your faces like the hypocrites, who turn their faces sour to show people that they are fasting. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
But you, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face,
Let your fasting not be visible to people, but to your Father who sees in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.» Wealth (Luke 12:33-34)
Do not hide treasures in the earth from yourselves; they are corrupted by rot and pus, and thieves dig them up and steal them.
But store treasures in your souls in heaven, which neither moth nor rust destroys, nor do thieves break in and steal.
Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.» نور البدن (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lighthouse of the body. So if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be filled with light.
But if your eye is sick, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!» God or money (Luke 12:22-31; 16:13)
No one can serve two masters; either they will hate one and love the other, or follow one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
So I tell you, don't worry about your lives—what you're going to eat or drink, or what you'll wear. Isn't life better than food, and the body better than clothing?
Look at how the birds of the sky neither plant nor harvest nor store in a warehouse, and the One in the sky feeds them. Are you not much better than them?
And which of you is thinking that he can add an hour to his age?
And why do you worry about the clothes? Look at the nose of Bukhraoun how it grows: it neither tires nor spins.
But I tell you: even King Solomon in all his glory did not dress like one of them!
If God dresses hashish in a way like this, despite the fact that hashish today grows and tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire of the oven, then how much more so should those with weak faith be dressed by Him!
That's why you don't think and say: What are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
All these things are sought after by people who are not believers, and the One in the sky knows that you need them.
But you first seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and these things will be added to you.
That's why you shouldn't think about tomorrow; tomorrow is for him to think about himself. Every day is enough with the evil he has.
Do not judge people (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
Don't judge people so that they won't judge you.
The measure you judge others with will be used to judge you, and the measure you use will be used to measure for you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but not notice the plank in your own?
And how can you tell your brother: "Let me remove the straw in your eye" when your own eye has a mural?
You hypocrite! Remove the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give sacred things to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot, turn around and attack you.» Seek to receive (Luke 11:9-13)
Ask to take, strive to find, knock and it will be opened for you.
Everyone who asks receives, everyone who seeks finds, and everyone who knocks has the door opened for them.
Who among you asks his son for bread and gives him a stone?
And they don't ask for a fish to give him a snake?
If you are the wicked ones, know how to give good things to your children, then how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?
So, do with people the things you want them to do with you. This is what the Sharia and the prophets have said.» The narrow door (Luke 13:24)
Enter through the narrow door. Because the door of destruction is wide and easy, and many enter it.
But the path to life is narrow and difficult, and few find it." The tree and its fruit (Luke 6:43-44)
Beware of the false prophets, they come to you dressed in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
Their trick is to recognize them. Do thorns produce grapes, or does wild fig produce jujubes?
Therefore, every good tree yields good fruit, and every bad tree yields bad fruit.
Neither the beautiful tree yields bad fruit, nor the bad tree yields good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So that you may know them by their fruit." The saying and the action (Luke 13:25-27)
It's not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," that will enter the kingdom of heaven; rather, those who do the will of my Father in heaven are the ones who will enter.
On the Day of Judgment, many people will say to me: "Oh Lord, oh Lord, didn't we prophesy in Your name? And cast out demons in Your name? And perform many miracles in Your name?"
And I will tell them: "I never knew you. Stay away from the evil you do!" like the two houses (Luke 6:47-49)
Whoever listens to my words and acts upon them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain poured and floods came, and the wind blew strongly on this house, but it didn't collapse because its foundation is built on stone.
Whoever hears my words and does not act on them will be like an ignorant man who built his house on sand.
The rain poured, and floods came, and the wind blew on this house. Oh brother, it collapsed, and there's nothing left of it.
And as Jesus finished this speech, the people remained amazed at his teaching.
Because he knew in them like someone with authority, not like their book.
The leprous man is healed (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
When Jesus came down from the mountain, many people followed him.
And a leper came close to him, and bowed down to him, saying: "My Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
He extended his hand and said: "I love you, get well!" And immediately, the leper got well.
# Luke 14:2 And they said to Jesus: "Do not tell anyone until you go to the priest and let him see you. Then present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The servant of the water chief is healed (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-54)
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and a Roman military officer approached him, begging him and saying:
My lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering greatly and unable to move.
And Jesus said: "I am coming to heal him."
But the water guard replied: "Sir, I don't deserve for you to come and enter under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I am a man, I have someone to judge me, and I have soldiers to judge them. I tell one "Go!" he goes. And to another "Come!" he comes. And to my servant "Do this thing!" he does it.
When they heard Jesus, they were amazed and said to those who followed him: "I tell you the truth, not even in the children of Israel have I found such great faith."
Many people will come from the East and the West and sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But the children of the kingdom will grow up outside in the dark, and the crying and the suffering of the years will follow.
And Jesus said to the centurion: "Go, let it be done for you according to your faith." And the servant was healed at that very moment. Peter's mother-in-law was healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41).
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw Peter's sister-in-law lying with a fever.
She touched her hand; man, she's getting feverish. She got up and started working on him.
That evening, at sunset, he brought many people who lived in the neighborhoods, and he released spirits with a single word, healing all the patients.
# Ish 53:4 And this thing happened to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "Surely He has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows." Jesus or the world (Luke 9:57-62)
And when Jesus saw that there were many people around him, he instructed his disciples to go over to the other side of the lake.
And one of the Jews' book merchants came and said: "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said: "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another student said: "O our Lord, let us go first to bury our father."
But Jesus said: "Follow me and let the dead bury their own dead!" Jesus calms the storm (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples were confused.
A strong wind came to the lake until the waves covered the boat. Meanwhile, Jesus was sleeping.
And his students walked with him and evaluated him and said to him: "O Lord, prevent us, we are about to perish!"
And Jesus said to them: "Why are you so afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And people were amazed and said: "Who is this that even the wind and the lake obey him?" He drove out the spirits and healed the possessed (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
And Jesus went to the other side of the region of the Gerasenes. They brought to him two men who were possessed by demons, living among the tombs outside the city. They were very violent, so much so that no one could pass along that road.
And they would shout: "What is between us and you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the time?"
And there were many shepherds tending their flocks in a distant place.
And they begged him earnestly and said: "If you graduate, send us to the Halaff!"
He told them: "Go!" Then they went out and entered the hallaf, and all of them descended from the edge of the mountain to the sea and drowned in the water.
They fled the wilderness and entered the city, talking about everything, and Zouz went to the two men who lived in the neighborhoods.
My brother, everyone in the city went out to meet Jesus. They begged him to leave their area.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus got into the boat, crossed over, and came to His city.
And people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on his bed, and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralyzed man: "Take courage, my son; your sins are forgiven."
And there is a group of Jewish writers who said in their hearts: "This man has disbelieved!"
But Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said: "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven," or to say: "Get up and walk"?
But you should know that I, the Son of Man, have authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up! Take your bed and go home."
Hey, get up and go to his house.
And when the people saw what happened, they were afraid and glorified God, who gave authority like this to humans. Jesus calls Levi (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32).
And Jesus passed by and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow me." So he got up and followed Him.
When Jesus was sitting in Matthew's house and eating, many people, including tax collectors and sinners, came and sat with Jesus and his disciples.
And when they saw the Pharisees, they said to his disciples: "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
But when Jesus heard this, he said: "It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
# Hosea 6:6 Walk and learn what this verse means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." And I came to pray for sinners, not the righteous." Fasting (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus told them: "The friends of the bridegroom can mourn, but the bridegroom is still with them. The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one repairs an old garment with new fabric, because the fabric will absorb and eat away at the old garment, and the tear will become larger.
There is no one who puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will break. But new wine is put into new wineskins, so they are preserved both. The little girl Haya and the woman who touched Jesus are healed (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56).
When Jesus was speaking to them, a man from the chief priests came and knelt before him and said: "My daughter is still dead. Come and lay your hand on her, so she may live."
And Jesus got up and followed him, and his disciples followed him.
There was a woman suffering from bleeding from her teeth for a year, coming from the back and touching the edge of her gum.
Because she thought to herself: "If only I could just scratch him, then I would feel better."
The house of Jesus and its scout said to her: "Trust, my daughter, your faith has healed you." And immediately, the woman was well.
And when Jesus arrived at the house of the Jewish leader and saw the crowd singing in the courtyard and the people making a commotion,
He said: "Move away! The girl didn't die, she's just sleeping."
And when the people left, he entered and grabbed the girl by her hand, and she got up.
And the news about this thing is published in that entire area. Jesus heals two blind men.
And Jesus passed by from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out: "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
When he entered the house, the two blind men came to him. Jesus said to them: "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him: "Yes, Lord!"
But Jesus touched their eyes and said: "According to your faith, it will be done for you."
And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them: "Be careful, no one should know!"
But they went out and spread his news throughout this entire area. Jesus heals a man with a withered hand.
And when the two blind men went out, there was a group that brought him a donkey, his inhabitant being a devil.
Jesus cast out the devil and the demon, and he started to speak. The people were amazed and said: "We've never seen anything like this in Israel!"
But the Pharisees said: "He casts out demons by the ruler of demons." Jesus has compassion on the people.
And Jesus went around the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing all kinds of diseases and pains among the people.
When he saw that people felt sorry for them because they were worried and tired like sheep that have no shepherd.
He told his students: "The harvest is abundant, but the reaping is little."
Then ask the master of the harvest to send workers to his harvest.
The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
He called the two students and gave them authority over the possessed spirits to cast them out and to heal people from all diseases and pains.
And these are the names of the apostles: the first one is Simon, whom they call Peter, and his brother Andrew, and James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
And Philips and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew who collect taxes, and Jacob, son of Alphaeus, and Taddaeus.
Simon the Zealot who cares for his country, and Judas Iscariot who will betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent these twelve and commanded them: "Do not go into the territory of the Gentiles or enter any city of the Samaritans,
Then they went to look for the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as you go, proclaim and say that the kingdom of the heavens has come near.
Heal the patients, evaluate the deceased, heal the lepers, clear the streets. You took for free, give for free.
Do not shake gold, silver, or copper in your purses.
Neither a bag nor a dress, nor sandals nor a stick, because the servant deserves his meal.
And any city or village you enter, look for someone who deserves to let you into their home and stay with them until you leave.
And when you enter the house, greet the people inside.
And if my hopes for this house are worth it, let your peace come upon them; but if they are not worth it, your peace will return to you.
And if anyone does not accept you or does not listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or that city.
I tell you the truth: the situation of the city of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment will be better than the situation of this city! The persecution that will occur (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
I am sending you like sheep in the middle of the wolves, so be alert like the foxes, and proud like the doves.
Be careful, people are just waiting for the right moment to hand you over to the Jewish council, and to whip you in their assemblies.
And you shake for the rulers and kings on my behalf, so you testify before them and before other peoples.
When they greet you, don't think about how you're going to speak or what you're going to say; at that moment, you'll be too late to say what you want to say.
It's not you who are talking, it's your soul that speaks in your way.
The brother is willing to hand his brother over to death, the father to his son, and the children search for their parents and kill them.
And all the people will hate you because of my name. But those who prove themselves to others will be rewarded.
And when they persecute you in a city, flee to another city. I tell you the truth: they will not finish going through the cities of Israel all before I, the Son of Man, come.
The student is not greater than his teacher, and the servant is not greater than his master.
The student is enough for him to be like his teacher and the servant like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, then what will they call his family?» Fear of God (Luke 12:2-7)
So don't be afraid of them. There's nothing hidden that won't be revealed, and there's nothing concealed that won't be known.
Tell it to you in the dark, say it in the light. And what is whispered to you softly in your ears, call it out from above the rooftops.
And do not fear when they kill the body and cannot kill the soul, but fear when He is able to destroy both the soul and the body in hell.
Hey, aren't two birds sold for a franc? And they don't fall to the ground unless there's a sky-high warning about them.
Your entire head hair is counted.
Don't be afraid, you are better than many birds!
So whoever confesses to people, I will also confess to my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before people, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the world (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
Don't think that I came to bring peace to the land; I didn't come to bring peace, but a sword.
I want to distinguish between the boy and his father, the girl and her mother, and the wife and her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man are to be his hopes.
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me does not deserve me. And whoever loves his son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
Whoever does not carry his cross and follow me does not deserve me.
Whoever wins his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it." The reward (Mark 9:36-41)
Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me.
Whoever accepts, I want him to accept for the sake of Allah so that he may earn the reward of a prophet. And whoever accepts a righteous man for the sake of Allah so that he may earn the reward of a righteous man.
He even gives those little ones a glass of cold water for free for my sake, my student. I tell you the truth, his effort is not wasted.
Disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus finished, he instructed his twelve disciples, then he went from that place to teach and preach in the towns in that region.
And John heard in prison about the works of the Messiah, so he sent his disciples to him.
They said: "Are you the one coming, or are we waiting for someone else?"
Jesus answered them: "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard,"
Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind will see, the lame will walk, those with leprosy will be healed, the deaf will hear, the dead will rise, and the poor will be blessed with the gospel.
And what is the point of someone who doesn't doubt!
When John’s disciples went away, Jesus began to speak to the people about John and said: "What did you go out to see in the wilderness? A reed shaken by the wind?"
So what are you going out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? Those are the ones who wear expensive clothes in kings' palaces!
So, what are you going out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, and I tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Malachi 3:1; Mark 1:2 This is what is written about him in the Bible: "Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
I tell you the truth, none of those born of women is greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until today, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing forcefully, and the strong are seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
And if you want to believe, it's Elijah who will come.
He who has ears, let him hear!
Bishnawa, do we resemble this generation? They are like kids sitting in the market and shouting at each other:
We have celebrated you and you did not dance, and we mourned for you and you did not cry.
John the Baptist neither eats nor drinks, and you say: "He has a demon."
Come, Son of Man, we eat food and drink wine. You said: "Here is a reckless and drunken man who associates with those who collect taxes and sinners." But wisdom is justified by her children." The cities that did not repent (Luke 10:13-15)
And from afar, Jesus began to rebuke the cities where He performed His great miracles, because they did not repent.
And he said: "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the great miracles that were performed among you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, wearing sackcloth and sitting on ashes."
But I tell you: the situation of the cities of Tyre and Sidon will be better than yours on the Day of Judgment.
And you, O Capernaum! Are you going to the sky? You're heading down to the abyss. Because if the great miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you: the condition of the land of Sodom will be better than your condition on the Day of Judgment." Jesus rejoices (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at that time and said: "Thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and understanding, and revealing them to the little children."
Yes, indeed, Dad, that was your will.
Dad gave me everything. And no one knew that the son was the father, and no one knew that the father was the son, and everyone chose the son to show him to him.
Eijouli, you are tired and carrying a heavy load, and I will rest you.
Shake my hand and learn from me; I am kind and my heart is humble, and soon you will find peace within yourselves.
My side is not steady, and my burden is light.
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time, Jesus was walking in the midst of the wheat on Saturday, and his disciples were hungry. So they began to pluck the heads of grain and eat.
But when they saw the Pharisees doing that, they told him: "Look! Your disciples are doing something unlawful to be done on the Sabbath."
# I Samuel 21:1-6; No. 24:9 Jesus said to them: "Brothers, haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?"
How did he enter the house of my Lord, and eat the bread of the offering, which he and those with him did not have permission to eat? Was it lawful for the priests to eat it?
# Numbers 28:9-10 My brother, didn't you read in the Law how the priests in the temple break the Sabbath commandment on the Sabbath day, and no one blames them?
But I tell you: there is one here greater than the temple.
# Hosea 6:6; Matthew 9:13 And if you knew what this verse means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." Then you wouldn't judge, and no one would be blamed.
Here I am, the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.» The man with the withered hand is healed (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11)
And Jesus went to that place and entered their synagogue.
And there was a man there with a paralyzed hand. Then people asked him: "Is it permissible for someone to be healed on Saturday?" so they could find something to accuse him of.
Jesus said to them: "Which of you, having one sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not go and pull it out?"
And how much is a person worth compared to a donkey! So that's why it's permissible to do good on Saturday.
And when Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" the man stretched it out, and it was restored, whole like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired how to kill Jesus. Jesus is the servant whom God chose.
And Jesus recognized this thing and went to that place. Many people followed him, and he healed them all.
And he ordered them not to tell anyone about him.
And this thing happened as the Prophet Isaiah said:
# Isaiah 42:1-4 Here is my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.
He doesn't work or shout, and no one on the streets hears his voice.
A sickly cane that cannot be broken, and a wick that cannot be extinguished. Until justice prevails.
And the peoples will have hope in His name. Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at that time, they brought him a blind man and a mute who was possessed by a demon. Jesus healed him, and he began to speak and see.
And all the people were amazed and said: "Is this really the son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said: "He is casting out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
And Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or house divided against itself cannot stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, so that his kingdom is divided against itself, how then will his kingdom stand?
And if we go out in the neighborhoods with Belsaboul, who will your students go out with? That's why they are the ones who will judge you.
But if I go out in the streets with the Spirit of God, then surely the kingdom of God has taken control of you.
And how can someone enter a strong man's house and steal his belongings, unless the shoulder of the strong man was initially there, and then he can steal the things in his house?
Who is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
That's why I tell you, all of people's sins and disbelief will be forgiven them, but disbelief in the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
And anyone who says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the age to come." The tree and its fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
Either let the tree be good and its fruit good. Or let the tree be bad and its fruit bad. The tree is known by its fruit.
Oh children of Al-Lafa'i, how can you say good words while you are wicked? The tongue speaks what is in the heart.
The good person brings out good things from the treasure in his heart, and the bad person brings out bad things from his bad heart.
I tell you: every empty word people say will be held against them on the Day of Judgment.
With your words, you appear innocent, and with your words, you are judged. The Pharisees ask for a miracle (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
At that time, some of the scribes of the Jews and the Pharisees said to Jesus: "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
But he replied to them: "An evil and sinful generation seeks a miracle, but no miracle will be granted to them except the miracle of Prophet Yunus."
# Jonah 1:17 And just as Jonah remained three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so too I, the Son of Man, will remain three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Jonah 3:5 The people of Nineveh believed in God; they declared a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.
# I Matthew 10:1-10; II John 9:1-12 And the Queen of the South will rise up in judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, someone greater than Solomon here!» The return of the possessed spirit (Luke 11:24-26)
When the possessed soul leaves a person, it moves through places without water, searching for comfort, but it doesn't find even a place.
This time he says: "I will go back to my house from which I left." And he returns to find it empty, clean, and organized.
Yuli walks and brings with him seven other worse spirits, and they enter into this man and dwell in him, and his condition becomes worse than it was before. And thus, this will also happen to this wicked generation.» Mother of Jesus and His brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
And while Jesus was still talking to the people, his mother and brothers came and stood outside wanting to speak with him.
Someone said to him: "Your mother and your brothers are outside wanting to talk to you."
But he answered the man who spoke to him: "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
He extended his hand towards his students and said: "Here they are, my mother and my brothers."
Whoever has the will of my father in heaven is my brother, sister, and mother.
Like the farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out to the lake that day with his hand and sat beside the lake.
And many people gathered around him, until he boarded a boat, and everyone stood on the shore.
And he told them many things with proverbs: "The farmer went out to plant."
And when he was planting, some seeds fell into the ditch, and the birds came and ate them.
There is another seed that fell on a land with stones, not much soil, and it grew quickly because its soil wasn't rich.
But when the sun rises, she burns and dries up because she has no veins.
And another branch fell into the middle of the thorns, and the thorns grew and choked it.
And there is another seed that fell into good soil and brought forth abundant fruit, some brought water once as much as they planted, some brought sixty, and some brought thirty.
Whoever has ears, let him hear!» Why does Jesus speak in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered them: "You are given the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they are not given to them."
He who has, so that he can have more and become abundant. But he who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.
That's why I speak to them in proverbs because they are blind and do not see, hear, or understand.
# Isa ‏6:9-10; Mark ‏8:18; John ‏12:39-41; Acts ‏28:26-27 The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in them, which says: You will hear but never understand, and you will see but never perceive.
This people have hardened their hearts, closed their ears, and shut their eyes, so they won't see with their eyes, hear with their ears, or understand with their hearts, and they will return to me so I can heal them.
But you, my eyes are healthy because they see, and my ears are healthy because they hear.
I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous men wished to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it." Interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
So listen, what is meant by "like the farmer":
Whenever anyone hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart; this is what was sown along the path.
But you plant in the land where there are stones; it is the one who hears the word and accepts it at once, and is happy.
But he has no veins inside him, he waits a little, and when the tough time or persecution for the word comes, he falls at the right time.
But planting in the midst of thorns is what makes the word heard, as the worries of the world and the love of wealth suffocate the word and turn it into no seed at all.
But you plant in the rich soil, it’s the one who hears the word and understands it, and brings a lot of seed, and then there are those who bring as much water as they plant, and one others sixty, and another thirty. » Like the wheat.
And Jesus said to them, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But when the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.
And when the seedlings sprouted and the wheat grew, the darnel came up with it.
And the servants of the landowner came and said to him: "Our master, is it not that you planted good seeds in your land? So where did the weeds come from?"
He told them: "One of my enemies did this thing." The servants asked him: "So do you want us to go and gather the wheat?"
But he said: "No, so you don't uproot the wheat while you're gathering the barley."
Leave the wheat and the spelt to grow together until the time of harvest, and at that time I will tell the harvesters to gather the spelt first and make bundles so they can be burned, but the wheat should be gathered and stored in my granaries."» Like the mustard seed and the yeast (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And He gave them another example, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field."
She is the smallest of all the seedlings, but when she grew up, she became larger than all the greenery, and became a tree, to the point that the birds of the sky come and nest in it.
He also said another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all of it was leavened."
This whole thing Jesus told people in parables. And he didn't tell them anything without a parable.
# Proverbs 78:2 This thing was going to happen, as the prophet said: "He will speak to my mouth in parables, and I will reveal hidden secrets when the world was created." Explanation of the parable of the wheat.
At that time, Jesus left the people and entered the house, and his disciples came to him and asked, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds."
Answer them: "The one who sows the beautiful seed is I, the Son of Man,"
And the crop is the world, and the beautiful seed is the children of the kingdom of God, and the tare is the children of the wicked one.
And the enemy they planted is Hell, and the harvest is the end of times, and the harvesters are the angels.
Exactly as the flax gathers and burns in the fire, so it will happen at the end of times.
Anna, the Son of Man, so I can send my angels, and they will gather the wicked and those who do evil from my kingdom.
They throw them into the middle of the fire, the one who will cry and the years will be wasted.
And at that time, the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Lord. Whoever has ears, let him hear! » Like treasure, diamond, and net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure in a field, which a man found and hid again; then in his joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant searching for precious gems.
He found a piece of precious gold, went and sold everything he had, and bought it.
The kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea, gathering many kinds of fish.
When they finished, the fishermen took them to the shore, sat down, and put the good fish in boxes, while they threw away the bad.
And so it will happen in the end times: the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
They throw them into the middle of the fire, and the one who will cry and lament the passing years. The new and the old
And Jesus said to his disciples: "Brothers, did you understand all this?" They answered: "Yes, we did."
And he said to them: "That is why every scribe who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure new things and old."
And when Jesus finished this parable, he went away from that place.
And so he began to teach them in their assembly, and they were amazed and said: "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?"
My brother, isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't her name Mary? And aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
And aren't all his sisters girls with us? So where did this man get all this from?
And that's how they used to complain about him. Then Jesus told them: "A prophet is honored everywhere, in every place, whether in his homeland or his own house."
He didn't perform many miracles because they didn't believe in him.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, King Herod heard about Jesus.
And he said to his servants: "This is John the Baptist risen from the dead; that's why he is performing miracles."
And before Herod, John the Baptist was arrested, bound, and imprisoned because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
Because John told them: "It's forbidden for you to take it."
And they wanted to kill him, as the people feared for their sake because they thought John was a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, Herodias's daughter danced at the party, and Herod was pleased.
That's why he promised her and swore to give her anything she asked for.
And her mother’s insistence, she said to Herod: «Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!»
And the king was sad, as he ordered to delay what he loved about her, because of the oath he swore and the guests.
And someone sent, beheaded John in prison
They brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, then took it to his mother.
And John's disciples came and took his body, buried it, and went to tell Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand men (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14).
When Jesus heard about this, he left that place in a boat and went to a place where no one was. But when the people heard about it, they followed him on foot from the city.
When the boat docked, he saw many people, so he felt sorry for them and treated their patients.
In the evening, his students came to him and said: "The day is over, and this place is empty. Send people to go to the villages and buy something to eat."
Jesus said: "They don't need to go. You give them something to eat."
They told him: "We only have five loaves and two fish."
Jesus said: "Bring them here to me."
And he ordered the people to sit on the grass, took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to the sky, blessed them, divided the loaves, and gave them to the students, and the students gave them to the people.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they carried away twelve baskets full of leftovers.
And the people who ate were about five thousand men, not including women and children. Jesus walks on water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21).
Then exactly after that, I ordered his students to get on the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite side of the lake until he sends people to go.
And after the people left, he went up alone to the mountain to pray. And after the sun set, the one going was alone.
But at that time, the boat was very far from the shore and was overwhelmed by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
And before dawn, Jesus came to them walking on the water.
But the students were frightened when they saw him walking on water and said: "This is a hallucination!" and they started screaming out of fear.
But Jesus spoke to them at that time and said, "Take courage. I am here, do not be afraid!"
And Peter answered: "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said: "Come." Then Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to Jesus.
But the wind was strong, and he was afraid, so he started to drown, and he shouted: "Oh Lord, save me!"
At that moment, Jesus stretched out his hand and said: "You with weak faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they set out in the boat, the wind calmed down.
And in the boat, they worshiped Him and said: "Truly, You are the Son of God!" Jesus heals people with many diseases (Mark 6:53-56).
And Jesus and his disciples arrived at that place, which is in the region of Genessaret.
And when the people of this land knew Jesus, they spread the news about Him throughout the entire region and brought Him all the sick people.
And they asked him to let them touch even the tip of his beard. And when they touched it, they all felt relief.
The traditions of the ancestors (Mark 7:1-13)
And the Pharisees and the scribes of the Jews came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and they said:
Why don't your students respect the elders' customs? And why don't they wash their hands when they eat?
Tell them: "Why don't you obey God's command and are you really sticking to your customs?"
# Ex 20:12; Deut 5:16; Ex 21:17; Lev 20:9 God said: "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death."
But you say if someone tells his father or his mother: "The help I gave you, I have given to God; he is not obliged to honor his father."
And thus you have rendered the word of God invalid according to your customs.
O hypocrites, Isaiah truly prophesied and said about you:
# Isaiah 29:13 This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
They worship falsehood and teach in the commandments of men.» What defiles a person (Mark 7:14-23)
And Jesus called the people and said to them: "Hear and understand."
It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.
And his students came and said to him: "Hey, do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Tell them: "Every tree that my father didn't plant in the sky will be uprooted."
Stay away from them! They are blind leading the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
But Peter said: "Explain this parable to us."
And Jesus said: "My brother, you still don't understand?"
My brother, haven't you noticed that anything that goes into the mouth goes straight to the stomach, and then comes out of the body?
But the need that comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and that is what corrupts a person.
Evil thoughts, murder, fornication, corruption, theft, perjury, and disbelief come to the heart.
These are the ones that defile a person. But food with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24-30)
And Jesus went from that place to Tyre and Sidon.
And the woman from Canaan came from that region and shouted: "Sir, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is possessed by a demon, and she suffers greatly."
But he didn't answer her a single word. His students came and begged him, saying: "Give her what she wants, let her leave us alone, she's following us and shouting!"
Jesus answered: "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But she came down and sat on her heels in front of him and said: "Sir, help me!"
And he replied: "It's not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! Even the dogs eat the leftovers that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered her: "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you according to your desire." And immediately her daughter was healed. Jesus heals many people.
And Jesus walked from there and crossed over the shore of the Sea of Galilee, went up the mountain, and sat down.
Many people came and brought with them paralyzed people, the sick, the blind, the deaf, and many others, and they placed them in front of his feet, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed that the beggars were speaking, and the lame were walking, and the blind could see. And they praised the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10).
And Jesus called his disciples and said to them: "The people are hungry for me, because they have been with me for three days without eating. I don't want to send them away hungry, so they don't faint on the way."
The students asked: "How are we going to get bread in this wilderness? Will it be enough for all these people?"
And Jesus said to them: "How many loaves do you have?" They said: "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the people to sit on the ground,
He took the seven loaves and the fish fins, thanked God, divided them, and gave them to the students; the students gave them to the people.
And they all ate until they were full, and they carried away what was left over in seven large, full baskets.
There were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
And after the people left, he went up in the boat and headed to the Mijdal area.
Signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
And Jesus answered them: "When evening comes, say: 'The weather is good because the sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say: "There is rain today, because the sky is dark red." You know how to interpret the sky's condition, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of the times.
A wicked and sinful generation seeking a miracle, but no miracle will be granted to them except the miracle of Jonah." He left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
When the students reached the opposite shore, they forgot to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them: "Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
The students discussed among themselves and said: "That's because we don't have bread."
But Jesus knew this and said: "You of little faith, why are you arguing among yourselves and saying: We have no bread?"
My brother, you still don't understand? Don't you remember the five loaves that were divided among the five thousand, and how many large baskets were left over afterward?
And the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets did you fill?
How can you not understand that I am not talking about bread? Be careful of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!
At that time, they understood that he told them to beware of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not the leaven of bread. Peter testifies that Jesus is the Messiah (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say I am, the Son of Man?"
They asked him: "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say you are Elijah, others say you are Jeremiah, and no one says you are one of the prophets."
He asked them: "So, who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
And Jesus said: "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! Flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven."
And I tell you: You are Peter, which means a large stone, and on this stone I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And at that time, he advised his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Christ. Jesus first announces his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27).
And at that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes of the Jews, be killed, and on the third day rise again.
But Peter shook Jesus on the side and started blaming him and said: "God forbid, Lord! This thing can't possibly happen to you at all!"
But Jesus turned and said to Peter: "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you are thinking not as God does, but as humans do."
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wants to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
The one who wants to spend his life loses it, and the one who loses his life for my sake will win it.
What is the benefit of a person if they gain the whole world and lose their life? Or what is the thing that a person sacrifices their life for?
I am the Son of Man so that I may come with my angels in my Father's glory, and at that time I will reward each person according to what they have done.
I tell you the truth: some of those standing here are not here to see death before they see me. I, the Son of Man, am coming in my kingdom.
Jesus reveals His glory to His disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and went up alone with them to a high mountain.
And they changed before them, their faces shining like the sun, and their garments turned white like the light.
And the next day, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will put up three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very scared.
But Jesus came and touched them and said: "Get up, do not be afraid."
And when they lifted their eyes, they saw only Jesus himself.
And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them: "Tell no one about the vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And the students asked him: "Then why does the Jewish book say that Elijah must come first?"
Tell them: "Indeed, Elijah is coming to restore all things."
But I am transferring you to Elias, and they didn't recognize him, but everyone did whatever they wanted with him. And I, the Son of Man, will also suffer at their hands.
And at that time, the students understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
And when Jesus and His disciples came to the people, a man approached and fell on his knees before Jesus and said:
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son; for his sake, he suffers greatly and is constantly falling into the fire and water.
And I brought it for your students, but they can't see it.
And Jesus answered and said: "Oh, faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me!"
And Jesus cast out the demon, and they came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.
At that time, the students came to Jesus on the side and said: "Why couldn't we cast him out?"
He told them: "Because of your weak faith! I tell you the truth, if you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there!' and it would move, and nothing would be impossible for you."
# 17:21 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: As for this type, it only comes out through prayer and fasting. Jesus once again speaks about His death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
When the students were gathered in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "I, the Son of Man, will be handed over to the hands of people,"
And they will kill me and I will rise on the third day." Are you worried a lot? Jesus pays the temple taxes.
They went to Capernaum, where they collected the temple tax, and they approached Peter and said to him: "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Answer: "Yes, indeed." And when he went home, Jesus preceded him with words and said: "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs and taxes? From their children or from foreigners?"
Peter said: "From the foreigners." Jesus said: "No, the local children are free."
But we don't want to cause them trouble, go to the lake and cast your fishing line, and catch the big fish that appears first. When you open its mouth, you'll find a silver coin enough to pay for both of us. Take it and pay my taxes and yours.
