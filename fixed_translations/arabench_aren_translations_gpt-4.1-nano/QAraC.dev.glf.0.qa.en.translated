I am saying the words you don't want to understand, O Saleh.
Any problems, Saleh, open your mind, open your mind, the world around you, the people around you, what are you doing, what is the world doing?
He is my uncle's brother.
And those who do not want to develop themselves and improve those around them
Oh Saleh, don't get a big head.
No no no no, I don't care about you.
And she walks on the road
And two dates, cut in half.
And you are dead, Malioe.
Eat or don't eat
No eating
Yes, human, I agree
This rail, I don't know where he's living.
He is with him
This is our chance, I swear. Our cars are old and their models are disappointing.
Try yourself, try with him later, and whoever greets you.
These are normal and well-known matters.
The bull, but only the one without a personality
Yes, indeed, I'm afraid.
I'm the one who hurts my liver, mom.
The budget is in his hand
What is this project that he's in charge of?
Government project Akbeer
Underneath it and you don't show
I have the right to take
You are in one ministry and he is in another ministry.
Why did you forget, Mom?
Day in the garage
It means me
I consider myself a contributor with them
Nothing happens; nothing comes out for me unless it's the project. Wow.
And I have nothing.
So that means I am a shareholder now.
We all should take it
This is a government project
He finally understands this bull, kid.
I am negotiating with him.
Goodness is coming to kick you.
This is a government project
And this is your chance
Like your oil, it doesn't slip.
Tray of goodness in front of you
Take your bite and put it in your throat
Ariel Macan in the hideout
I heard it with my own ears.
He tells you about the government projects he knows.
and one-third suction
His son, Saloum
Going to Souq Waqif
The one fan has eighteen aerials
Put it in the budget
Eighty-one riyals each, one hundred
They said we didn't do anything.
Celebrating with him
Seek refuge from Iblis
Oh, I just feel like his head is starting to tilt a little.
God willing, my Lord
He is the head of the committee and everything is under his control.
The most important thing, don't forget us
We are your quarter
And it means that we have to be together.
And this government project is an opportunity
Of course, Ali
And we cannot do without you
What do you want us to advise you, O Ali?
And God willing, everyone who is part of the project team.
This is definitely something.
Last night, the guys and I were just hanging out.
We are on your side.
All project committee members are reassured
Concerned about the benefit of this committee chairman
They say that
I bring you good news, O Ali
And reassure the group
Honestly, really, Abu Fahad
May Allah bring you good news, but you didn't tell me.
Then don't forget, Saout.
No no
God willing, things will go as smoothly as possible.
He agrees with this ailment, Saleh.
Good for you
My mother is between the right and the left.
It means "it happens" or "it becomes."
As long as you're with us in the department, it means you're contributing to the project with us.
But the most important thing is that the matter is between us.
A little of the tray of rice and meat in front of you
I must eat
Enjoy and stay healthy
Is the
So, every now and then, I'll go out like this.
We won't finish
In this situation, we will never finish.
Or any inquiry as well.
We are helpless and unable to help.
How do we take our share
No way, really?
What should we write about him?
Later, it's not just us who will take it.
Everyone who contributed to the project deserves their right.
Why not
No more fear, Saleh
We are the ones who set the budget
And he bought the land today and registered it in his name.
Find her later
He says he won't buy it.
Where are you from, bringing this talk?
Connected with me today
He tells me to call your brother Amaskar on the phone.
He killed him good.
Your brother reached faster.
You see the second earth
The land I bought for him yesterday.
They agreed to sell it.
Tell him to call him and say that if he wants it, just register it in his name.
He wants to impress her with his words.
And our right
And we consider ourselves partners with him
Even if we are not contributors
I will swallow it and spit it out in your face.
Your arrogance diminishes your brother's rights and your mother's rights with you.
I can't come to you.
We are also shareholders in the project, and it is our right to claim our rights.
Say it, say it
That’s true, yesterday when Sultan came and asked him, he refused.
But I didn't leave him.
And he is mistaken if he does not allocate a sum for the project to them.
First stage
You are no less than anyone else.
Members of the committee with him
I hear him talking to them on the phone
They are entering with their brothers and friends
I know that this government project is a dead end.
We don't want a fixed amount and to leave.
Financial correspondence
If my brother Sultan wants to attend the meetings with us, he can.
Because the members of the committee
Project Budget
But the only requirement
You haven't fallen short.
May God bless you, O Allah, and keep you safe, with Saleh.
Your brother-in-law
Do you like it?
He is serving us on the project
Let me mention some things
We distributed the tasks fairly
You, O Saleh
And I am near the lime, bricks, and concrete.
And the rest of the things are electricity and water, they didn't leave it for me.
Hey guys
Determine your share
I swear to God, I am
Sometimes I say a fixed amount.
And sometimes I say
I make it a percentage
It's not a problem, Saleh, it's not a problem
Take what you want and the way you want.
The most important thing
So, we're also here
Icon this week
Everyone can set the amount they wish.
For example
After a while, he took a deep breath.
He wants an additional hundred thousand.
Hey, why, I mean, huh?
And what do you all think?
I'm with you
Even after the shareholders
They brought you your loot, your work is done, no worries.
You have orphaned lawful earnings
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, increase the budget, increase it.
You look very beautiful, Mashallah.
What is this?
What is this? This is Abu Mal's project, you know.
Oh Sultan
Oh Sultan, oh your brother
So, it is considered a contributor, right?
This is the last name
Saud, your friend, how many names did he put?
Eid, Eid, Asmaa, Ayyoul, Khnfa'ahum
Alright, should I put it in any group for the percentage or the fixed amount?
Don't put it with the tray.
When you put it for him, put it for him, meaning give him twenty thousand.
Oh, come on
Even in the note here, it says
One of the children of our neighborhood
But this Saud for his list exceeded Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be included in the first phase budget
That's why you don't get lucky.
Hey, Baji, the list that my mother gave me.
The one who calls every two hours and adds people as she pleases
God bless her with a long life, haha haha
My eye's view of my child
And whoever surrenders to you, she is sick, poor, and helpless.
She has nothing again this time.
Oh, God, may He guide you. I only found this one, but it's the last one.
Tell him his arm is torn.
Hey, how many seconds does this moment last?
A camel is enough for me: a liver, a shelter, and a hospital.
It means eighty-eight thousand riyals.
How many times have you been pregnant?
Only you, my dear, are precious to me
Oh God, guide you, put her name on the list.
Hosseina, oh Hosseina, daughter of Ahlal
Then you give it to her from your pocket.
Reassure him and tell him that from the second stage, nothing remains.
Eighty-eight thousand
Oh, good boy, they are putting a new heart in her.
Tell him, tell him to let Yazeed buy me more than two thousand to buy gifts for the girls.
I say to you two thousand
A thousand and a hundred for me
O Hussainah, daughter of Ahlal
I can flirt with your friends.
No, mother
But I have a lot of work.
I'll talk to you later, later.
That's why more people are eating from the tray.
The infrastructure can withstand.
Don't forget about me, okay?
Write the number you want.
I don't know anymore
You and your conscience
I am the chairman of the management council
And I say you deserve the million
They will decide tomorrow; the project will start.
And they will come down, God willing, the installments for us will start immediately.
I want to know how much.
Once, they will give us everything, or in installments.
Why does she matter more than us?
In the match, there's suction. The important thing is to stay silent; we're now waiting for the committee, and they will come.
Yallah said Yallah Yallah said you all be quiet, meaning be quiet
You really have no shame or imagination.
If I hear one voice among you
Cutting the tongue cut
Oh, long live the group
So, this is still money, not just like that.
Before, it was a lot.
fifty million
Did you cook the ginger oil a little?
In the end, you are the president
We don't want head pain
We approve the budget
Through your talk about the project, Mr. Saleh, it is noticeable that the project is vital and also important.
And this, may God keep you safe, is not just for this generation.
Yes yes
Tomorrow is the opening of the project's second phase.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you.
And I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations
Where is the Eudona Eudona project?
So, where are we?
Where are we, I wonder?
What kind of situation is this?
You didn't see the officials speaking, and the people clapped for them.
We are at the official opening, Ashfej
So, you mean now you're going for Hajj, meaning we're in the project.
Oh, we are in the project
And people of Arqata are pouring down
And this box, I don't know what they put it for.
There's no work for me in the box.
This honesty, may God bless you, the infrastructure
The official opening of the global beaches
Ashfeej for the third episode
I swear I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, thank God, arrogance is ugly.
John, tell me, do you know why they took me away?
But he stopped his car
I was surprised by this.
But when she told me
No one has brought me anything.
I saw her myself, and she is proud of her size.
Thank God you're comfortable.
And you are sitting comfortably at home.
Why harm, no, Dad, don't let anyone play with my head, oh Lady Munira.
Ahmadi Rabaj, O Munira, you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
They are afraid for your share and invest it for you.
There is a deep hole, my friend, Hissa
Her brothers do not give her an Ariel from her father's share.
We don't know these stories.
This is a legitimate right
This is a matter of trust; you don't trust us.
I don't know how.
I didn't like what my brother Rashed said.
He goes and responds to this check that they give me every three months
Alright, this is mine.
He keeps telling me everything
You don't trust us.
Inheritance and money talks require clarity.
And as long as you are my father, I am not comfortable.
You know what you're doing to people
And this is M. Salameen with you, the poor girl.
I can't believe she is a millionaire heir.
He/she insulted his/her brothers
Aflous destroys the world
But the truth is the truth, and this is the law of Allah.
And then, I mean
And we are managing the company
And we invest in lands, real estate, and money.
No problems and no headaches
Are you saying she was walking towards the land in the desert?
It's too much for her.
To record her reel after the story
What a story
Your sister has started to pick her nose.
This is the story.
She plans to tell us stories.
It's enough for us to give her money.
Hawk, calm down.
We need to find a solution for us, Rasheed.
In my head
What is this?
My share from inheriting my father
Those who donate to me every three months
Everything is known
Forty thousand, nothing has changed
They don't even invest their money.
Hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow
Why then afterward
It doesn't need much thinking
They said to add more so she would be happy and stay silent.
Your entire speech is correct.
They are just giving me in the train.
If I see their women
Diamonds, sets of shapes and colors
And I swear I can't live until half of their life.
They consider my father's lawful possessions as a burden on me.
My argument
This is your right.
According to Sharia and law
I feel that they are ignoring me and neglecting me.
I'm no longer comfortable with their way.
By God, Mom, I don't know what's happening to me in this world.
They beat me, they hurt me, oh mother
They don't know that there is a reckoning and punishment.
And Allah will punish them for eating forbidden money.
And bear with me, Mom, I will bring up the issue of the courts to them.
By God, they are breeding.
Is it because we increased, or because our population grew?
That's why I tell you, oh Mom
Here a little
Everyone has a building; you would say skyscrapers.
I only have my right
My father, I want my son to build a mosque before I die.
And I want to donate to this poor person
Alright, Mom Umm Salameen
Let Sadej stay in your belly, Mom.
And I do not clarify for them the course of the courts
And I do not take it as invalid
Do you know why
In this time
She deserves it
Come, ask the accountant
You are the one asking the accountant.
Reply to them
Oh, no, no, I mean, God bless you, I came because of your sister.
The door I entered from
Don't mess with yourself
Pointing to the door you leaned on.
No no
No Falcon
Saad Haram
Lighten up, don't make nonsense.
Your share in the company and real estate is clear; we have no objection.
six hundred thousand
Her long life is silent
Sure, this is her sister's reel.
And your sister is kind.
I am gathering a base from them.
A known and specified lawful share
Tell me, do you take 600,000 or 560,000, disaster?
They are forbidden for them
Expect anything, O Manira
My father's company
Eight buildings
Non-urban land and houses
Tell me six hundred thousand only
And I expect a concession
No, Manira
They mock you and expect you to give up. If you can endure this, I will tell you.
You have the right, my father, to know everything about the land and money; they don't understand.
But the company
You are a partner with them
Now they are firing you from the company.
I tell you, no one can stop me
Find out what it is
Abouk Company is
You don't see her bothering.
Inside I tell you let me go in
There is no need for that.
He has some papers, I don't know what they are.
Come, extend your tongue over us, cut my tongue.
We are sorry
My brother Saad and Saqr are coming into my office; I will explain to them because they don't know what the matter is.
Come on in
Look at brother Nasser, what he's drinking
And they went to him, may God bless you.
Nothing but T T T T T
Tell us a story
He discovers how much she has.
He discovers that she has four hundred thousand, not forty.
Let's count it together.
Ninety-six months
And this story I hit it in three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
It's okay, good, bird, I mean.
He hits his head in the flood
I thank him and tell him
This is our money
All the youth are like this, inherited.
Hello to those who come to forgive us, forgive us. The company, your company, only brought goodness.
We are present
This accountant Samir is present
Whatever Nasser brother wants, he will get it.
The entire company is at your service
You want to come in and take your time, no rush, don't ask about anything.
Only your shame holds you back
Shame on you
A trap to catch him
And I searched through all the files
It is supposed to have more than ten million.
And no one urinates on it, not even a stranger
Are you saying she's poor?
Her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they had three lands.
And every land is larger than the other
Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for them, oh my father.
It's forbidden for them what they're doing.
I do not bother them
And what can I do, O Salman?
I have nothing but to sue them in court.
I will fill these two pages for you.
Postpone the issue
Hold on, oh father, oh Nasser
They bring up the court's case.
Oh, really, you're leaving your bed while the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O Ya Salameen
My nation, go to the حجرتج.
And he heals the diseases of the Muslims
He didn't tell me
Sorry, from
Oh, I remembered you, I knew you, I knew you
Yes yes yes yes
Especially what, my brother
No worries, you're welcome.
He is slaughtering now on the day of knowledge about the millions
I think that God willing, this is Abdullah whom you sent to them.
So, he is the friend Rashed Adel.
Does he know him from years ago?
Do you believe, Munira?
Even Abdullah advised me this.
Stay behind them
I and you, you guide them.
Try to take as much from them as you can.
Do you know, Abdullah, what I am telling you?
People don't live seventy or eighty years.
Our courts have been ruling for people living on a hundred and twenty years.
May Umm Salim, may Allah have mercy on her.
May God have mercy on her, she used to say
The population number has not reached four hundred thousand.
And the issue takes ten years and more.
They must give us a break so we can review the courts.
This is it
Hey boy, you're with them.
May God grant you success, God willing.
You are an old friend from school days.
This world is not worth it.
And I am coming to you with good news
And you, MashaAllah, come from a well-known and large family.
and the children of Asal
Afa, Ya Rashid, we are a quarter.
Do it for the sake of kindness
And don't speak, you're talking now.
Come on, come on, enough of this nonsense, a quarter, not a quarter
Are you standing up or what now?
He bought a set for ninety-nine thousand from the jewelry exhibition.
Where is she from?
They are stealing money from their women
And they deprived his sister of her lawful rights
Do you still have hope, Nasser?
You argued and fought with you
Yesterday when I spoke to him at the mosque
Leave me as I told you.
Famous Arabs and well-known people
Maybe yes or no
But I will say later
O Allah, make our gathering blessed with these luminous faces.
O Allah, illuminate our hearts with what is good for our religion and our worldly life.
Listen, you
Do you have another topic besides the topic of my sister's inheritance?
He reproached him.
Go, Lala, don't be lazy.
It's nothing to me about you
I've been begging and pleading with you for months, and you're just being stubborn.
No, I don't mind you.
I'm going to court early in the morning
Hollow, hollow
Hello, hello
You don't have to worry about it
You are not going to court tomorrow.
Back, wait, back, wait
To give you a chance to see what you're doing
Goodbye
They only listen with the red eye
And if I hear them, I will be harmed
Come on, let me see what they decide.
Saad, tomorrow tell me you're busy
You are planning to go and complain about us in court.
I will delay it for her, but only until tomorrow, and then we will go to her.
What is this?
May God bless your tongue
You told me, what is his right?
Then you go to court and complain about us.
So you can take your share of the inheritance
She said
Your world is the sweetest
Your world was distinguished
Why did I tell you to come back tomorrow?
As soon as you arrive at the courthouse building, park your car in the parking lot.
Jowfeen is a safety and security device.
You go up to the eighth floor
This role involves the judiciary.
Lawyer cards in the country
You definitely need them.
Come on, don't mock us here.
We want her to sue us in court.
My soul, the court
Enlighten my hearing
And you are expecting us to make a concession
She was there
Delinej al-tariq
Delinej al-tariq
We walk, my brother
I forgot to give my sister Munira something important.
This is today's Al-Rayah newspaper.
There is a good article in it
Only the apparent writer is a doctor
My beige hollow one is a gift from An.
Let him get out of the situation he's living in.
Forbidden, I swear by God
He has four children and a house like the others do not have.
No one blames him for putting those around him down and aside.
Poor adventurer in this project
The one I never expected to do business with is Abu Walid.
Eat, eat, the children of the new merchant, Abu Walid
My beloved, do you want me to put something for you?
No, no, no, no
Alright, you get up, get moving, I'll get you some fruits, fruits.
Mom, I want the game that Hamoud has.
Enjoy and health, enjoy and health
Mama Walid, get up and put some sweetness for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Walid. You deserve it.
Managing the quarter for me, an excellent accountant
Thank you, thank you, sir
Dad, we have become big traders. I want you to make me a room for myself.
The student has no ambition, only capital.
God willing, I will bring you a BlackBerry from the elders.
Let's forget about your requests
Our situation is like that of ordinary people
Instead of this chaos we're living in
First of all, let's settle the debts we owe, and then things will get better.
Wow, it looks like you're really happy, Abu Walid.
He started eating more than before
A merchant from Quda
My merchant father lives
Blessings of the project
Leave the quarter's right
Your Lord is my refuge. May God keep you safe.
I met one of them, a Japanese guy.
He was on the table and I gave him my place. He gave me a gift catalog.
One dry quarter
Oh, tell me, is there a chance?
Multi-purpose halls
It's always like this.
These halls are on the computer
Knock on the cinema
I want a sports field, yeah
This is magic
They were immediately amazed and agreed.
I paid the bank a little, and from my wife's family a little, and from myself a little, and I sold a piece of land I have, thank God.
You, madam, the committee agreed.
Jan requested the order from the factory since the ministry approved it.
And along the factory, the email
Lynn Yi is calling you
In thyme
There's nothing, I swear. I'm sitting in Ali's office, waiting.
The secretary didn't contact me, brother.
And ten, I am traveling
You and your luck
Now my transaction is complete.
And the committee approved it.
Why do you mean, I don't expect anything to happen to her.
You are not a director at all
Why don't you go there so he can sign for you and we're done?
He killed what was in his hand.
Not all employees are like this.
Everyone is a mercenary in his turban, so you say to the young man with the spear.
Praise your Lord
By God, my brother, I was reviewing them while I was thinking.
Hopefully, it's done.
And this is Abu Fahad, he doesn't know about himself; whenever he attends, it's whenever he feels like it.
Shasawi yakhy
And afterward, he went back to the money.
I need to hurry up and finish the transaction, I swear I don't know what to do.
By God, I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
His praise, his praise, whatever it is
I'm even waiting for Abu Fahd.
Alright, if you're the secretary and you say it like that, what does that mean?
Give me your number
No, the secretary, Lala, sat down. No, the secretary, what's wrong with you?
You're not calling, you scared the group, they freaked out, remember the secretary
We are just waiting for Abu Fahd now.
Daddy, I am in Mali, I want to pray.
This one is free, and this one too
Moment by moment, guys
Calm, calm, shush, calm
Alright, he told you to calm down, just bring it.
Obliged to go to the airport now, Bofhed.
How did it turn out?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, let's catch him at the car, come on.
Snow Musk Hada
May God help you
Wait for Abu Fahd
I don't blame your father, my dear.
But he's way too unnatural
And when the shipment is received
His money is going to him
But now I need it.
Where am I sitting now
What's wrong with you, Shador?
There is something in front of you
Hey, you keep calling late at night, waking me up from sleep.
Dude, I told you
I told you.
My talent is in my hands, O Abu.
Dad, I know, but it can't be done.
Classes start next week at the university
And if I didn't register with them or they didn't accept me, then I'll wait for the next course.
Dad, it's forbidden for me to waste three months.
It means, oh Boug, I am not falling short.
I bring them back every day, I bring them back every day
Look at Bofhed, look at Bofhed
And I am sitting at home.
Man, you don't understand
Only the noon prayer is connected.
This is the fourth time you are calling me.
Man, you don't understand.
I know you need the money.
But God willing, Bofahad will sign the deal this week.
And they pay him the first installment
By God, I don't know what to say to you, my sister.
He woke up startled.
And he walks through the night and talks to himself
And if it does not happen with Wafahd
God protect us
That's why
This week, Boufahad must sign the deal.
Abu Fahd, this is a sign to make the deal happen.
Bo Fahd, I will stay the day
And he travels a year
and neglecting people's interests
Heh heh heh heh, how?
Best times
He sent me two texts
This strange rock pulls me, Aiterni.
What's wrong with it now?
He heard that I am going to review.
Because of my treatment
I will tell you the truth about the employees.
And the deadline is near, I am about to finish.
Give me the phone, give me the phone
With you, Secretary Abu Fahad
And I wanted to tell you
Tomorrow, with Fahad, God willing, I will definitely attend.
As soon as it reaches you
Come to me immediately
With the
Dude, you never looked like this.
Now I am arguing with you
And you're looking at your mobile phone.
I said it's forbidden
At least to feel.
And when you straighten up
I will return your section.
Fifteen cartons of printed materials
Fifteen cartons of printing paper
You're breaking my heart, I swear.
The director is punishing him
Yayba and Wana
I found out about the factory, you.
He loses a large amount if he doesn't complete his transaction today or sign it for him.
When the manager left and went away
Owl, O human
And when the director is asked about him
Don't be afraid, we're handling it, just let him go, I swear it's a shame.
Bo Walid
I'm going, but I'm waiting for a call, God willing.
Oh, human
God help him
Wait, guys, wait, guys, wait
And I wonder why the office comes to take some of the belongings and then leaves.
Wait for Bofaid
Nobody move
Don't sit down
Wait, Abu Fahd
Until I keep going
Wait for Abu Fahd
Wait for Bofhed
Wait for Abu Fahd
Let's go to Ordu in Oz Pakistan

We crawl to you here and millions
Call the hospital quickly
I do not speak the hospital
Wait for Abu Fahd
I have spent my entire life as a correspondent from those years until today.
By God, Omar, oh Abu Saeed
How are you then
He can fight for forty years
And I am a correspondent
Doughnut
Sweat is pouring down because there are no air conditioners like those in the old days.
And you think you're the easy cyclist these days
There is a yellow stamp
By God, you guys are exhausted, Abu Saeed.
Your father is miserable
But what can you do, son of Adam?
Abu Saeed
Come on, forgive us. The director has arrived, so we're going to finish our matters according to his words.
The director has arrived, oh sweet one, let's go
Congratulations, Bousaid
I say your son Khaled is working.
I'm just teasing you.
I did not kill you, God willing.
Dove droppings
I told you, God willing, I will be the last one to graduate from my children with a master's degree.
Graduate and work
Thank God, now I am going to finish my affairs.
I delivered the message perfectly.
Thank God, we didn't fall short. Thank God.
No replacement, O Abu Saeed
And you deserve it
You haven't fallen short, I swear, O Abu Abdulaziz.
You haven't fallen short, I swear, O Abu Abdulaziz.
It is her.
We did what was required of us.
They will also continue the journey.
H K
After this life and fatigue
It’s all just nonsense, nonsense.
You need to rest, oh Abu Saeed
After you left, the lady hosted me here.
On the occasion of retirement
And his cup of coffee and his cigarette, oh Salla
Come back and finish me, your father.
You seem in a hurry for the little bird, Abu Saeed, huh?
And don't worry about it
The knifefish is ready
Yay yay, God willing, I will be at your service. Goodbye.
The sparrow is ready to wait for me, oh dear.
I will finish all the papers for you now, God willing.
Your chance is to take her today
Their manager told me he's traveling
And I have no desire
I don't even feel like moving.
Zain sent someone.
So you're officially considered free
God bless you
Now, I'm finally free to relax.
You haven't fallen short, Abu Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
Bless me, my father
No work
So you're not committed, dude.
Come on, for my sake
Human resources
Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.
Akki Zahro organized a party on the occasion of her son's success
Yayiba cake
My sister, I can't.
My brother, I have a transaction. My father, please finish it for me.
Zahra, don't be upset.
That's enough, Mom.
My father is tired of this work.
God be with him now.
He worked a lot, let him rest now.
Let him rest
He told me to make a small bird.
I fixed it and prepared it.
Antra fell
Fear God in this old man, have mercy on him, have mercy on the year.
Now it's your turn
I'll eat it later
The poor guy just wants to rest.
That old man is tired.
This is him who returned
And he is tired
I do not interfere in their affairs.
I don't bother myself; I command them.
I was planning to take the transaction to the bank while I was going to work.
And I threaten, and if someone is late, woe to him.
Oh, my dear, may you be safe.
Trust my work
Oh, on this nose and these small eyes, this Chinese girl, goodbye and take care.
Bou Saïd
This is where I keep sending you every day.
Good luck, O Saeed
Forbidden, oh, its smell
In my nose
Khanforosh Khanfar
Main corridor
No, Dad, I'm at the branch near the market.
And go there
I'm not going to the branch at the market anymore; they tell me I'm not there, I'm not sure.
God willing, goodbye.
I can hit the sun.
Tessatar Shams
I entered my neighbor's house
The maid recognized me
She asked me, "Are you okay?"
May God guide you.
No, no, I can't stand Shnufroush, Ya Saeed
Mom, where is my dad now?
From Al-Luweh
This is what I say to any bank.
They told him the papers are incomplete.
Tell him to take a taxi
Mom, we had a meeting with the manager.
The important thing now is how my father is, God willing, I will see him.
My head is a little dizzy and aching.
Here I am telling you in front of him
Let your father rest.
Poor guys, Ya Said
They must adhere to the attendance after this; reports are written about what they do and on that basis.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, Abu Shaheen
You could say I was stubborn and not stubborn.
What do you mean?
That first year
Misfortune is written upon us
Your children are men
We need to help them
And the poor ones say to me
Honestly, you have no story.
It means that now the young people who don't have fathers won't finish their transactions.
He returned to his job, a job that makes a difference.
In a job that allows you, I mean, permits you to go out.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
No, I only want the coffee behind you.
Where are you, Abu Saeed?
I'm going to finish the deal; my son is happy.
In this ministry here, I am drinking coffee.
Taking her, I relied on the ground after God to help us.
Goodbye
Mom, heal me. Okay, I will see you later, bye.
It's better for you.
I warned you
Because I heard you say the truth to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I'm not mad at you.
Come on, your father, if he doesn't complain to you
I don't see him silent
And he does not speak
Be patient with him, help him, fear God in this man.
You woke me up shouting at me, and I reached there. What's going on?
Dad, you used to be a government employee, and you know what inventory means.
Hahaha, they are writing this first.
Now, really, now, come on, they're doing it.
Dad, tomorrow is the last day to receive transactions at the Development Bank for loans.
No, no, I say.
That's enough, father.
I told you two words and I believed him.
Egoogol has an inventory committee
Intubation
Oh, how are you?
Come on, hurry up and finish his transaction.
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing
He returned from the field, and he was silent.
I talk to him, but he doesn't respond to me
Neither modest nor shy
So, your father can't be blamed; he didn't take a stance against you.
If this pleases you.
May Allah reward you all well; you have not fallen short.
He was supposed to call you.
Why does he bother calling the bed, what's wrong with it?
Dear and precious, oh father
You've never let us down.
Erase me
Leave him to me
That's it, Dad.
Honorable and esteemed
Khanfaroosh Khanfaroosh
Thank you, may God bless you
May you be pleased, Dad
May Allah reward you with goodness
We decided from today onwards
That we handle our transactions ourselves
You haven't fallen short, Dad. May Allah reward you with goodness. Thank God.
But I swear, I will give you, Dad.
Consider it the last one
But I just can't wait.
Call me now
I'm not going to the minister, dad; I'm not going to him.
The minister is upset with you
He gets upset; he needs to go after the kiss. Go, no, no, no, this can't happen. That's all, except for the minister.
Where should I go, Dad? I don't know what to tell you; I don't want to upset you.
No, don't tell me and I won't tell you
Your transaction with me is considered complete and ready.
Here on your way, and you're going to finish the deal. Happy, my brother.
And the one who surrenders you, my father
Consider it the last deal you'll make with me.
Whatever you command, Dad
But your son had to sign this paper.
It means I will take it and bring it tomorrow.
Honestly, I advise you to bring it today.
And if the transaction did not benefit them
You will wait for me after two months
No, no, stop. I'll make him sign it now.
No, no, I don't need it.
Call him, but let me come in for two minutes.
And I will make it sincere for you
It means you don't know Saeed.
No, I haven't taken leave
And I only go to Morocco
No, and all the guys are with him.
I ask one, where are you?
Tell me, I am with Saeed
I'm just waiting for my shift to end.
Alright, man
Come and get rid of your papers yourself
Jan Tarasht, your children
You don't have children.
I feel like I can't see clearly.
Please go ahead, uncle
You haven't fallen short.
There's no use.
I will leave you.
And go to the house of the disabled
I don't tell them where I'm going.
What do you tell them, Abu Saeed?
I write them something else
All praise be to Allah
He was released from prison yesterday.
No, by God, my sister.
We got rid of these talks
He killed him, Iani, and you should not speak on the radio or on television.
I didn't take him anywhere except for nonsense.
May God guide him and improve him, God willing.
Come on, my sister, goodbye. May God protect you.
That is the prison door
I was traveling yesterday
Oh my sister, what are you saying to me?
He called once on this program, the one they call Melis.
And yes, my sister, the man is talking.
Here he is, Khaled Jassim
And just say nonsense.
Come back, sister, listen to their group at work.
My sister is talking about the government.
Wyeeb Sira Petrol Aflous
My mother, my mother, what happened to this boy?
And not one in his quarter
Those who were happy about him and telling him to do this and do that
They all disowned him.
God is the one who guides him again
And I, my sister, excuse me, I am going to follow the chef.
May God bless you
Come on, Dad
Come, sit down
Stop the nonsense, my dear.
By God, Dad, I am tired and sick.
This is her falling in the hospital
You don't deserve it, I swear, Mom.
I don't want what happened to happen to you.
Dad, I didn't tell you.
What, Mom
And he sat and shouted
I haven't left you
Oh Dad, I passed this time.
I am telling you this
Oh my mother, may Allah protect you
Forget the topic
Just nonsense
So, why is the manager's face sad, poor thing?
Forbidden means after all these years you come today and tell me we finished you.
You don't understand the words, Saleh.
Stop with the nonsense
Just give us one.
Come on, Saleh
And you are a person who is not concerned with these matters.
Mashallah, you're very observant of the general situation and you criticize.
Not easy
It means we only erased one person.
And you are one of them
It's not you who is meant.
That's it, goodbye
Brother Saleh
But God willing, your uncle Bou Menira doesn't know.
My dear, oh father, I miss you, I long for you.
Where are you from?
If I ask
Tell him to work.
Would you like me to finish you or not?
I asked his mother, and she said he is working.
No need
Mother, you have to go in.
What do we do with her now?
Our daughter got involved with him.
What you command me to do
I give him a two-week deadline
But I swear I didn't work, I swear I didn't, and I took him to court and told him to release him.
Are you drinking coffee now?
You only get confused like a fly, only in your head.
Mom, honestly
I want to go out
Don't go out
I know you want to leave.
Your heart, oh, your heart is stuck on coffee
You want to chat and get confused
Come on, go bother yourself and sleep, come on
And tomorrow morning, go look for a job.
God willing, I will get up in the morning, I mean.
Mom, I told you, I swear I’ve quit this habit.
That's it, I swear.
Mom, honestly, I feel a little bit upset.
I don't even bring up nonsense.
You are very stubborn
We’re not just talking about the old days.
Where, man? You look like you're on silent mode. Give us one from the old days, man.
We heard, we heard, but it's all nonsense, we heard.
Stop with the nonsense
Just nonsense
Saleh Mowjood
Saleh Raqid
So my son did something wrong yesterday and I didn't know.
All we need is for Jafa Salih to be present at the coffee.
They have taken from you
Oh mother, fix the matter.
Because there were people present
You're just Nadia.
I won't waste your time with me.
That pair is at the door, very close, very close.
But the blame is not on you.
Shame on him who didn't keep you in check.
My son and bread in my hand, I know you well, not well.
You're like the one who smokes these cigarettes.
Whether you perform the pilgrimage or not, I say, or I don't say; I just talk nonsense or I don't talk nonsense.
I am telling you this
I am broadcasting on the radio
Wala Saleh Bisana is nonsense
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high sense of patriotism.
We can't bother you.
But what can we do now
Come on, forgive us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
John, you didn't tire yourself; you are dear to us.
No, by God
Hey brother, I wait for you every day just to tell you nonsense.
Hey brother, you are a brave person, I am not afraid.
And whoever gives you up once, tell her.
I am God, I give you peace, that's it.
Tell him to shut up, say it, and whoever greets you with nonsense, God
Come on, man, I really need you. Just one, just one for my sake.
Amazing, my brother
Anyway, Your Majesty
Regarding the position
The job, on the contrary, you deserve it. You are a patriotic and dear person to us.
We were calling you to inform you.
John, may your reputation be clear before all of God's creation
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there's no vacancy.
Poor guys, they want me to work them, but there are no jobs.
And now, how will you manage the house with your mother?
And don't forget afterwards
Four kids have them
God is generous
Don't despair, my love
Keep hope alive
And I do not stop
I have to go look for a job for you.
So that my father doesn't cause us problems
I swear to you, Manira, I am ready to do anything.
And repentance after I say it's just nonsense.
Just nonsense
You know what I do these days.
I told you.
But only God can guide you, Abu Fahd
Don't listen to the talk
I go myself and tell the minister the truth about the mess he's making.
What do you think, Minister?
He definitely understands it like that
You're right
Just this thing
What cannot be kept silent about
You know there's a rumor that they'll replace you and that you'll be removed quickly and a lot.
I'm looking for a way to get rid of it.
I don't want anyone to feel that I have a part in the matter.
Your idea is right
I keep thinking about it
The way I get Sultan out of your way
Are you hearing about Saleh Saleh but nonsense?
May God protect you, this is from our neighborhood.
We entrust it to him
Our dignity, oh brother Saleh, is in your voice
No, Salih
And I am one of your biggest followers.
Laa Saleh, Mashallah, he doesn't need anything anymore.
And God willing, I will try.
He comes back, you hear his voice, and you feel happy.
Bou Fahd is asking about you himself.
Except say, O Saleh
Why did you stop?
Honestly, I have some problems, psychological and health-related.
Just tell the truth
You are considered a fighter.
We haven't heard that from you in a long time
God, God, God, I ask you, O Saleh, come back
Just once for my sake
I want to hear it on the speaker
Saleh says, "It's done."
No, guys, it's really hard, I swear, honestly, it's really hard.
What's wrong with you?
The Riyal begs you
Abdulrahman, I am cut off.
Then you didn't tell me that you are looking for a job.
This is your chance.
Let the guy hear you and enjoy it; the next day, go to his office and ask for the job.
And a hollow space if it does not bother you
Because I care about your best interest.
So, how?
That's it, we don't want a revolution, go home.
Lalalalala, enough, we don't want it.
Alright then, man, ouch ouch ouch, be patient, man, let’s understand each other.
That's it, we don't want anything here anymore.
Alright, alright
Alright, so if I go back now, I mean, the last time, of course, I cut off, but the last time.
For example, Shehab means Bo Bo Bo Bofahd, he hears, he likes to hear.
Shalli Ianse means knowing the problems, there are many troubles, very many are present.
What is the thing he prefers to listen to, I mean, or does he like protests, I don't know, you tell me.
According to the signed contract
He determines his responsibilities
Eighty-eight centimeters, centimeters
The work is going to be a mess.
Until he interrupts me
Why did the employee do this?
Where is seventh, seventh
Until he interrupts me
Seventh, Your Excellency the Minister
Why the employee
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
He drives his brother's car.
Guys, enough with the nonsense.
And as long as you come back to us with your voice, we don't want you to cut us off anymore.
What people are blaming me for, I mean, the last time.
Honestly, I really cut it off.
Mom, didn't you say it's finally over?
And you are the one who prevented him
Oh, my girl
This is what they call nonsense; I expose it on the radio.
I just heard, but they told me
I doubt that there is someone in the ministry who is leaking information to him.
What a terrible weather now
The weather is terrible.
At your service, Minister.
I don't care
All my time belongs to the ministry, may God protect you.
I have heard it, Your Majesty.
Oh, I swear I said it just for you.
He didn't give me anything, brother.
He didn't talk to me.
Abdurahman, tell me, go and work for you.
He didn't talk to me
By God, you are poor, Salih.
Really breaks my heart
I am a secretary at Bofed
And he knows the whole story
The group exploited you; they wanted a specific target.
And unfortunately, they reached him.
And do you know who's behind this story?
Abdulrahman, son of Fureijkom
He is the one who planned all of this.
Boufeld impossible, what keeps you busy?
One day, I will do with him the same thing that happened with Sultan.
Madam Mashhoor about you
Impossible for anyone to distract you
Take me to court so I can get a divorce
I found the solution
We are now the best community in the world
Flawless
We don't have it
We have no flaws at all
We are comfortable
What is the mediating?
Even if someone knows you, they will tell you to wait your turn.
Because the system
He takes more rights than the stranger.
We do not rely on strangers.
We don't have it
Your effort, your work; we have no flaws, we only have flaws.
One of the elders
He will go and make you stay at home
We don't have anything like that.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahhairi
Known as Saleh Bisana Kharabait
I don't want dinner
I was running, then I turned to the shirt and it tore.
Shafeh Yadeed took off her hat, I respect you.
I saw a boy wearing the new shirt that you and I just bought from Villagio.
This is a small scoop, meaning a little bit for him.
And this, well, don't get upset.
And I put it on my conscience
You, O Adoul, when you saw a boy with such a mischievous look, I was amazed by him.
It's up to him.
Why is Walid's T-shirt tight?
A guy wearing just a new T-shirt, I got tired of your chest, I hesitated, and I told your dad to buy you one.
Are you ashamed of yourself
Why did I tear Walid's T-shirt?
Just to tell you
Don't let me carry you, I'll stick you in the flood.
I say, my brother Sultan
Why do you keep hitting him like that and messing with his face?
This is it, little ones, not like you.
This is it, people, this is it
Oh, people
والا يبي اهل وناس عدلين ايربونه وايادبونه
مب ايخلونه
ثمن كلامك يا سلطان وعن الخرابيط
ودني المدرسه ياهل انا ياهل
طول عمرك مغرور
ربوا اعيالكم عدل
واذا انتوا مب قد التربيه ومب كفو
انا لي الحين محترم نفسي
ومابي اغلط عليه واهزاه جدام مرته
اخوان اشكبركم
والله ان تدخل عدول وطق وليدو مره ثانيه والا سوا له شي
I only blame himself
The one wasting my time with you
Respect yourself already
Let's go to her; let's go see her.
What I respond to them
Oh, where are you, oh bygone era
and pure intentions
Come on, with forgiveness and well-being.
My brother, you don't have more than this either.
No, no, this is a big lie.
Put everything you have in your hand and come quickly.
The depth of the disaster that fell on our heads
Oh, just tell me exactly what happened, Dad.
Brother Ahmed, I forgive him; he's busy with work at home, and I have to go.
The pants are going to be fixed.
This is the act of a spiteful person whose heart is sick, filled with hatred and malice.
This is Sultan's action.
Wow, where can I find someone to cut all these clothes?
My new clothes, I haven't enjoyed them; I haven't worn them. God is sufficient for me against them.
I need to see him.
I'm telling you to sit down.
If you go at the right time, he will deny it and say, "Oh, people and their deeds."
So, what's the opinion?
You are my beloved Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
I know
My dear Walid
What do I say
Just tell me
Where did you put the scissors, Mom?
Under the bed
They destroyed him, may God ruin their lives.
But I see it in it
I'm not silent about it.
This one is a crazy person, not sober.
The most important thing now
And I do not change it
But this computer story is my project.
Braveh, I won't leave her.
Let our son be the one who broke their computer, and we didn't know.
My soul, call out to my soul, let's go see her together, whether he does or not.
Forget the nonsense, Fuhod.
Go, go, your circle, go, make others laugh.
I'm telling you, turn around
Go laugh at someone else, Fuhud
Awaysh Hayaj
The Time of Gentle Hearts
and pure intentions
Hello
So I'm the one who goes and looks for his friends.
Laugh at others, Sultan.
So he can falsely and baselessly accuse me
The scissors cut
Respect yourself.
Oh, Abdulrahman, I am right, oh my father
It's your brothers Fahad and Sultan's fault
Oh Dad, every day they fight like this.
I don't know
A session like this
We are supposed to sit her down.
To review our work
And the deeds of those who came before us
And what we will become
We take lessons
And we learn
This is a peace meeting, my dear.
In the size of a camel
Do you have children?
He doesn't understand anything
His role model is his father, I do not want for you.
His role model is his father
You, O Sultan
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother
For me
By paying for the computer
Alright, now when you extended your hand to him
It is a matter of your connection
No, that's not how I want to get rid of him.
Abdulrahman, this is the funniest thing I've heard after Hajj; he never stops talking.
So, where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him
You made it the next day
Look, don't be shy
If you are a real one, close the door. I tell you, close the door.
You didn't say that Abdulrahman Salihkum is on Ba'adh.
But I swear, I won't go into his room and break it, break it.
That is your brother.
Not normal
Your brother is not normal.
Now, I am waiting for the next one to come.
Fahad on his head, on his head
Be quiet, be quiet, just you guys, sitting here fooling around, they have no shame in their actions.
Your paradise is just for little kids, but oh father, just for you.
I swear to God, I will show you, I will show you, I swear to God, I will show you
Swat, swat, oh mom, swat it and I'll make it bigger.
Blood of my mother
My heart went astray with this scream
Oh God
Let's leave our situation as it is
By God, Dad, it's shameful
This while I am gathering you and your interests
He won't fall short with them.
A day in the night when they reconcile.
He didn't have time, Mom.
And upon him, upon him
Masha'Allah عليه
Hajiyeh Fasiḥ
But, oh mother
May God guide you
You are supposed to calm yourselves down.
I swear, Mom, fire is fuel.
And with God's blessing, I will become.
Oh, you, Abdulrahman
I want your help, I have become Pharaoh
Oh, Dad, the wise, may God guide you.
Two behind each other
Unfold, unfold
You have exposed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saad is coming out to look at you and laugh at us.
Oh, the officer's luck, he wants us, he wants us, and we're telling him
Don't worry about him, the officer will handle it.
The most important thing is that I delete all three of them.
Please
Man, don't come to me, you also don't come to me.
The officer's order, believe me, I understand them from above.
I heard that the officer forbade him.
From above, I mean I am far away
My brother was right when he said he was absent.
Please, you have now signed that your children will not do it again.
Thank you, thank you
Welcome, my brother. Welcome. Please, go ahead.
How does the officer prevent them from walking? Trust me, I'm sure.
Listen to me
I didn't want to tell you this in front of them.
This is Abdulrahman, their older brother.
Assistant Undersecretary of the Ministry
And the second is their middle brother, the director of the authority.
Go take two pills of Paracetamol and rest.
The officer's arrest is a pendulum.
You have two pendulums here.
Wow wow, God is sufficient against the enemy
God is sufficient for me against the enemy
God is sufficient for me against the enemy; they played a game with me.
Wow wow wow, what are these stories about?
Oh, come here, someone from there to here.
This is a hand of a Jannah's father. Yesterday, he made a flat dish and deleted it.
Are you really donating?
He is a good, respectful, and well-mannered young man.
And he says, this is the daughter of the poor.
Even if
Now he's catching up with you
He does not look at you directly.
And I hope for you
Oh, this is all until the opportunity comes.
So why is it that when you passed by, I turned around to look at you?
It means coincidence
You turn your head while she turns hers at the same time.
No, but there is definitely something.
So I notice when I pass by you
I feel that she is happy inside, she has joy and happiness.
Hey man, go tell her to give me a pen.
Take my notebook
I swear, I don't even know her name anymore.
Excessive romance beyond necessity
No, Dad, you're now in the twenty-first century.
By God, you look like you're really into it.
You want the truth
Since we sat down in this gathering
Don't worry
And from today, I intend to dedicate myself to you.
But now you need to rest a little.
My father only needs to do an outdoor shoot outside the city after yesterday.
We haven't been destroyed, I swear, my brother. I told the secretary, tell him I want no press interviews, no television appearances, not even contracts.
Let me be free to spend some time with the family.
May God be with you.
Even when you're busy
First thing I have in mind
And I have the owner’s number in a word today
What did you delay for?
They bought the land and settled there for many days.
Cave in series and acting
Um Abdulaziz says that they are poor people and live within their means.
Their share, we have no share in it.
Good morning, Uncle.
Hello, I hope everything is fine.
Oh dad, this car is knocking on us every other day.
It seems your battery is dead.
No problem, don't worry. I have the juice, and I will prepare it for you now, God willing.
May Allah reward you with goodness
We're here, we're here, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid's statement is correct
That's it, I will leave tomorrow, so I won't see you, and I will stay there so I can come to you every day.
Be honest with us, what do you want?
That's it, Dad.
Please.
But what about Walid?
Rashid Abdullah
Same name
He returned to kill Abu Jastans.
You are right, my mother
I was very happy when I found out that Rashed Abdullah, the actor I love, turned out to be Yaruna.
Everyone praises him.
They say he is modest and kind.
The Yaar before the house, yes indeed.
I am the only one who takes pictures with him.
Because the guys at work believe me
I can't believe that our house is attached to the house of the actor Rashid Abdullah
Speak to him, speak to him so he believes.
Deep in the world
What I see on TV
And I hope to see him.
Come on, our dear, thank God, oh Lord, thank God
Look, if they want a Jallob Bwashra, I have one.
I'm ready, but guys, take it easy on me because I haven't gotten used to it yet and I haven't mastered it properly.
You have received the news.
Yes, by God, he didn't fall short. May God reward him with a thousand good things.
Peace be upon you
They confirmed that there are employees transferring them to the new ministry branch in Adkhan.
What they told you is no longer valid
I didn't hear the names
No, but what I heard is certain.
An Bo Ali is with them.
My name is I.
But we don't know exactly who we will be transferring yet.
I, I, where are you, and where are you, and where are you, and where are you, smoking, what God cannot give you, may He not grant you.
Dad, whether you can or not, this is work.
Actually, the committee is still studying the matter.
But if she chooses you
Blessings upon us, O Abu Walid, Sam.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali
Sorry, brother Rashid, it's about the furniture.
We are neighbors today
His family is enough
This is from your good nature, Abu Walid.
May Allah reward you well, brother Rashid.
I heard a lot about your kindness.
God, continue the love
But, my daughter
And I am ready to negotiate until you find the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When will I honestly see that the furniture is very old?
I have to change it
God willing
Come on, sister, I already did that before.
If you need anything
Consider me like your sister
Hopefully my eyes won't cry for you
Where did you go, my love?
Yesterday she called me and I forgot to argue with her.
No, my love, it's not about tiring you.
No more
Yalla, goodbye. I'll call later.
Honestly, I was talking to her.
But these people are not from our cloth.
We are poor, where are we compared to them?
Mom, it's okay, you.
Light up for you, Mom
Just wait for me a little bit.
And I will give you the signal when you should propose to her.
I killed you
No, mom, I don't care.
And she comes to me and asks me to propose to her
I already put dinner in the living room.
If I want to have dinner
Now I will let the driver take her to the university, God willing.
And then we agreed that we are family
My car is gone.
And soon, God willing
I called to thank her
They support and love goodness, yes indeed.
Yes, by God, you're right, Dad.
Even if our people don't do it like that
And my name is certain with them
Are you sure?
Oh my God, what are these disasters that have been deleted on us?
Why am I now so dizzy from this news? I don't know how to handle it.
Soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, you now, God willing, God willing, good, thank you, may God reward you with goodness, may God reward you with goodness
Good things happen, oh Abu Ali
The committee met today.
And I compiled the list of names they transfer as smoke
My name is and with them
Zain, talk to the manager and ask him to remove your name.
I don't think there's any benefit, Ya Ali. I don't think there's any benefit.
His need, and he told me there is no hope
The great artist
Consider your name as not being on the list.
Thank you, you haven't fallen short, and may God bless you, Abu Salem.
Come back, please.
I want to take a picture with you to show the kids.
Oh, my children are having fun now.
May God keep them for you, God willing.
Can I have a picture of the artist?
At your service, may God keep you safe.
Please, please
Oh, you, oh, you, yes sir
You and whoever you cherish.
Tell me a day or two in advance, please.
Come on, come on, Mom, get ready
Get ready, get ready, what right?
What's wrong with you, Yenit?
And she said I have no objection
Leave my mother alone
Come on, my soul, for them
That's enough, my son.
You don't feel that we are poor people and just getting by.
You need to dress up.
Where do I get the money to dress up and look fancy?
Looks like you've got me into trouble with the people
Ashandaj, I am impressed with the jewelry. This is the first time I see you like this.
It's not my right.
The right of Umm Ali
Umm Ali is proposing marriage for her son Ali
You want nice clothes and a little jewelry.
According to her, she wants to show them that they are good people and have goodness, I mean.
Oh oh, Mashallah
I am capable of it
Mashallah on her, this is my wife; she has grown taller and blushed.
Mashallah, I won't say anything.
Queen, Mashallah, you are a queen.
You also need to get ready
Because they say, let my father come and meet her father.
Sure, I won't go in these clothes
First thing I did was to get my new handkerchief all dirty.
Oh, Mom, slowly, slowly, on the woman's feelings.
Umm Waleed means she didn't hold back; she gave you her best, so take it easy on her.
Ei Ei
Zain, now we also need to become like them.
Why didn't his mother go to propose to her?
Just that woman
Now I have to go see the reels later.
By God, I bless you just as you are.
Only God keeps you safe, the Beshter.
People of goodness did not fall short
They didn't fall short; we stayed in the Beshte.
Qut 'Aad, I am coming to take it from you so you can complete the waiting period, okay?
Everyone is for you
Hey bro Rashed, how can I calm down like this or wear the bisht?
It's okay, just look, come first.
This needs to be closed.
Oh, you bother me
A little bit of a return on you, the garment, but look.
This is God, peace be upon you
Left hand inside the bisht
Threatened, this is how it is.
This type of Beshte is like this from underneath.
God, God
Wow
Walking, walking, a little weight, I want a little weight.
Oh S. A.
Like this, you're a millionaire
God willing, they will give you seconds.
The left has become this low, the right this color.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
Oh, living, what do I see in her?
Are you helping me?
Tell me, because you're my friend so much, and we don't want to part ways.
I say the truth, my brother will go and propose to you.
Tell the truth, don't say anything about her sister, and she embarrasses herself.
The empty speeches, you've been bothering me about this lately. A few days ago, you told me Soad wants you for her uncle, and today it's for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
And I am sitting and looking
The most important thing is that they don't know the relationship between us.
No, they don't know we're just colleagues.
That's enough then
They need to know tomorrow.
Why did Walid refuse?
I am shouting
You refuse my son Walid
The actor is more honorable than you, hypocrites.
But you all
Are you pretending all your life?
It's not your turn.
Serve the people
You attract people
You wear acting clothes in life in front of God and His creation.
The bisht I appeared in on television
Me and you all
I wore accessories, gold, and jewelry
And my role model
You got married
What is the scene?
A man walking in front of his wife
He took off his turban like this, facing forward.
And he does not turn to the right or to the left
Man, you remind me of that guy from your group that you asked me about, the one with you in the office.
Come with him, a boy and a girl
Why does he walk like that?
As they say
God help him, oh Riyal
Walk, sir, do not stop
Poor guy, he has no personality at all.
He laughs, then he's happy.
So, she dressed us up, Auntie.
Lalalala, this way isn't nice, and you're just sitting there.
He’s like this with walking, and you’re standing up. Get up, stand up, stand up.
I asked you, O Khamis, I asked you
What is he doing, going to the lady?
Come, I want you to cook a little.
Where are you going to sit with us for a while?
He messed up his wife.
You like me this much.
Ah, Khamis
Turn off the TV, and if a female announcer appears.
I am afraid you will cause me problems.
And by God Almighty, at work.
I'm sitting, I swear, sitting with Salim, my friend, at work.
Hajja
The line is closed, I want, I want
The phone just rang; soon you'll cause me problems at home.
Now you're saying I didn't leave your friend, I only sit with you guys once in a while.
Come on now, maybe you'll arrive soon. God help me with the package.
And then she kicks you out
You're not the first one to shoot.
No, no, I can't, brother.
My sweetest mother in her grave
My mother, did she advise me?
She told me not to shoot
No, no, I can't. Impossible.
I'm looking for something for you
Nonsense, nonsense, stay, stay
You are completely unnatural.
I won't come to you.
Tell me, I mean, I want to understand what is going on.
No, no, Mom, I mean, I can't allow you to say that.
Salem himself is considered one of the best of our youth in the area.
He is telling you to divorce.
He said he's divorced now, that's it, that's it, I mean, he's free, he's divorced, what's the fuss about?
No Thursday, you look like a formal Yanit.
Leave me, leave me, and the one who will deliver you.
Come on, I’m just chatting with him, I’ll go now, our little ones.
May God guide you
The poor hurt the heart
I want to give him the message coming from the Minister's office, an important task.
God gives you guidance, so you give from Him
No, no, nothing, nothing
Here I am, I will take her to him.
Because I have a meeting tomorrow with the women's delegation that is coming to us
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you? You're not sleeping today.
Al-Wal Salim
I am your brother Khamis
No, I swear I'm talking to you awake, I swear.
My brother, b
They will erase my name so I won't attend, brother.
What do you mean by deleting your name?
The only one who can erase your name is His Excellency the Minister, and that's it.
Hey brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Official and formal meeting
I need you
Salem Salem Salem
Tell the truth
Who was I talking to while you were sneaking behind the tank?
Safe, safe, safe, I swear, safe.
As long as you argue with Salim
Are you saying or what?
Ali, I am
My uncle Ali, I am here, O Khamas
So you're not telling the truth, huh?
No, I'm still casual with me.
You suspected, brother, that I was talking to a girl.
Life is difficult again
And the one who greets you, Salim, called.
And the one who hands you over so I can believe you
He's the one who told you to call.
What’s your business?
I don't interfere in what doesn't concern you, or else you'll see that I know my job with you too.
I complain about you
Oh, it's you
How do you live with someone like this, her tongue is so long?
Let's start the meeting now.
Long live your age, Hassan will go to the Thursday gathering.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Please go ahead
Say "Inshallah, he will find him again."
I tell you, as soon as he saw women, he was afraid.
I visited the ministry for you, but you didn't come here.
Come on, come on, everyone is waiting for you in the meeting hall.
I can't sit with women.
Hey Thursday, how do you know, wife?
I'm afraid you'll call.
You want it, you doubt me, come on man, you don't understand.
Icon Iran and Mashila, then he takes me back home
Your wife will only call at this time.
Of course, you as a big company
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of the ministry
Guys, what's wrong with the table? It's shaking.
No, Your Excellency, it's not this table, it's me.
Please reply to me.
Who am I with
Sorry, what do you want?
Call me for the rest
Moment by moment I tell you
Actually, he fainted because he's afraid he'll go to their house.
Wow, her brother
He said, "Are you telling me, sister, if you die, in your work, this one with the women, don't come home."
That's why I submitted a letter to the ministry to transfer from our department.
Exactly, and he himself told me that the minister agreed to transfer him, meaning do whatever you want, what else do you need?
Hey brother, what is this woman?
This is a joke.
Hey, what should I tell him, Khamees? Who am I talking to?
I'm telling you, I'm not awake.
And now what are you going to do? Your wife and children are coming tomorrow.
Honestly, I don't know what to do.
And you carried out her request. Why didn't I let you go back to your home and see your children?
Because she wants to confirm officially
Alright, give her the papers.
Alright, this is what I did: I sent her brother and gave him the paper.
Because she saw the minister's signature and confirmed it.
Hopefully, it will be okay if you agree. God willing, maybe tonight we can go back home, God willing.
My sister, and this is the minister's signature
After the fight
Tomorrow he/she will work in the new department
It means from tomorrow, a different office and work than what was there before.
May God bless you in this direction.
Oh God, may you be safe, and this is the minister's visa.
Nothing, nothing, that's on your right hand.
Oh, yes, yes, God's blessings.
Here you go, this is my ready-made submission.
And Saad, and Abdulqadir, and Mashallah, meaning a very big office, yes indeed.
Goodbye
How to request a transfer
Man, the entire department is women.
Madam Ya
And no one can make a decision a second time except the minister himself.
You are forced to continue until the minister returns.
Hey, you agree with your colleagues.
And you call them by the names of men so your wife won't recognize.
And I left for you after two additional rights for the new employee
The new employee, your intention is the new employee.
Since the day the minister's office was moved, I haven't been working with us.
I'm serious
And he looks funny and he laughs at it, imagine a real mercenary among five women, he looks antique.
But they tell his wife to be jealous of him, who else?
Blindness
Poor guy, he's just getting by.
But he asked us that if his wife called, we should not speak to her, and we respected that and remained silent.
Hey Abdulqadir, the one with you in the office
This doesn't cost me anything; I have as much of it as you do, or not.
My son called saying my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Roh Sida, right first door
This is the care office
With the women, with the women
These are three female employees
And he is present; I think he is working.
Not about these movements
This is my wife; she gets jealous of me.
Because I am sweet
Now, may God guide you, Sultan.
We just want to know where we have reached.
My uncle, what happened is that my brother Saqr and I were at the bank yesterday.
Look, from this perspective, the project
Peace be upon you
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Come on, go to the kitchen quickly, let's go.
Now I'm wearing it, I'm about to go out.
Actually, your place should be the kitchen.
We don't have women; I don't obey men, oh God.
And the scorpion, if it gets angry, may God protect from its sting.
This is the rain's right, it's necessary. Look, look.
Look, uncle
Aisha, and whoever greets you, call the secretary and tell her to inform the employees.
Tell them that Ameerah postponed today's meeting to tomorrow.
Good, God willing
They issue these commands.
Woe to us if we don't implement it
They are supposed to know that she is a senior official.
And the relationship and responsibilities
The only thing they care about is that the woman is working.
In my life, I have never seen people look down on women like they do.
We are still living in those old days.
Come on, don't go to work yet. Go to the kitchen and make us some food.
Where are the servers?
And the second one is wandering; she's been gone for a week.
Even the maids did not escape their insults.
They are right to kick them out
God help you
The notes from the bank earlier are simple.
The upcoming
My uncle, what do they mean by "ashiqs"?
Actually, the villa complex wouldn't be beautiful without a garden.
Alright, the garden now.
Sister, before you go out, I want to take your opinion on the matter.
My love Fattoum, I have to go late to work.
Alright, come on, tell me, what's new with you?
Are you saying or should I go?
And play it at school
He returned to the Women's Union Committee.
And the school chose me to play with them in the national team.
Who are you, Minouna?
Now you're telling me you're going to the national team.
You know, if you think about it, you tell your brothers and your uncle, "What are they doing to you?"
You only blame yourself.
This is us warning you
Don't say anything to her, just greet her. I haven't seen you in a long time, my father.
I haven't seen you for a year, year.
Marry him off or not?
By God, may He guide you
Whoever takes one, neither uneducated nor with a certificate nor knows anything, may God guide you.
No, no, the problem with Real Madrid is that he's not educated.
And then this is Khamis, son of Al-Aqarib.
His bite caught him
No, and we only take one, not his level.
A clock hand like it
God help you
What should I do, Aisha?
Whenever the minister travels, all transactions are handled by me.
And Mustafa, the Director of the Security Resources Department, Tameera Tabbik, tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
You have the program
And now I dedicate myself to you, O Aisha
Hello Mary
Alright, come on now, come on, come on, let's go.
What do you say, Aisha?
Where do these things come from if not from these brothers?
I wonder what will happen
My dear Ma'ali, you need compresses so that Waihaj doesn't swell.
We warned her and told her not to tell them.
Rahat told them, "Come, they are going to beat her and humiliate her."
You know, if I told them, they would hate it.
Jan Haltak, you've been bothering him for a long time.
You play football.
Next time, I will break his neck
Find out who is speaking to you
The Oud Scorpion
Halkar Ji
Oh, come on, uncle, I didn't hit Sultan; I only hit him.
Oh, the words
I chose Economics and Political Science
Honestly, I chose graphic design because these days this specialization is in demand.
Architectural Geometry
It's not your turn
You took your chance
Greed is not good, and I am your father
Tamer, Scorpio
Hit it, break it, break her bones, crush her eyes
They guided me to it.
It's just sitting here with me, come on.
You go to the missions
And you will specialize in architectural engineering
Take it easy.
To make sure
Sultan and Saqr, I spoke to them.
They don't mind marrying you, Ameerah.
What else do you want?
No, Khamis, our son deserves it
I arranged the appointment with them and I will inform you, God willing.
Nominated as part of the delegation
I can't understand your circumstances.
But give yourself a chance for tomorrow.
I'm telling you the truth.
You're very interested in you.
And your nomination from above
His words are correct
My brothers, and I know them
Impossible for them to agree
I'm surprised by them
Their installments are deducted from my salary
And I am the one who supports the house.
No, don't tell me later to travel with me.
We are the ones planning to marry her this week.
What do you all say?
Thursday of the fool who doesn't even have a middle school certificate
Marry him and travel with him
Oh, the knowledge, oh God
By God, it's a shame for what they are doing.
If I refuse, they will slaughter her.
Oh Dad, how many times have I told you?
After you leave
I will go tomorrow, God willing.
Don't worry about it, I'm actually a Scorpio, born under the sign of Scorpios.
Even if I come, it's still okay.
I don't want to marry Khamis
And my soul, the kitchen
And put them in the living room
Tonight's match between Real Madrid and Barcelona
God willing, Valencia won't defeat us.
I am speaking to you from reliable sources
Sincere and diligent, oh, her work
What do you think about what just happened?
We made a mistake.
No way, we're not doing it.
Please go to your offices
Thank you, may you live long.
The provided t
Pour there
The minister's efforts
May Allah protect her and prolong her life as long as she is alive.
Please, Your Majesty, please.
Good evening, Minister Siah
Yes, long life to you
I washed the shirts
The soul of pouring coffee is truly Captain Emad
And next time as well
We are traveling the day after tomorrow to China to play a match there.
Hey Captain Nasseb, let me introduce you to my sister Maryam
What, where are you going, uncle? I'm going to Bibi, Imlaj.
You are a fool, you.
You can't tell your elbow from your navel; you want to take a princess.
God willing, peace be upon you
Yes, my aunt
A soul like the one inside it, and another one is jealous.
Actor Connections
I swear, I just talked to my mother a little while ago, Mashael also contacted me afterward.
It will be aligned afterward
Shame on you, Noof's search is not suitable at all for Mishaal.
Nouf, a sixteen-year-old girl
And Mashaal Terauli means twenties
So, why don't you take Mary's role?
It suits her more
Nouf's thirty rounds
Get rid of your oil from this suspicion they've placed on us in the committee.
This is a problem I am sure he won't stay silent about.
And he stands for us at the unit
He talks to you about art, family values, purposeful art, and the content—what is it?
This is from the one who put it for us in the committee.
The minister is the one who caused the committee's problem.
You, me, and Hamid can influence him, but that's it.
No no no, impossible
Because there is nothing that proves she is mine or Hamed's in the first place.
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks.
After he finds our names
May God protect you, the company is registered under Hamed's wife's name.
From this side, I don't get involved.
Then rest assured, I am not the chairman of the committee.
It means the final decisive word will be mine.
No, Dad, everything is fine. Welcome, welcome.
I just spoke to them and agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, Mr. Rashid. Please go ahead.
And as you know, you know that this meeting is dedicated to deciding on the approval of the conscience rape series.
Waoh from the production of Lamasat Asriya Arts Institute
Sweet, strange, daring action series
I am with Hamed
Honestly, the series has a very nice story.
I'm with you, Hamed
And what I liked most was when the mother took the gun and killed the neighbor.
Then I wanted to shoot the gun, but I cut myself in the car.
Don't you know that this is a car, and its owner had an action when the police searched it?
Come, her son from school
And the cartoon shot Briole
Jan gives her that strong blow, and the carton flies into the mother's room through the window.
Congratulations on the surprise
Wow, this shot, this shot, and the cartoon of the mother’s room.
It's a beautiful thing that a local company is delivering this level of work.
We need to encourage them and take their opinions.
No, brother Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion.
You made him into a brother Rashid.
With all due respect to your opinions and impressions about this series called "Rape of Conscience."
Rape of human values
And surprises, you understand
One and a half people in each episode
The text is for the next episode.
Written series without social awareness
He does not carry a meaningful message that elevates society
Tears are falling, which means I have to shout at the scenes.
Rashed, please.
You said your opinion, Ali said his opinion, I said my opinion, let Mr. Rashid say his opinion afterward.
Clear from the meeting
It means I'm just smelling a scent of an agreement between you.
Orderly arrangements of matters
Some people understand this, and it's their specialty, while others have nothing to do with the subject.
I refuse this series
I'm afraid he'll get us involved and cause us problems.
You don't have to worry about him.
What can I do, he can't do anything.
I walk my word
Jan gives me the juice and tells me this is from Mama Samira
I'm not sure what's going on anymore.
I can't believe it, Nasser
This is the new series that we are going to try.
The one I know of who rapes their daughter
Because of all the good between us, behind it
First of all, of course, this beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
Bassem, Hamed's wife, who sent the ring.
And my husband, of course, was responsible for fixing things and handling matters.
It accounts for five percent of the work.
Sweet round
Tony, I haven't seen such examples before; I haven't seen the series about Amani's lost rape. It was very good.
By the way
What is rape, rape, what is it, my Lord?
Oh, the rape of dreams
Why are all these names similar?
Last year, for example, most of the series were all about girls.
It means the series has over eight girls and ten more.
Dourj Mazmoun
We have a lot of lamps with us.
Oh oh, your luck has run out again.
Hala Omar
Oh, no problem, no problem
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. Nothing special.
Wait a minute and go.
I say it is necessary and important for me to say something urgent and significant.
I have to go now
What I know is that Rashid went and met the minister.
I tell you, I sat with him for half an hour.
And he said, these people will get you into trouble.
I'm telling you, he complained about us. Are you okay?
What happened now is that the minister's office contacted me, saying they are requesting me.
And you fear after the minister's trust.
The minister, I am meeting him.
Al-Riyal Yanai reaches his point of view in the series
No more
This is correct, Your Honor.
But first, I, Sa'a Al-Wazir, would like to clarify a point, and it's not my nature to speak about a fellow artist who is with me and is not present.
God bless you, Rashid. Everyone knows this feature of him.
He harbors resentment towards everyone around him.
All material interest
But he is a specialist.
As long as God keeps you safe, not everyone comes and gives their opinion on technical matters.
Especially television works
The series of conscience rape, God bless you, is what we are working on.
Bold daring work
At the Gulf level, God bless you, we will have a media scoop.
and enormous spread
Of course, this is your specialty, and you know more about it than I do.
Hollow condition, a continuous episode of Ipezh Al-Wayh
And our name is raised above
But what the journalist Abdelhamid wrote, listen listen listen
In fact, one of the actors commented saying
The series contains immoral calls.
He laments the decline in moral and artistic taste in work.
By God, bold words and strong criticism
Your group gets humiliated if journalist Abdulhamid follows them.
And when their words reach the officials
These people are smart; they know how to manage it.
Below is a gang
They want us to create a dedicated website for us
We put all the company's activities into it
You asked me, what is the company's name?
From today onwards, you are the media advisor.
And the series of conscience rape, which is supervised by Atarod Artistic Production Company, is considered.
A qualitative leap in Arab drama
for the noble ideas and values it carries
It is a series aimed at developing the community.
The journalist Abdelhamid himself is the one criticizing them for days.
Is it reasonable to turn like this, eighty-eight degrees?
How is this Abdul Hamid accepting himself like this?
Journalist Abdelhamid Washkala
Don't worry, Professor Hamed.
He asked me what I think of the series. I told him the series is hitting a high level across the Arab world.
God hears you.
Guys, my artistic feeling tells me that our series is going to be a hit.
We don't know where his lands are.
And he puts his bag and leaves.
The beginning is very encouraging
You guys, all these things you bring up in the series, we haven't seen them in our lives nor heard of them.
The written IBAN is in its title
Honestly, all your authors are amazing.
Oh, come on, either it happens or it doesn't.
Your series is really boring.
What do you think?
It looks like he's crying a lot, Dad.
We only care about silly series; that's our standard.
No one can understand him and catch him on the first try.
In hidden threads and dimensions, it requires focus for one to be able to understand what this work is trying to say.
By the way, this work is political.
It's forbidden to expose it to people
I heal you
Whoever you are, this is what they say: we are all eating poison.
Last night in Morocco, Ali and I were at Souq Waqif.
And sitting in a coffee shop
He didn't give me anything.
Nin Nasser, what do you think about the issue? If the Minister's happiness is upset, this is a big problem.
Within one week, it keeps us all in our homes.
God and the series, what is this? All the people who met him say he's a failure.
I hear that Rashid is planning to go to him.
And of course he tells him I didn't tell you that this series is a failure and a flop and there's no action.
You are a disaster, guys
Leave the matter to me
And in the depths, Nasser Ashbesui
Listen to me, Eli
From today onwards, I don't want any topic on your page criticizing the series.
Eli Raja
A few days ago, I came across the topic; there is no criticism of the work, only praise.
Please don't make me upset with you.
He/she/it ruled over it.
But I was just a chance.
If I were, I would never say such words.
Honestly, I haven't received any message thanking me for the series.
Wow, what an unparalleled success
Goodbye
Brother Rashid, forgive me
Do I trust you or do I trust the newspapers?
The rape of conscience is the jewel of television works
Long live your age, this is a journalist we agree with.
Listen to the second newspaper, I am writing.
Then they agree with the people, read, read on the page of the readers.
My heart stopped
A little, they don't tell me.
Oh father, the minister is pleased with you all.
Honestly, Nasser
Prepare for the Rape of Conscience Part Two
Lalalalala, just, brother, I don't want this to pass.
The first and last series I write
I'm more focused on my work, sir. Scrap is better for me than this job.
Part two after this ordeal
And third and fourth
Why aren't you guys getting the benefit?
One of the guys is sitting in Melesah.
Here we are in it
The magician said
Forward.
We want a word on the occasion of this success.
Praise be to Allah for the success
To skeptics, enemies of success
I am surprised.
How is the Evouz series winning the award while the boring and failed series does not?
But these people are specialists
They gave him the prizes, surely it's something we haven't discovered.
Prepare a second part for the series.
God willing, long life.
They said he's not a magician, only a magician.
With Your Reminder: The Rape of Conscience, Part Two
I see you were standing with the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals, we pretended, I mean.
Listen, he tells them to get ready, there's still a second part.
The same thing
The dirty money is entered into banks to be washed and come out clean.
These series that I watch are pathetic, weak, miserable, and trivial.
They bring her to Gulf and Arab festivals
To make her clean when they wash her, they give her awards and she becomes a sophisticated series among people. They clean her.
Is it reasonable? Why isn't it reasonable?
As long as the judging committees themselves are the entities producing the series
Peace be upon you
And peace and mercy be upon you. Thank God you have arrived.
Yes, they are, and we have signed a contract with them, but they want to reduce the price.
Come to the office
We are not a small bakery or a bakery that sells bread and rolls.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
Neither drops nor a dollar
They want it, or we cancel the contract
Enough of the contract we signed yesterday
With the European company
KKBWAB
What you see
A big worker, a worker who didn't get anything
For the first time, a live product will be launched, making it the first product in the world.
This is what I brought, not the biggest roti baker in the world.
I'm telling you
How did Roti Bih Susta
I'll kill you if you don't leave, or go to the kitchen. I'll look for a prisoner to cut him, and sometimes your hand might get cut.
Except for this bread roll with the sausage
The icon has cheese on it, and I want to close it.
This is my skirt, this is my pants
No, and you are the flatbread, the roti, the bag. So what, how so?
Abu Nasser, and how is this Susa supposed to be thrown?
So, when someone leaves work, they tell their friend, "I'm having a double breakfast."
Mountain of Light Hospitals dough, why didn't it go to them yesterday?
I know, I ask you why she didn't go yesterday.
The story, Your Highness, is that the bakers and the bakers who are overseeing the bakery.
He responded to the bakers.
This is what happened to you.
Shamsawi, you're just yelling at him like that.
I'm sitting here with these nonsense talks, neither football nor football, and it's messing up my work.
Do you know if your son likes football?
I heal her, meaning if a few employees take from the company to have fun with them.
You have four hundred employees in the company, here they are, and they are paid accordingly.
These eleven are considered the main players
And above them, he also took four reserve personnel and two administrative staff, but only took what was necessary, and he has only seventeen left.
The media spokesperson for the team
I always handle this matter with this message.
But I get by until I develop, even though the fans, I mean the audience, consider the most important player on the field and the twelfth player.
Let him enjoy himself; they come to him, and he is happy.
And we are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now he's the one who said he wants to play football first, I missed him.
He listened to your noise and obeyed you
Nothing else
Now, because he called some employees, he let them play in front of him, watches them, has fun with them, and enjoys himself. Then he gets annoyed with him.
He didn't kill him; he doesn't take employees.
Even if some of your friends need employees, lend them one, no problem.
The important bakers
Oh Mother, may God guide you. Who deserves to take the important bakers after it happens?
Tell me the second time I take employees.
No, no, let Hamdi review this transaction with me.
Hamdi at the hospital
Why is no one here for you, Your Highness?
I finished work and as I was leaving to get into my car.
Listen, Nasser Allah, may his life be extended, is calling me.
I walked on him
The goalkeeper who plays with us told me we can't find him, and tonight we have an important match.
Say: "What do you think? Our goalkeeper searched for us. We arrived at the stadium."
He said, "What do I wear? A goalkeeper's guard."
I've never played soccer or held a ball.
This is a situation.
What is left unspoken
And tomorrow, we will find you a job to work in, no wasting time, no football, no nonsense.
Let me tell you
Dad, you want me to solve the team and cancel it properly.
Yes, that's correct
Nice, Dad, God willing, just with this nose, but I am asking you.
H Haram means I will leave the team and ruin the final match
No, no, in this one, he has the child's right.
What are you doing?
Zain, congratulations on the victory
Teacher Nasser, congratulations on winning the cup
We wanted to know how you planned to win
Look, I prepared the team mentally, physically, and mentally, and thank God, the coach didn't fall short.
Inside my safe
Congratulations to all of you, and the party is just as I promised.
I say your dad looks happy.
I'm afraid he's embarrassed and trying to be polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, let's start like this, and peace be upon the Prophet. We want to congratulate you on your huge victory, Faryak, the International Bakeries.
The Great Victory
God bless you, God bless you, no, no, no
A picture without a Beshteh, moment by moment, hold a little.
No, no
There is a misunderstanding, the Pashtun dress
Undoubtedly, your care, great attention, and creative ideas played a major role in this victory.
and the coach's plan
But in the final, he played with a five-five, three, two formation.
And as a great athlete, you know that changing the plan confuses the players, yet the bakery team was not shaken and delivered a wonderful match.
and the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the top athlete at International Bakeries, what do you advise the players?
Until the end of time
Hello, hello
Your Majesty
Greetings to them, along with Hamoud Sultan
Welcome, may God bless them. They honor us; come, have dinner with us first.
Dinner is ready
God bless you, Abu Abdulaziz
and considered a contribution to the private sector
The team just now
You're jealous of us again.
No one means
Bou Abdulaziz
Agent of the machines we use in the factory
Did you see how
This is the one you wished to get to know.
The ball introduced me to him and I caught his eye.
Kill him, O Abu Abd al-Aziz.
And you've always been far from football.
And you are more stubborn than me
For your knowledge, the ball is in its enclosure; I see it between me and her, about fifty centimeters, meaning I am close to it.
Abu Nasser hasn't arrived yet
No, by God, he didn't come today either.
At a sports injury seminar, and he is the platinum sponsor, so he must be present.
I haven't seen anything yet
I saw the building behind the bakeries that he was about to turn into worker housing.
Hello, he's obsessed with football.
As we have accustomed you, dear viewers, before every match we meet with one of the icons of sports and converse with him.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas
What's the news with the International Bakeries team? We heard you're undertaking a comprehensive development process.
Forever, on these offices and this fatigue.
A trivial amount, I mean, right now, all my effort is only worth one million dollars.
No, dear, come on, get a little more excited, get a little more excited.
Heidi, it was your mistake, not mine, brother Shaheen.
My mistake
Shafi, I made a mistake.
But you didn't tell me that the players are needed in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf reach unbelievable levels
It means the player who is worth two hundred thousand.
Here in the Gulf, they take it for three or four million dollars
Understand me, Mr. Masoud, how?
Stable fax from me here
I will show him to you while he is present
I keep telling you, my father bought four players for the team, in addition to the new shipment that includes four players.
This is again what is this, huh? Amazing, this is where they put Billy and Renaldino, all hidden away.
It is written on it: ten thousand.
Yes, yes, my father, but this price, God bless you, was set by a Turkish club.
In the Emirates, they want him for one million two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Alright, can we check the shipment?
Definitely in front of you
The man is a duck
All right then
No, no, I will give you everything guaranteed
Samin Mashallah, you're very beautiful, Samin.
This is a foundation; this is a right to establish a foundation.
The oppressive dominance
This is the most important thing for a player: if it gets damaged, there's no use afterward.
You haven't fallen short.
Let me tell you, I will deliver them to us, the club, the club. What did I say, the club.
What is he doing?
Let's go, my praise, let's walk
With blessing, with blessing
This is God, peace be upon you, buds
Yes, I bring them from the jungles of Africa. What should I do for them?
I raise them, nurture them, train them, then send them to the stadiums.
I didn't ask for anything. Don't get mad at me, take it, take it. You have space in the car, or I'll carry you in the pickup truck.
It was only when he saw them pressuring us.
The attacker is attacking me
Kakakanau Makalali Dandah Lae
Download the defender
Cashew Makakakani Lolololo, this is the one that should go down
Our coach is inexperienced.
God willing, on Mars
No Spain, God willing, on Mars
I didn't like the way he read the match report.
This walks on a line
The match has its principles
Hopefully in two days
I heal you, your voice reaches up high
This boy was born in Spain.
He can't accept that the coach is an idiot who doesn't understand football.
Listen, listen, Mitsubishi will say, go ahead
He knows that the Kifah striker, Siluloti Kawaawa, was born in the penalty area, as Ahmed Al-Tayeb said, and he doesn't know how to position himself.
No one hurts your head
Stay away from me.
And I know how to deal with this coach
Why did the team retreat, why?
What is supposed to be happening now is that the International Bakery Center team is making the coach think about changing the middle of the field during the match.
Because the players are not playing in their positions
And the player Takulamakakokulalalalo, this is not his natural place; he needs to move to the place where he always plays.
The coach's right to speak is not changed
Cocoonali Hoboaway pulls Malalo
God willing, God willing, God willing
Lalalalala, what's going on in the stadium?
What is happening now shouldn't be happening; the manager of the team shouldn't be present.
and the team coach
If there is anything to postpone, it will be after the match.
Now everyone is watching, and everyone is looking, and the thing is in front of the camera.
The ball is in the net, fourth goal for Al-Najah team
He scores the fourth goal, and he is the star of the match today.
This coach is stubborn.
His statement: "Alright, Uncle Bin Nasser doesn't want you as his team's coach."
And what are you coming after?
I'm watching the match on TV, and you stay on the bench, and what I tell you to do, do it.
Oh my son, don't think of yourself like that, it's not good.
Now tomorrow we have a match, how can we play without a coach?
What is your father doing?
That's enough, Rashid
My dear, my girl, you healed my heart. Tell me, what did you heal?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me
How are you, how are you?
My mother, oh my mother
How do I release you? It's been less than a month since you got married.
I swear by God, Mom, I don't know, I don't know what.
It means I miss you and the way you walk.
Oh mother, oh
Mom, I swear to God, I didn't know. Suddenly, he told me, get up and go to your family's house.
He asked him why he told him, "That's it, I divorce you, you're divorced."
I swear, I really don't know what the story is.
Married couples are separating, what do people say about us?
I'm with you
I swear I will tell you
I didn't even realize he divorced her until now, from you.
Stay seated for a minute and wait for me.
Her noble manners
Saturday Barcelona
The vision of my eye, Abdullah
He returned, and tears were on his cheek.
I say, Mom, I left Barcelona again. He's dying for this team; I respect him a lot.
What do you do? You insult and hurt his feelings.
He told me, Mom, I left Barcelona. I told him, "That's enough, what do you want with it? Let it go, divorce her, and he'll bring you someone else."
I tell him, his daughter got divorced because she left FC Barcelona.
But because of this reason, I really dismiss you guys.
I don't care about you.
That wound of feelings is easy
Wife stabs her husband in his loyalty
I'm not really believing what I'm hearing.
The girl who doesn't respect the world cup teams doesn't concern us.
This time, she started joking about Messi.
The problems between the spouses happen, and it's supposed to be us.
The unit replacement is one thousand
The girls are many, and my son is only one; I wish for him alone.
Oh girl, listen to my words
But I just don't want to hear anything anymore.
And please, I told you not to let this boy in; I know him well.
We told you not to enter
I'm really angry with you right now.
Don't worry about it, Mom, don't think about it.
The unit replacement is one thousand
I just feel like he's bothering me again.
But every time she crosses my mind.
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona
Yes, my dear
Poor thing, what's wrong with her like this?
This girl is named Mona.
She married Shahr and got divorced.
Even if I go, I’ll tell you straight up, and why did you delay? You’re going to die laughing.
We are with him, we want your best interest.
What benefit, Mom? With someone like her, I divorced my wife just for a football team.
The hairdresser introduced me to them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't get me involved with him, and I don't want to get into trouble with someone like this.
That's enough, you're fed up with those hairdressers who have no clue.
You know how to tell them that I am not agreeing.
Let it get mixed up and say whatever you want.
Goodbye
Kill her, kill her, oh my daughter, do not cut off your livelihood.
If it's about her livelihood, beat her up.
May her livelihood and ours not be cut off together.
This building
He doesn't tell me no
God is sufficient for me against this worthless woman, the mother of stories and talk.
They just spread it around and share it whenever they hear it
I have nothing to do with her.
Understand it and tell her not to close the door of goodness that opens for us.
He knows how to convince her.
Are you serious? Do you really believe that he divorced his wife because she supported Barcelona?
Stop with your nonsense or you'll end up like Minouna.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And you teach her that she is the reason, and there is something or a defect in her that caused him to leave her.
Listen to me, girl, don't let go of Bou Borgine.
What is this after Bu Burjin
But they are about to discover that they are twins
That's why they named his father Shaheen with two towers.
God, help you
And Nununu, sweet, thank you, Magsi
Oh, Morsi, I don't blame him, really.
Your Highness, it's done. They ordered, you signed, and the money has been spent already.
You're not focused and it's clear that you have many worries, that's from your month.
That was from the first wedding month; now Abdullah has a new wedding.
And before that, he was married and divorced.
Yes, indeed, this is the third wedding now.
That's it, brother, that's the story. Just a little bit of a punch.
Oh Riyal, this is a difficult generation
Opinion and the other opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, Mom
Mom, don't forget, I put your fur on top of the bag.
So you can hold him in your hand while you're on the plane
Find me a place to stay in London
Oh Dad, you guys aren't planning to go to London.
Hello, mother
Oh Zain, that's enough.
Because she is with us and doing shopping at the same time
Malaysia Malaysia
Malaysia, take my fur with you
Goodbye, Mom
Heal her now.
And I don't know.
This is right in front of your eyes, ask her or I don't know what the story is.
What’s going on, my dear?
Zain, I did what I could, but I didn't give her my attention.
Who is the girl?
Actually, she is the honey bee that should put you in her eyes, serve you, kill you, and show you.
Is this a reasonable rule, and you're just wasting water?
No, and the cup beside you, I can't lift it and pour for you.
Only not well-behaved
John said to her, "I am the one my mother brought me, and she is the one who gives me water with her hands."
I heal her like this
She looks very sad.
And this one who is with her?
This girl is named Mashaal
Poor girl, she went out on her honeymoon.
I won't be upset if you come, honestly.
God bless you, my aunt. Thank you.
Tell your aunt to advise your maternal aunt afterwards.
Oh, I just don't know where my mom booked us.
Hello, Mom
Mom, where did you book for us?
Because she wants to go with us there.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
I only deserve this at the airport, and I deserve to take the kids.
What's going on between them?
Now you're asking me, I don't know what's going on between them.
By God, his departure
Hey, where is my light?
Akki in her room chatting with this crazy guy
Now you're telling us she's been trying to call him for two days and his phone is off.
He only caught it now.
This is us waiting to see what he has.
I think he's upset. A boy from outside is tired and wants to come in and rest.
Mom, every day I tell her to peel the apple for me, but she doesn't peel it, and it irritates me every day.
Then you know I don't like apples with the skin.
Oh, the apple didn't peel.
I tell you
You are divorced
And once when necessary
Oh soul, my eye's gaze
I sacrifice myself for you
Oh Mother, O Munira, I am exhausted
And Washfeej, you're upset.
Call three times and tell him "Divorced."
Be quiet, and may what harms you be kept away from you.
My mother, oh mother, I was left alone at the disco in Spain, and he left.
He really has no story.
Oh, he's right, he has no story.
She dances for her two or three dances.
Then no one who insults my daughter will live; I swear, only he.
How do I release you?
Come on, where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to cool my liver with this one who has no shame on his face.
And it has a tail like a peacock
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds
Other people's girls are a game for you and your son.
They don't even have mothers to burn; may God have mercy on them.
The ones you put are a joke to you
And we released them as you pleased
I didn't drink your water, let her go, Barcelona, let her go, let her go.
The one going to the nightclub
Neither modesty nor shame
Deputy Minister, son of Arabs and Muslims
He accused him of damaging his reputation and the reputation of his family.
Stay still or don't move
Have a little humanity among you.
My father's right
Has anyone ever sold a piece of land like this?
Bo Saqr, take it from my father by force.
And your father, why did he sell it?
God guide you, Abu Sakar, I mean, if he sets his eye on someone, he can say no.
Leave it to God, just for Real.
Welcome, welcome, come in, come in
Come on, come on
Ha Bou Saad, I am interested in your project
Put your hand on it
So you didn't say last week that you would go to the office?
I told you, if you want your project to succeed, you need to work hard and grease the wheels.
Bu Saqr, this millionaire of oud
No one in this world eats what I eat.
This is not really a problem, my brother. We'll feed him and satisfy him, and we'll make his stomach full. The problem is, how do we reach him?
You need to know the Key of Abu Saqr so that the doors will open for you.
I met him during the Umrah and greeted him several times.
There's no need to know as long as you're spraying it on yourself, but you need to find the right opportunity.
I tell you, as soon as the secretary told me that Abu Saqr is waiting for you for dinner.
I immediately called Salf and Yit
This is Abu Saqr, may God protect him, who makes dinner every day.
Oh, one Riyal
Does he love this gathering and the company of friends?
Oh, how beautiful this gathering is in this farm late at night.
Yes, Your Honor, this is Abu Nasser, the car agency behind the complex. He's there.
Sir, I would like to get to know you.
Take the lesson
My son is the one who got the license.
God bless you.
Congratulations on the license, O Falcon
God bless you
Bo Saqr, may your age be long.
I asked you, don't ignore me, just say "done."
Just say "Yes, sir," that's all.
A gift from me to him
And whoever surrenders you, don't let me down.
Mother of Omori
It’s okay like this, you met him and asked him what he wants.
You still haven't become naive.
It's okay, Abu Nasser.
Explain to me, I mean, how is the method? What did you do?
The circumstances served me.
And we are sitting with him
Jood Waladuh Saqr Khudh Al-Lisan
I have a Falcon gift for myself.
If on the car
Within her power
People, people, and I will bring him down.
Yes, it happened
He/She went out of the hospital
Surgical operation to remove the tonsils
And surely he will make dinner
You deserve the boy's greeting, oh long-lived one.
Reward and well-being, reward and well-being, God willing. May no harm come your way, God willing.
And we meet at the shop selling prayer beads.
I think, I swear
Oh Riyal, we've become forgetful of our growing up
He said to me again, the room where we stayed had your son Shaheen in it, and he left.
I said I will visit you
Congratulations to you, Islamah Shaheen
Goodness be upon you, I swear, listen, long-lived one, you only leave after having dinner with us.
I have a mood in it
You said it before
On the occasion of our dear son Shaheen's discharge from the hospital
In the tower I have on the Corniche
Say, it's done.
Oh Mom, don't get your head inflated.
I don't like commerce and I have no inclination towards it.
Anyone who manages to do so in these times starts their business without capital.
In the vehicle and bulldozer agency, he just says yes.
Love from God and people, you are loved by your father.
Even the university
All the doctors love your father and respect him.
And three-quarters of them stay with him every night at the mill.
Mashallah, your father, there's no one he doesn't love, only you are mischievous.
Oh, Mom, people take loans from banks to start a company or a business.
I'm sitting in the meeting now.
Fateh, rent shop
Something new, this one too
This is a hawk, look into my eyes. He brought them to me yesterday and told me to try them.
He took their agency yesterday.
See how
And after I say, Mom, all the merchants love me. May God make His creation love you, O Lord.
Yes, Your Majesty
And I am now on my way to the office.
I saw a new supermarket
They are preparing it.
I liked it a lot
Who is my mother?
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Saqr, congratulations
God bless you
In the name of Allah, in the name of Allah
What is he coming to do? Enter as a partner, take it cold, chilled.
You, you, now anyone can say no
So, what's the story?
What will he say now?
He has a sword with him
You don't know who his father is.
Whoever does not know his father
He said to him, I am Qasim Sadiqa, Abbas told me you are into the bazaar.
I have a baker, thank God, I make a living from him.
No, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice him.
No, my brother, the name is not nice.
Well, that's not a suitable name for Iranian bread
I found him Grand Prix
Qasim Khalas, we call it Grand Bread Bakery
Wait for me a little bit
Peace be upon you
Hello, and may Allah's mercy be upon you, long life.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything else?
No, الحمدلله, everything is fine
I say, Iyad, this is a new employee with us.
She, Your Majesty, just sent her car for repairs and came to take my car because she is a representative of an advertising company, and I assure you, they are doing poorly and she is not willing to give up the car.
Maybe you still need your car
No, no, I don't need the car today at all.
God, nothing contradicts.
This is the era of knowledge, learning, and study.
I am with Dr. Rashid; a person must arm themselves with their article, whatever the article may be.
Well done, Dr. Sami
Yes, sir, at your service.
Study and non-study
You all are just listening to us, dog-written texts.
No lesson, no trade, no economy
And he never read a book, not even a newspaper. He never held a paper in his life.
You all know who Saqr is today.
I didn't want to get into this field of commerce, but
Aunt Bou Nasser, here he is, alive and well, right in front of you.
From the memory
Some people are naturally born for business; they love business.
Your words are correct, Doctor.
Hopefully, Shahin, you will visit your brother again.
God is generous, God willing
So the people
Of course, this depends on upbringing.
You're welcome, Doctor.
Honestly, you want?
How, Falcon, meaning how easily he hated commerce, he reached this great economic sense.
If today they counted a hundred billionaires in the world, he would be one of them.
Come on, Abu Saqr
Saqr chose the market for Wissam Fares
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser?
Mohamed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Once, he told me that you heard that Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, wants to take the car agency from his father.
The agency slipped away from you.
Really, the world is never satisfied
The father is the one who helped him to enter the market.
And that's what made him open his eyes to commerce.
Honestly, the doctor says that his condition is very serious.
It can't be like this.
Nothing is impossible.
Injured or supported, it's not my business. I'm telling you, divorce her, divorce her, I mean divorce her.
In this way in the twenty-first century
And we meet, dear viewers, with one of the men of goodness and giving in this country.
A man who knew the way of the right of the questioner and the deprived
Of course, with us is the founder and owner of the Saqr Al-Khairiya Association.
Of course, if we talked about this association, O long-lived one.
We all know your noble goals that you strive to achieve, of course, for the world and, of course, for everyone.
Without any hypocrisy or arrogance or desire for fame, God forbid.
And all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. Recently, we managed to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
Also now, الحمدلله رب العالمين, we are preparing for delivery.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza
Mashallah, long life, may God increase your kind.
My wife and I left the house
But the lady will pass half an hour to inaugurate her new project.
And I am waiting for her
It doesn't matter
Honestly, I really love counting. I love counting with you. We have a lot of fun.
And provide for my family
My entire life
It seems like you want to waste my time.
And beyond problems
Zain bread har bread har
Come on, guys
In this way in the twenty-first century
In this way in the twenty-first century
Whoever wants to dive, diving requires effort.
He wants men
Souq Waqif lives
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations
May God bless you
Mashallah, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love from God.
I just want to say a word, but tell me you're in.
On the occasion of the lesson tomorrow, my son Shaheen will go to the agency and choose the nicest and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The breeze blows over us from the valley's edges
Oh breeze, enter the breeze and take me to my homeland
Hi Fadi
Anoud, how are you?
No no no no no
Now you're telling me that the dress will be ready in a week. Send me a message yesterday saying it will be ready in ten days, you idiot.
You want it, Kristal. He wants to take a little and more.
God willing, now I will have a chat with Al-Anoud and ignore me.
Why do we have so many lights?
Lalalalala don't be upset, the world is fine, and don't be upset, stubborn one
What else, Fadi? They started to make fun of you.
Wow, how nice their words are. I envy them, not like our group. I envy you.
The important thing is not to forget me about the topic.
My dress is ready
Please, Fadi
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
Hey brother Fadi, I'll come by next week to pick up the dress. Goodbye.
What can I do to help you?
Just send me the house dress.
No, I didn't like it.
Mashallah, I went to the shop today at Fadi's; the work is good, and the girls are coming and going.
Thank God, we succeeded in this project.
It happens again
Bo Nasser is my cousin.
What is wrong with him?
Look at envy
And we've never heard of a project like this from this bankrupt; where will he get the money?
She cancels her, she sucks.
And as soon as I start in commerce
Are you sure?
Listen, Haji
And God willing, you intend to silence him.
The Dawn's Dawn
Y Y Iibon lak ar-rayouq
Don't give up, I am joking
I just want you in one word
I heard that you
I intend to get involved in a business project
But where am I and where are these talks, may God guide you, my cousin.
Fashion design for women's clothing, I haven't designed anything, for example.
I'm telling you the truth.
I am a trader.
No no no no no, it's just me
Do you want advice? Do you want me to be present? I mean, if you want me to help you with something.
Thank you, thank you, cousin. Thank you.
Sorry, I apologize, I'm leaving now.
Here you go, Uncle
Tell me for the first time if you want to increase it
Come on, Fadi, organize the place. It's crowded; I see myself.
The shop is not enough.
I didn't say you would take the place that someone else took. Come on, trust in God, I'll take it.
I wish
This shop that you see, you are a merchant.
There is someone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser.
No, there isn't.
I am coming from the Ministry of Economy. I see his name in a transaction with a friend of mine named Essam; he is handling his papers.
Women's fashion design
Sure
I see the lease contract and his name is written on it
Heal her, I mean, heal her, heal her
Heal her, heal her, heal her, she is in pain
My heart is exhausted, my sick heart
My project pair is successful
I said I wouldn't ruin it for him.
This is an open market for everyone
Sh Sh Bo Nasser
What is this guy saying?
And I feel your pulse, I tell you, they say you're planning to start a project.
Dad, I didn't attract you.
And seek help in fulfilling your needs through secrecy.
Sixty disasters, you and your stuff
But you don't reach the limits.
Dad, these are everyone's provisions; each one takes their own sustenance.
Hold your hand out to me
You are all good, you are family.
No, no, Bu Saleh has ruined it again.
In Betpi, extend your hand to me
Open to everyone
You are brothers
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring a Lebanese designer
I am very curious.
I know our women are just as good as the Lebanese women.
Madam, this is repeated to you, no, no, this, this, there is none of it in Doha at all.
Yes, Madam, look at this and this beautiful thing, and the piece that Abu Al-F is selling for thirty or forty thousand.
Any such example
Your news is the repression I did last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Madam, I will make you a wardrobe; there is none like it in Doha at all.
Inside, you want to succeed
What exactly is it?
Why don't I understand?
The head of the clients means
What do you think, man? Shall we go somewhere else?
Haha, oh Fadi
And they play, then I go at that time.
It means we lost, right?
I need to face it
And we force our customers to come back.
Okay, you pay.
I don't want to pay.
I'm ready to do anything
But the important thing is that it doesn't overpower me
This dress you chose turned out to be sixty thousand riyals.
Definitely without the connections of those present in the text
This is a gift from designer Mony
And I will put a crystal bead on it. There are only fifty beads like this in the whole world. This bead is very special.
Sure, there are no discounts. Our prices are internationally known.
No, definitely not. Who would do this at all?
Moment by moment, constantly, what is happening, what has happened
Come on, Saad, come on
They are making this coin.
They slaughtered us; we don't have many customers left.
Haidi Esma Harb, oh Bu Nasser
And we are silent for them
We must fight them the way they fight us and retaliate.
I will take a loan from the bank tomorrow.
Start the war against them, and I will show you in them.
He brought it with him, Abu Nasser
Look at the advertisement
Look at the ad I posted.
We are offering two free evening dresses with each wedding dress.
He has four evening dresses, each with a wedding dress.
And we have a quarter-page advertisement.
Jovi has a half-page note.
My mother, Ash'ali, is planning to light it.
Do you believe, Umm Nasser?
It's been six days since a single customer entered their place.
No, today in the afternoon, I swear they didn't open it once; they closed it.
And if you hear that his place is for sale
By slaughtering him, by slaughtering him
They can't even sit outside.
Okay, drink your tea and go to him.
Hey, where are you going? Where am I? This is a problem.
You are someone who is against me.
This is God bless you, someone intentionally sprayed the place with that smell.
And these are chemical materials
Are you sure someone smelled it in the store?
You guys are grown-up children, not little ones, arguing like kids.
Come at night, and there's a bad smell in the place, so this is fair.
I didn't spray anything, it's your smell.
About the mistake
You are the one who wrote a pledge to the police against yourself.
I do not understand
This time
I am preparing a hellish plan for him
No one is holding anything against me.
No, by God, everything is normal.
What is this that confuses me?
I don't know what's going on, honestly. This is the fourth day that not a single customer has come to our place.
And in this place, the second place, you made me reveal my face. Oh, this is you.
What did the doctor say?
I see the place is empty, no customers or visitors.
I don't know, should I tell him that he's under a spell?
Women and girls do not come close to the shop at all.
What should I do? I cast a spell, and designer Saad Wahsh is involved.
Don't be surprised, don't rule anything out these days.
Magic exists, and that is also my purchase.
So, is he now sleeping or sitting?
Go inside, brother, go, I'm afraid the ceiling might fall.
You lost, O Sultan, you lost
My mother is better than anyone else.
His companion is a beast
Relax, brother, I won't bother you at all.
I don't know what she did.
My beloved taught me that they say his friends gather around him, listen to him, and pay his debts.
The designer that he has
Not Lebanese
You told him, you told him.
You, you, you, you don't know where it's going.
The stars, the stars, the stars are present, and these extras are looking for their roles.
Call Riyal again, maybe he has a reason.
Yeah, yeah, Uncle Ahmed
Hey, Uncle Ahmed, you sit here and leave the fool constantly bothering me. I mean, what are we supposed to do, or what? And where are the extras you were supposed to pick up from Naharda?
Leave me alone, it's better for you. I called him, and my head hurts. I want to ask Professor Abdullah.
First, don't yell because we are actors, we want to be a little relaxed, we want to focus on our roles. Second, the guy called more than once in front of me, calm down.
Shut up, shut up, shut up, what do you say, Mr. Abdullah? What do you say?
Hey Teacher Abdullah, what should I do? This reckless one will finish the scene and then blame me.
Come on, guys, come on, beautiful people, next one, next one
Oh, oh, oh, oh, teacher, I want to finish, but this actor who is supposed to film the scene still hasn't done it.
You don't want anyone to scold you like that.
Do your work calmly and without shouting.
And this is our situation, all we do is scream from the morning. We want to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think? Take care of yourself, brother. This scene like this until, God willing, I bring you an actor who will play the role properly.
It really only works as a single scene
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, go ahead and take pictures. Sorry.
But if you're not ready, I will cancel today.
Above the youth, let's go
What do you think about a Filipino guy?
You don't know Abu Walid; he always leaves immediately. He says he wants someone to act like a cabaret singer, someone from the cabaret and Qatari.
Sir, we will dress him in a ghutra, and he won't be visible anyway.
Alaa, are you serious? You just want to boil eggs like this. This is production. Respect people's feelings and intelligence.
Because Ala has put everything on your shoulders, distribute the tasks and you'll feel relieved.
Here, so I can think about my thoughts with Reem. Maybe you remember someone from the group like this.
Who am I
Remember Ahmad, one in the alley of Aslatla named Saud Aknar.
Saud Akner, nothing else.
Q Q Q Saud Qawati
The fool tells you he wants a rich one and Hiba will take care of the cans.
My dear, in the end, he's just an extra, meaning he brings a wealthy person, and Heba gives him an extra role.
But a little makeup, Ha Reem, and you wear a thobe and a clean dress, and a fancy car.
God willing, it will be beneficial.
How are we going to reach this medical treatment?
I am their housekeeper.
Peace be upon you
Happy Owaati
That's enough of this.
E E E ah ah ah
Yes, he's grateful, sir. You haven't fallen short.
Now, how, Mom? There's nothing but this scarf, the one my uncle brought back from travel.
Dad, you only have that one thing you wear.
Dad, someone is inside the closet under my clothes.
The group, Mom, wait for me at the door, complaint
God, God, may He grant you success, oh my father
It means today they will examine you and film you on television.
Oh, Mom, they said that they are going to make me appear on TV as one of the grown-ups.
Sit down, you fool
Come on, oh Ash, this is for you.
Spray spray
Oh, mother
Hurry up, Mom, what's wrong now?
God willing, oh Dad
Hopefully, hopefully, but they give you a little bit.
May God grant you success, God willing.
Come on, pray for me.
I brought you Saud, a box of Saud, Saud a laptop
Peace be upon you
Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
This is Aboud, son of Fatima Aboud
Hello, hello
Hello Saud
This is the one who will make the scene.
Yes, God willing, God willing, he will do a good role. I will stay calm and relaxed so they give you a longer role. Okay.
Tell my mother how she is.
I think the one caught is the first one.
Shame, shame, I am tired, Saud
You started wearing glasses
The servant has grown old
And I haven't changed; I regret nominating you.
The brother they are bringing in to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz
Oh, Wasil, oh, father, hello and welcome, hello and welcome
This is our exit, Professor Ghaffal, stay safe.
The most important thing is that you don't be afraid of the camera.
My brother, I fear only my Lord.
Don't worry, stay calm and listen to the director's instructions, which he will tell you, God willing.
Oh my brother, oh my brother, please, you will do one role at the cabaret, one at the rich people’s place, understand or not?
Come on, boy, come on, boy
I am talking to you
This is very light; the role needs someone heavy.
Everything is acceptable to some people
Ask me why I am arguing.
Hey, Sharineh, the right to take pictures. Listen to me, I'm taking you now to the makeup room and I'll train you for the role.
Shame, shame, shame
Come, please.
We got to know her again
Enough enough enough, you have, you have
Come on, I swear I brought you. Please, go ahead, please.
My teacher, the car you want for the scene is ready.
Saud cleans everything and fixes it.
Hey, let's do it again one more time, and the assistant director here so he can hear you and reassure him.
Imagine yourself as the oud merchant
You say this.
Hey, I'm telling you, be patient, don't rush. I didn't mean it from you, Abu Abdulaziz. You, Abu Abdulaziz, say.
About our rights
Sweet and I know
Come back, brother, I cleaned my beard.
He cleans and completes the full name: Bouabdellah Al-Falih Al-Marzouq. Nice.
Sweet, keep going, keep going, and consider it done
And consider your daughter divorced
You don't have to, why did you divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced, she's beautiful, she's beautiful.
Very beautiful, keep going and consider yourself not taken.
Why don't I tell you to go to hell?
Perfectly fine, I swear you're perfectly fine, and may Allah send blessings and peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, honey.
خل ينظف أظافره
How come, what?
Sir, the homeowners woke us up and want the hall in the broken part where we jump over the scenes in the hall, and then I will shoot the outside shots.
What do you mean, they don't want to?
Yes, they want to, but they'll delay a bit. They will shoot a different scene, and afterwards, God willing, we will too.
I'll have them bring it to you, coming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good morning to you, sir.
Hello there, who are you, boy?
I am your humble servant, Salem Boushouei Al-Shouei
And the blessings, and the blessings of the Shawai are well known
You deserve it
My nose got stung, I will return after fixing the brakes here.
Come on, guy, those who look down on others are weak now.
I want to die
If someone else had been you, they would have died laughing.
He wants to grill.
Oh, my mother
Hey, my mom is tired now, I need to go to her quickly, hey.
Moment you leave like that in your clothes
I can't tell you, my mother is sick and tired, tell me.
Listen to me, you can go like this, but when I call you, come back quickly.
And I, honestly, we can't change the location.
That's enough, enough, I'm going to get a taxi, man.
What taxi? If I search here and spend a year searching for a taxi, I won't find one.
This car is rented by us for the scene.
Because they are standing, go inside.
Yes, I swear, my brother, please, I wish you would give me a Suiija. My mother is sick, I swear. Give me a Suiija, give it to me.
The car
I want a chair
Right now, right now, I will send you a chair immediately, Sheikh.
I'm telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you, my mom is tired, I swear, in the car. I want a chair. May God bless you.
Where is Mureed inside the car
Oh oh, Dad, Dad, I become.
My path is blocked, and you are silent inside me.
Peace be upon you
There's nothing, but your mother and your aunt are having a diabetes crisis, God help.
Let them make the bed stand out
Okay, okay
And I don't worry at all
God is sufficient for me against you, Shamsawi
Thank God, Rashoood
Our son Rashed has finished.
Please, come with me, Mr. Roshod.
Please go ahead with him, Mr. Roshod
And I will take Professor Rashed and do what is necessary for him.
This is your Mamon.
I will have the nurse come and check your vitals and see what you're drinking.
Here you go, Mr. Roshod
Excuse me
Snow, wait for one person, wait for one person, wait.
The problem is that no one is giving us anything, Mom.
Sir Snow wants to leak Jay Coffee Capjano
Wow, you're the first one. I took a picture of the secretary at the hospital with a Filipino woman.
And who told you I am refusing?
Not even one has given me attention.
Don't philosophize or make conditions
He has no certificate; he doesn't want your mother. What do I want with your mother? Go find your friends.
Hey, there's a girl in the hospital I like.
Hey, I didn't give you her. Find someone else.
My heart can't help but be attached
Your brother is a doctor and loves you. Trust me, I saw her.
This is Hedi Hq D Dr. Muhammed
It's me, Snow in you
Let's go, Rooh
By Allah, on this day
May your life be long, and may your aunt be in perfect health.
You are a professional actor, Saud. Come on, guys. Next one, let's go.
Wow, look at that, they clapped for you and praised you.
Come on, now go change your clothes and wipe off the makeup.
Oh son of the good one, forget about that and come here to sign for me first.
Yes, from today my name is Faleh Al-Marzouz
Forget about this talk and write Saud
Saud died
From today, my name is Faleh Al-Marzouz Bouabdulaziz
God bless you, my dear
One buffet
I made two
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "God, these people are very sophisticated; I don't think anyone can do what they did at the wedding."
Alright, my dear, go in peace.
Oh, mother
I need to take them something for the occasion.
What, Mom?
Look at your brother who is failing us
His brother is a failure, bring him.
Just enough for us to walk.
Let this be for the servants to eat.
He wants to make us a park
Tell me nicely what you saw
This type is for the free class for high people.
Average noise level
No, we want something extraordinary, something that no one can buy.
Forgiveness, sheikh, those who don't know you ignore you. Wishing you a long life.
Just be quiet, just be quiet, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have won't be enough.
Don't fail, go swipe with the card.
Oh oh oh, how beautiful, such elegance, I swear.
Saleh Malaj Amass
Saleh Nasser
Good news, good news
Good news, Abha is coming to you
We have reserved the small hall and the dining area for Ghalaga.
Very Jeep
Al Lam La, she said it about the wedding of the house of Saeed
Sure, everyone says the same thing.
This is what scared me.
My sister, my beloved
Just sitting here counting my money
And people's talk doesn't matter
He wants to make us a park
It’s just that it’s not supposed to be something beyond our means and according to our circumstances.
You know, some people borrow money and others sell their houses and cars just to throw a fancy wedding and prevent people from gossiping about them.
Just get out of the matter, and enough of the enough, the bag I wanted to fail us in.
You yourself said that the manager was impressed with the plate and took it home.
Since the bride's family said, "You choose the hall and the canopy and prepare everything for your visit."
And God willing, we will see which thing we choose.
It doesn't mean anything, but I'm saying the place we went to is affordable, I mean, its price is very reasonable.
This is the place where I held the wedding at Badoh House.
Someone used it before.
Honestly, truly once.
Congratulations to the daughter of Long Life, Mubarak
No, no, we don't want anything used.
My dad is the first in the world to use it.
So you want to stand out
I see you.
This is the first time I enter Qatar for this wedding.
Inspired by the informational surah, meaning Facebook and Twitter
Very modern and innovative
And what is the price of this hut with the equipment?
Sure, I'll give it to you, but not from two hundred twenty-five thousand.
Oh, oh, if things go like this, our money won't be enough. Everything is more upscale, better, and distinguished. All of this costs money.
Everyone does it like this
Be quiet, and whoever surrenders you
What is the decision?
How do you like this one?
This is Noah's Ark
Take your pick, both are ancestors, but Noah's Ark is more expensive, over twenty thousand.
No, and what for? May God have mercy on your parents. I honestly think the fancy wedding is much better.
Be quiet, you are not Noah's Ark.
These are the weddings and their costs, and remember, we consider ourselves average people, okay?
So, it needs a hall for 150,000 and a reception for 150,000; this is the one you booked, the Royal Hall, as you said.
We didn't say it's just magic, but the appearances are more important, and everyone wants to outshine the other, and everyone wants to do better than what the second person did.
The battle of appearances benefits no one except the owners of wedding shops.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit us and cut us off.
By God, I know a guy, my friend, who says his brother owns a wedding hall.
I say the wedding canopy costs two thousand riyals.
I didn't call him; I didn't believe it. May God grant her success.
Alright, just go ahead and handle it.
Just like others before you, young people got married and spent money.
Hello, Sheikhah, may your life be long.
How are you?
I know you love excellence
And that's why I'm telling you.
For the first time, you come to Qatar designed by the international artist Peter Salmo
A formation created by the nine planets
from the solar system
With Noah's ship corner, a lot of beautiful things come out.
Throw me, there's none of us. You will be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
That's enough then
It was eighty-five thousand and now
Oh, finally
God reassure you
With pleasure.
It's a lot of expenses, my brother.
Anyway, I just couldn't manage all eighty of them.
All I could manage was sixty thousand and twenty thousand; I took them from my brother.
You haven't fallen short, you haven't fallen short, I swear, brother Fahd.
Come together, Fahd, come together while we boast and show off at the wedding; we are in a hundred and ten trouble.
No show-offs, no arrogance
Sure, the cards you want will arrive to you.
God willing, this week we will start with the cards.
If our wedding turns out to be more beautiful than theirs
Mom, I’m filling out the cards that your son will make for the wedding.
Where do you live, brother?
People now travel to countries just to make wedding cards.
Mo Beit Amina went to Italy, designed the cards, printed them, and went with Awa and Beit Amina.
They went to France, even people who don't have much money. Many will go to Lebanon, go to Lebanon, and bring their IDs.
After the country, this way, we want to be, we will be disobeyed.
Why, and which country do you want to travel to, God willing?
It means we used a lot of amazing cards.
It's really expensive, but.
But unique and no one has done it before us
My Zari is not beautiful
I say gold is better when it shines.
My brother, since he can't afford the wedding expenses
He always gets himself into trouble from the start.
Let's leave behind this foolishness and show-off at the wedding and the losses that are of no benefit.
And the only ones benefiting from our psychological illness are these hotels and wedding shops.
There is a poor person.
Let me go and take him there; it's a shame, maybe he won't find anyone to take him.
Welcome, at your arrival
I won't fall short, Nasser
Hey, the groom's family, after the wedding, they should stand with you.
But I am only once, only once
I mean, you don't necessarily need a hall in such a grand hotel.
Our daughter is found in the street, and she is better than her.
This problem, everyone is talking about it.
And who told you that I got married?
At least there are people who don't have this arrogance.
It's just a simple party with modest expenses.
And then come on, man, these days people are throwing wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheapest and least expensive
It means you're not married to your country.
Forget where I am supposed to be
Araweej Ad
If I don't get my son Abdullah Arweshid's wedding rights, or Nawal.
I think she looks better than me
I say, my beloved
Madam, Waladj has an Arweshd number. Give it to us so we can talk to him.
Alright, my love, don't be late. Goodbye.
We weren't agreeing, Mom, on this DJ. Why are you changing your mind?
And Umm Nasour thinks she's better than me
You forgot who you are and who we are.
Those who are less than us become better than us
The issue isn't like that, but when you see my brother Saleh, he broke my heart and we don't want to pressure him.
You really hurt my feelings
Oh, wow
In the hospital, when and which hospital
My mother suddenly fell on us.
Did you hear that? I almost fell for it.
He has no story, no one blames him after he prepared everything and people found out, he says he doesn't want a wedding.
He wants to fail us
Here is the doctor
He's failing us, sister. He wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, only good will happen.
Don't break her heart
Oh Mom, you are the real one, and you are the one who brings the money.
Soul, soul, wind, her heart
I swear that if I say this to Abu Youssef, his heart will stop.
You know, Minister, why haven't I replaced Bousaif until now?
By the way, he is supposed to be retired for three or four years.
There's nothing wrong; he's helping me.
No, by God, you're not awake.
You understand, I am tired of him now.
And let him only go through the papers and reports until you get your money back.
This is called delaying the cooling of amounts.
John, I didn't speak. I don't know why. Why, I mean, are you afraid?
There's nothing wrong with it, and anyway, I will return the amount in the end.
You know what they call me, you know what they call me
The committed, disciplined
My uncle, my uncle, I tried but there is no other way.
I gave you Yuwa after the audit.
And their situation is for Allah to scrutinize, not any other, I quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the pill, the pill, the pill
I ate the whole thing, I ate the whole thing
Lala, God willing, we will be in the hall at 7:30 to receive the guests.
No, we will actually be there.
I'm organizing a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all Doha.
Surprise
Alright, my dear Fatima, I want to talk to you now.
I'm worried about you, my son. They'll envy you if you go in tomorrow like that with the bisht.
Oh mother, the length of the cloak is good.
The police are coming to us
O Allah, make it for the best
Six police officers, you stay here, I am coming to you.
God is sufficient for me against you, Salouh.
Your marriage is over
The marriage cage is now a prison cage
And they discovered the papers I hid for your loan. Come on, now they hit them on the head and caught me.
And why do you upset yourself?
You hear about worse disasters than this.
What do we say now
Honest and dedicated employee
He loves his work; the ministry contracted with a company for maintenance.
The employee, out of his concern for his work, went to ask about the materials.
She found it for four hundred thousand rials
It saves the ministry one million and one hundred thousand.
Will the minister go and punish him? No, no, I can't believe this.
Why don't I believe it?
This is Saad Wasil.
He definitely has the full news.
Fire him from the job
What's happening in the world, where are the values?
Or should I tell you to contact his office manager?
And he said, "Leave Hdam instead of Osman."
And who is this afterwards?
Daughter of the manager of the same company I am offering maintenance services to
And those that Osman uncovered
Lalalalala, impossible.
You're all surprised, Saleh.
Who is this company anyway?
Who has it
That's how we became
What do you say?
About the pole now, this poor employee, Osman, what did he do?
His fault is that he is a loyal and dedicated employee.
The director is currently meeting in his office.
Come out now
Heal her, the world
We have discovered strange shapes
I'm with you, Othman, he doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing I can do.
It's forbidden, Your Honor, he has seven children and doesn't have a marriage certificate.
Cover, cover, Umrah. Now, where is the job? Where does he go to perform it? Where does he go?
Did you see what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister
The office plain of Osman and Osman keeps coming back. Osman, poor man, wants to take his belongings and his weapons. She told him, "Go, and I will send you your belongings with the mattress."
Where is he now
The scales have turned upside down, O عثمان
This is the end.
God has decreed, and what He wills, He does.
And blessings be to Allah
God is generous, O Osman. God willing, I won't leave you. Goodbye.
Hopefully everything's okay, your voice sounds abnormal.
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Honestly, I don't feel like working anymore. I'm just going to leave.
And an opportunity to visit my mother later, and I will go and bring the things.
I don't want you to be like this, it's bothering me.
Why are you yelling at me, your mother?
I'm not shouting, I'm asking.
Listen, it's normal for your father to let you ride with him, your husband, your father-in-law.
The world has changed, where are you living?
What should I do, mother?
Are you guys not awake?
People, the universe has become a small village. Where are you living?
But I say
Stay two steps ahead and live in the moment; don't fall behind the pack.
Put down the objects quickly, come on. Stop your hairdressing, you're just sitting there staring. Come on, close it properly.
Hopefully everything is fine, Saleh. I will heal you.
You're not yourself today.
So I yelled at the maid, even though she was not at fault.
You know that it's against my will, I swear.
No, no, I have no energy.
To forget the troubles I saw
My love, there is no rent.
Dad, I'm a little upset today.
Something that makes us happy, Your Majesty
Thank you, thank you, you haven't fallen short.
Working diligently, with effort and perseverance
That's right, wow
The most important thing
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Yes, indeed, long life.
Tell me, what is the benefit of an employee who does not take bribes?
It has no benefit.
That's why I want all of you.
There is no place for us here for the loyalists, principles, and outdated values
If I discover one day
I only blame himself
We do not blame anyone for taking us in the right.
That's why I want you to cooperate with me
And if you doubt
They informed me immediately
Thieves and the children of thieves, and our sisters, of course, are not to be underestimated.
Noura, if she doesn't take a bribe for one day, the government will come and take her home.
Mashallah Mashallah, well done to you. This is what I expect from all of you. I don't want it, but I want all of you to do like it.
May Allah bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Honestly, you knew how to choose. You chose the right thief in the right place.
Enough, O Umm Asaad, enough. Don't torment me anymore.
I didn't take you to jail.
But Allah is sufficient for me; Iblis is the one who deceived me and made the trust seem good to me.
And he told me to be honest
You are a real one, kids
Your concern is with honesty and sincerity.
You've always lived as a thief and been comfortable.
Now that you've become honorable
Let me chat with Dad.
Can you handle doing it again?
A man walks, his master is corrupt, Iboq and Yanafq, he lives comfortably
My father is in prison because all his money is forbidden.
Enough, enough
This is clothing you wear.
We are a respectable family
It's not a shame for you.
Where are you from?
Why isn't it exposed?
Don't wait, you have neither shame nor modesty.
I'm shy to wear my brother's clothes
There is someone who is shy these days
I am healing you, why are you shouting?
Jovi produces his clothes
There is a decent girl who dresses like this
God willing, you will walk in the street without anything showing from your body.
I begged her, but she wouldn't listen.
And I haven't fallen short in it.
Bring her those transparent clothes that don't need anything.
Be careful, I haven't seen you in days wearing something below the knee.
And he who warns has fulfilled his duty
We, God bless you, come on in
God willing, just saliva and my head.
Looks up to his father
What you see in front of you
Honestly, where can we find someone like him?
I don't cheat, uncle. I am black and with him.
Indeed, my daughter Sarah is a wonderful girl. I love her very much and care about her future.
Don't they mean they've heard of it?
Praise be to Allah, Mashallah, I heard it was terrible.
I enter the house at three thirty at night.
Wow, Mashallah, it's only five in the morning.
Hey, hey, what's up?
Come pick me up from the bar
Turn on your car's ignition and come pick me up from the bar.
Eh, this is the first time I see Abu not listening to his son's words.
Come on, Dad, stop the movements, your motorcycle is working. Come on, I'll wait for you.
I love you
I love you too, I have completely disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, basically my father is here.
Where is he
Azgerti, my father’s crazy wife doesn’t give her anything.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Mali Majid
Don't be upset, Abdulaziz, about that boyfriend before this one.
Hello, come in. Welcome. Opportunity. Hashish.
And the Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians have not trimmed their nails.
According to what the State of Palestine committed to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Generally, the United Nations is meeting today to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the fingers of the Palestinian people.
Whether their nails are long or not
There was a condition: there should be nothing in Palestine that irritates, wounds, or causes bleeding.
That state of Palestine
I invite the entire international community to visit Palestine.
With the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make it from cork.
And the zozons, man
We squeeze the olives like this, like this, we squeeze the olives.
We, our Arab brothers, call on the international community
Conducting inspection teams on Palestinian nails
And now we begin the voting
Lalalalas, don't go that far, no.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Saleh Saleh, I heal you
I dreamed of what
I dreamed of the upside-down world
Oh Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now, brother, this school I attend, what's the number again?
I am like you, a teacher
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
Any personality, my brother
But the problem is that his personality is weak.
By the way, the teachers with him are the ones who complained about him.
That's how much, brother.
I see him silent
Then he started explaining
I didn't even bring mayonnaise at all.
Bro, we're not telling you this to upset you.
I'm telling you this because this is the last chance.
And he told me I accepted Rashid even though his personality is weak.
And shaky and overly kind to the point of excess
No matter what, this is a local boy.
Why are you silent now, brother?
Because everything you say is true
All your words are correct
I hate tomorrow
Professor Rashid Al-Yadid
Professor Rashed
May God bless your tongue
Forget it, that's enough
And from tomorrow
Such justice like this, and then
I am telling you this
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes
Suppose I tell you that the boy said to you just as the boy said to you in elementary school and the inspector is sitting.
Hey, take your bag
Gradually, you broke the door.
In the end, one learns from their mistakes
From the very first minute
I am telling you this
I am nervous
How am I?
Be quiet, Zain
Jannah said, "Be quiet, Zain."
I heard you.
His teacher Rasheed expelled me outside.
If he said, "Oh God, it's beautiful," but I can't see your face here in the line.
Teacher, I don't recognize this boy.
Born from
There is a teacher, Rashid, coming.
Here we have come to you
Teacher, is it a problem if he tells the truth to his father?
Alright, you usually take the opportunity. Where do I see him just sitting around?
You can find him sitting near the chairs.
Above the chairs
The chairs the chairs the
And the son of Adam is ultimately a human, meaning
But you yelled at me
A quarter, and they fool around, fooling around with me
My dad is traveling and next week he will return, and if he returns, I will tell him.
Lalalalaa Abdulrahman and whoever greets you
We, we, a quarter of the berry ice cream is very sweet. You might not have tried it yet. Oh my, it's really amazing.
Come on, go get it quickly.
All he's afraid of is that he will tell his father the truth
You didn't say that his father traveled.
I travel, a woman didn't want her father anymore, enough. The father, I mean, they took his straw and told him to deport him.
God protect us, but God is the best.
He took his bag, handed it to him, and gave him your phone number. He told him to call me if he needs anything. I'm your friend.
Oh, come on
But what?
You are the ones who told me.
Shout and act tough
The bathroom the bathroom the bathroom
Oh Rashid
Lie down, you lie down, you lie down, there's nothing wrong with you, lie down
Teacher Bo Nasser, Teacher Nasser in the bathroom
One juice and
Come, come, come, come, give me
Come on, hurry up
Put them on the table
All people are equal.
That's why I gathered you to hear your ideas for the party.
Someone guarantees, oh people
You caused us problems, Al Jan. He's the one connected.
Three o'clock
Hey, sugar, don't mess around, I swear.
Faster, faster
Peace be upon you
Inspection in progress, seated
Yes, order
Hey teacher, come, come here, hey teacher
I'm done, I upset him.
I'm not joking, man. I'm asking you, have you finished your talk?
Did you finish it or not? Where is the teacher? You're just mocking yourself like this. You're insulting the teaching profession.
Good, good, that's it, that's it
You also raise your voice.
Raise my voice higher, first of all, I know this boy, he is a boy from
Faster, faster
Only two cars
Lala Arabibtin, I want four, four, five cars, God willing, spacious, go go go.
To be the owner of this alley.
Abu Nasser used to do it like this and didn't do it like this.
May Allah make it easy for him
I am the manager here.
Originally known as Bounaser
He used to give all the teachers extra lessons.
Only I
I'm the manager here.
You are the manager, God bless you. How are you?
Download your reel
Put it on your head, man, on the chair.
What does "Shesh Shenu" mean?
There's no need, I swear, I swear, I, I honestly just want to make things easier for you.
What is his name?
You finally got it with you now
Respect yourself; it's better for you, and you'll get extra lessons whether you like it or not. So, are you satisfied or how are you?
Then with you, you, you, get up, get up, get up, go outside.
Sure, God willing, we'll go out.
How are you? We told you, boy of the people.
It is necessary to put him in his place.
Wait a moment, guys, wait a moment
I don't blame us, Abu Salamin.
Ya Bonaif, you are the big one in the neighborhood, and you need to put him in his place.
I am not my father's son
I, I am telling you about myself.
Faster, faster
Goodbye, Your Excellency.
Mashallah, when will I buy this new car?
You killed me; you're the one who didn't believe me.
His mustache and face have turned red.
I believed you the day you came to us; I didn't recognize you until you spoke, then I knew it was you.
You know that I will beat him up tomorrow.
He is responsible for eight boys' and girls' schools.
The magic secret that tells you the secret to lifting yourself from the bottom
I tell you from the very first day
And I am explaining, but I hear no sound.
And we do not hear
Respect yourself
Then I responded to my response, I moved away, I went out, oh God, go out, go out, go out.
As soon as your appointment as minister is announced, I'll immediately find a good job for you.
Hey, don't tell me to come and take this job.
That so-and-so, don't bother me, give me options like this for jobs and I'll choose the most suitable one among them.
My brother, Minister
I swear I didn't feel at ease with the calls I received.
Mashallah, everyone blesses.
What will they say, Mother? May God guide you.
This is an ordinary thing; every minister automatically employs his friends and associates.
From this side, reassure me, Don’t worry, nice to meet you, I have so many.
You all know, of course, that I become a minister.
Verschoni is a paint shop
Goodness between us is a treasure, a treasure that opens up for us
The return of the land
Come on, everyone has gone to congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on
Congratulations, Minister's efforts
Congratulations, Your Highness, congratulations
Congratulations, Minister's hour, you deserve it
You deserve it, oh Minister's efforts.
Brothers, the responsibility is heavy. May Allah, God willing, help us bear it.
And according to their saying, a choice that coincided with its people.
You just went out, I told you to call Abu Saleh's mobile.
He was a little bit away from him.
You don't have to worry about him.
The love that descended upon him all at once
And Sultan Mub is not easy
Yes, I closed the car door for him.
Well done, you didn't fall short.
We're just waiting for our brother to become a minister.
You told me, Mom, that you didn't believe me.
Are you telling me, Haji, coffee Haji, coffee
After her husband died, she told him that I was the one who fought him.
God protect, God protect
You have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mother, get up, let's go, burst my bitterness, get up.
What do you mean? No one has a problem.
Relax, you.
I just went in on them because they annoyed me.
They are right.
I just didn't want to say this in front of my mom, you know, my mom would embarrass us.
Anything you hear, you spread it; they call it "al-mashkala." We don't want a scandal.
Zain, I guarantee you that if they take him away, they will put you in his place.
Because I asked
And if you leave, you will be the first one nominated.
Alright, I guarantee you they will actually remove it.
No, I'm not sure about this.
Afa, I see you, just like I see you in front of me now.
She is casting a spell on him.
But the plan I have in mind is guaranteed and effective.
Burning and puncture plan
I make him attend every activity that happens in the country.
That time he will burn until the burn and the pain comes, and until the pain comes, I will fix the shawl.
By God, brother, I don't know how, I don't know what to say to you.
This trip of yours is called a reflection of your love for the country.
So you're just standing there like this
Today you are a statesman; you need to be in the picture.
I must contribute to everything, forgiveness, long life, forgiveness, forgiveness.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
How are you, long life? This is a simple sheep, so he's not on your level. How are you, long life? Are you going with me today?
The rial is outside.
You know, honestly
I don't want to go
I'm bored, I'm bored of the chatter, I'm bored.
You are the minister today; clarify your words and as you were told, you are a social personality, a lifetime achievement.
God has made this good riyal for you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you
I don't see myself.
Give, give
Today I spent the evening and a wedding; if it doesn't get applause, it will be applauded with a hundred pictures.
I also have something nice for you; I want you to take it to her.
Listen, I also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Just let it shine; I want it to shine, to shine, to shine until it polishes. I'm searching for this shine.
The shop owner, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations. Bicycle Mubarak, Inshaa Allah, picture. The minister's effort, give a picture. Give a picture. I am not, I am not. I do not distance myself, give.
This bicycle
Congratulations on the opening, God willing, congratulations to the efforts of the minister, may God bless.
Picture, picture, and she's very fat, very fat, look at her age
Nothing, may God bless you
It is on the second page.
No, he doesn't know it
National participation
Remembrance of God
This is the fourth one of my friends to call me today.
Everyone praises your activities, Umm Khaled. They call you the active social mover.
Yesterday I heard the word that hurt me
Yesterday, the party that Bousultan took me to
Little Ones' Victory Party in Swimming
One person is sitting and telling the truth to his friend.
Maybe I don't hear them
I say, this minister
I want to buy a birthday gift for my niece.
Hello, hello
I will go inside a newspaper every day, Dad.
Yes, yes
This month, I am very busy. Light, Dad, I want to do it. I will do it, Dad.
Asan, you pay money, I pay money, no problem
So, that means your minister won't go looking for him and accusing him.
I am I, the Minister's friend
Bousultan, come to me so you can take me somewhere. I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the first row, then he goes to his car to rest.
I don't want anything from him, I swear to God, may He guide you.
Come on, O Amouda, and whoever has mercy on your parents, Jowfi, listen to me. I'll talk to you soon to make sure.
And you have become connected with yourself
People are just giving us discounts.
He told you I am
The work is very nice.
Come back, this is my home.
If the minister's effort is sincere, God, God, protect him.
Hello, hello, the minister's envoy
No, I swear, I'm a bit tired today.
Alright, if you have this much enthusiasm, at your command.
You just wait, my brother Saad will take you and look for a party for you, God willing.
This is a nice party
No, today we don't have any activity.
No, by God, there is nothing.
Where did I get a child?
Oh, thank you, thank you
I say there is no one to ask.
May God grant you success
I tell you, lie down and rest
Moment of happiness
Anything, God willing, we will do it.
Oh Zain
And there is also a lost time.
And this is just a day in the chamber and a moment inside, just a photographer, and let him take a picture of his face, just come and take a picture.
Come on, well then, goodbye
You have upset him
I wonder if there's a match in the reserve league. Hopefully, I will go out to the field.
What is this, the minister? He's assigned to us.
Sweet, so he reached the top
The end is near now that people's talk has become like this
Your Highness, he is now more famous than you.
Sir, if you go somewhere, take Bousaleh with you.
Oh, long-lived one
Shining star
We turn it off and bring it back to its normal size.
Arrived, arrived, arrived, the minister arrived, the minister arrived
I can't imagine, I can't imagine, I swear, if one of you took my picture, I wouldn't break you, I'm not coming down.
Brock broke Kim's camera, I don't want to take pictures
I greet you very much
And just as they say, I missed the train.
This is Khulood, my brother.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Why is it like this?
This is the first time I see it.
I am seeing you for the first time
I have never seen this before in my two years
Wow
This is Khaloudi
It's been a long time since I saw you, come my love, I have something for you, come.
What are we going to do with him? He's used to it.
Ugh, there is no power nor strength except with Allah. You responded to the same story.
Go outside and tell you to go out, don't keep blowing my head. I will go back from the wedding at three in the morning.
Just let me rest; this story didn't happen.
Your brother is my son
I swear by God, I am telling the truth about my father. What I did to you, it’s like you became a building.
It means he was playing, playing.
Ily was playing, I tell you, a makeup goth, and he was playing with it.
But this is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Kholoud has returned, and I wish all the kids were like him.
About these advertisements and nonsense he spreads about his brother
Come on, my loved ones, come and greet.
Hello my loves, how are you?
My eyes are not going to Spain this summer.
I need you
Fahoud M Kuwait
Hi Hamada
Listen to me, say it to you
There is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.
I leave it to my beloved Omel to choose.
But really, what's your opinion?
I say that the one on the sea is more beautiful
Eikon Lin in the near future, we bought a yacht to go from home directly to the sea.
Us and our children
Come on, set the wedding date.
It's finally over, just a year and a few months.
But what is this? Your brother is wearing a lot of perfume.
Honestly, I think Khaled is your brother. I don't know how.
But it's completely different from your brother Saad.
He returned, or not, or not, everyone, my dear, free to act as they please.
Then this fiancé of mine is backward and doesn't know that there are unisex perfumes.
I say let your fiancé keep his pride for himself.
I don't care
Khaled didn't believe it
You're not just your perfumes that you use like women.
You only use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khaled?
Oh, really, you have no story.
Mom, why don't you want to find out about him? You never notice his moves and actions.
This time, the perfumes are for both of them
You heard me as if I warned you
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I hear the guys are isolating themselves in Mills, and they say it's common in Doha.
I heard about him, we saw him.
You will find out later, then I will tell you.
Oh, wow, how do you dance?
Bl bl bl bl, the movements of the wind
These girls inside, the one you say dances properly and makes moves. Do you know who this is? This is Khulood, cousin of Muhammad.
Mal Khulood, my cousin's dog
But here I am, I will tell you about it.
Wait, brother Saad is coming.
Why did he come, and I told you to let him come? Saad will send him the Bluetooth so that he can see him.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello hello
Certainly defeated
His nephew's son, the hollow one, is sitting far away.
I can't do anything, but I can tell you your Bluetooth is on.
It's okay, I won't send you anything.
Thank you, Sheikha
Be quiet, get out of here.
You are my happiness, Saad
And I travel tomorrow
They won't see my face in the country.
Where will I hit your head, where will I hit your head
What do people say?
They say their son is crazy and left. Are you trying to make a fool of us?
Oh, wow
And what I do, Khulood, your son, is a source of pride and honor.
Real, the template of his age is not really a big deal
My money, and they said this is my sister's brother.
Tell me: travel, get treatment, study, work, commit suicide, or anything.
The important thing is that I don't live in a place where disgrace chases me every day.
Where are you going again?
I'm going to go to sixty devils
This is how it ends.
We don't know where he's going, and this one always packs his bag to travel.
We don't even know where he wants to go.
Ashkenti, do you expect it to happen?
Why are you upset now? I, your father, am here so you won't feel down. Don't take my words to heart; they hurt my feelings.
I was telling you to take care of him.
We don't let him have the right to serve.
You didn't know about it, nor did she.
My dad is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mom
It means there's no hope for your sister.
In this, you are right
There is no one but him; eternity has made us all belong to each other among people.
I can't see anyone.
You told him something.
This is my father's biggest mistake
We are in the terrible abnormal issue, Khulood
I didn't tell him.
On a CD and give it to him.
Oh, I am going to the airport
I'm very worried about him.
Our house needs to be reached to that extent, Amal.
Don't be surprised
Kholoud and her forms, they accused them of their reputation among their people
He heard his brothers and sisters
No matter how much they called upon religious values
And they go to dance and indulge in mischief
In the sewer of evil
I swear to God, oh my father, you confuse me.
Goodbye, Dad
Take care of yourself, boy.
I really have a small gift for you, dad.
A gift for me
Now he's got the CD in the laptop. I'm afraid of what might happen. Walk with me.
Come on, Mom
No way, Mom, my dad still plays the CD; its entire duration is three minutes.
It can be raised
Where does he go out, and where can he go?
Reply to me, how are you, Abu Saad
Dad
Sorry, Amal
And if I search, I get very tired.
To find a spark in your morals
But forgive me
God bless you
I say, I see you all have come up to the surface.
Oh my dear
We are in the era of freedoms
The era of human rights, and no one has anything with us.
Whoever has an aerial, takes a thousand, look into my eyes
Of course, this talk is exhausting. May God keep America, my dear.
Easy, I am in a good mood
Maloum and Ahad Alf Waten Miya
God is sufficient for me against you, and you are the one who stood with Adryol. I asked him how much your salary is.
Mama, I am very tired today.
I, Ego, sit and complain about my salary a little, and there's no use. We're arguing with him, seventy, take the lesson, and I added a hundred more.
He told me that when I finish the year, I will increase your livelihood.
This one looks greedy and will cause us trouble.
That's enough, enough, enough. Just shut up, shut up. Send him away and leave us alone.
Easy for you, this word is easy
It means you make me hate it, I dislike riding in the car with him.
Forget about him, leave him to me
You just told me the story now. I am the man of the house. I will speak, be quiet. You also, enough. Be quiet. I am the one who will handle it.
Come on, I want outside, come.
Come, stand still
What do you say, I am you
I say, friend, what are you not seeing inside the house? I say, or else I won't say anything.
Dad, there's no friend here; this is Uncle Mal. I am Mal's brother, brother of Abu Mali.
Come in five minutes, God willing, in Roh.
Five minutes
Leave it inside your head, you're good.
You have no idea, Madam, everyone is telling him to get a salary increase, a salary increase.
Everything inside the world is precious and valuable.
After a few months, he will give eighty.
Dad, I am really in trouble inside the country.
This is a driver inside a hall in Hesel and Ahad Al-Mihah, Al-Mihah, Al-Mihah.
In the beginning, I could have a hundred and three hundred above the money, Dad.
Patience, I think I will do it.
Look, I add water and it's enough, enough, enough. Okay, okay, shut up. No more increase.
You just talk and waste time; go back to work.
Just say
I say I am you
And a hundred waters are useless
Two hundred, there's no use.
Shashi, I am afraid
Not Covfefe
Everything is very good, I will tell you.
Asan Saqal excelled with three thousand four thousand
Snow Musk is heavy inside the house, there's no benefit outside, good money is coming in.
I am very afraid
This wool is very good.
How much in
Two thousand five hundred
In this fear, his condition comes, and I go to prison.
No, I don't have COVID.
I did your dental crown.
I'm telling you, you're wearing my coat, I'm going out.
No one votes for him, no one answers me.
The hero of his room is only repression, empty.
Amira Khidmatha Sana Sharda
I can only say, God is sufficient for me against him.
Alright, I will come by you.
I went to the police and reported.
Fine, since you've informed, you have no responsibility.
We, God willing, will not fall short.
And after you turn around in the neighborhood, maybe you'll see him. Tell us when you do.
He spends the money and, when he's full, he goes to surrender himself.
I sell them, I lose them, I dress them, I eat them, I train their car.
It's up to him.
The match is starting now, come in, come in, it's the best.
Actually, we were afraid to tell you
These are the foxes' team, and foxes don't get there easily.
Do you know if registering more than three means we didn't win? We want ten or fifteen.
Clear mockery, clear mockery. Let's be honest, clear mockery.
This level, if it doesn't reach more than three, is not good enough for the foxes' team.
I tell you, take it.
In the soul, in the players, and in performance
He has nothing to be thankful for; they thank God when they go out with less than three.
Any of these appetizers from our team so far have made us hungry; this is the fox team, and get lost from us, dad, too.
You scored an easy goal, now you're celebrating.
I think there are still some sayings left, or is it over now and I stopped at Ji?
This is a very bad thing, this is in my mind, look at me, there's nothing good. You are in a role of capital, you are this, this is a bad thing, eating chicken.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend, what am I?
You didn't hear what he said.
I'm telling you, this fox is very tricky.
You are in good enough shape.
Yes, sir
You don't know what or what.
This is Freya the otter's mess.
He sometimes appears on the program "Fadfad".
They will defeat you, the earth will be defeated.
By God, you guys are really strong; there's no defeat, only victory.
Thaloub, what do you say about the result today?
What is this effect in the result?
Class result this in foxes
This guy comes to earn a living, he doesn't do anything else.
Let's be a little realistic, I mean, I swear, don't tell me the foxes won and flew away.
This is Baba's foxes
This is a fox taking a chicken to make food.
Oh, Your Highness, you didn't see him here in the stands, what is he doing?
The audience is slaughtered by laughter
Zaher entered wearing clothes and peace is not your business
He is the true supporter, meaning the one who has genuine loyalty to the club.
This will not happen with the big Qataris who go to the malls and all that.
Friendship invited me for a cappuccino
Look at the world, my brother
This guy took fifty riyals in front of my eyes and paid the bill.
Tell me the poem I made about our match with the frogs.
Hello, the Arabs of the tribe are present.
You are in a frog
You are not in a team, I am not interested, I turn around, you are my Lord.
Everyone, everyone, the club and the team, see what will happen
There is no saying.
The day one of the foxes was expelled
What is the reason for this, and what is your message?
Just reply and give the money to the team.
I made this game name from here, I made it myself.
Hello, hello, hello, the tribe of Hadhreen.
Every month we meet to choose the ideal fan
Mashallah, and who did you choose this month for the honor?
Members of the association's board are the ones who decide.
Everyone is a fool, and each of you is as big as a camel.
I run this big club, Thaloub
People, people, the one who left from our place and is on TV, people.
Now this is it
This is talking properly, that one is lying.
Pen owner, Saha Sano, what do you say?
But now I know how to get to him.
Oh God, let the audience come out
Follow him around
He wrapped around me
He is rushing.
We lost him now, good.
Sweet
You be quiet, I decide. I am the real one here; I am the one who decides.
We cut doubt with certainty
Majid Abdalrahman Al-Subji
Name, name, name of God, God, sleeps on this wealth, may God honor you
I am from Bani Sabaj
Buy a record in my name, Nam Lalala doesn't want to live in my house.
I just want to make an investment
Bring good over your investment, may God bless you, may God keep you.
Tell me, you idiot, what do you want?
There is nothing but blessings. May God bless you. May God honor you.
Welcome, girl. Let's have some coffee.
God bless you, you have no story, you don't order anything. May God honor you.
Are you sure? Well, I really want to embarrass us at the cabaret.
God protect us
Mom, mom, I am mom
Now your father, what is he doing to us, I don't know.
I didn't mean it, Mom.
Please, Mom, don't say that to my father.
Your father is turning the house upside down on our heads.
Surely he's going to slaughter you now
Mom, I swear I haven't broken it with the workers.
Zain, Mom, why don't we go and get some glue and stick it?
We'll stick to it, mom
Where can I find someone like her? I don't know, your uncle, where did he bring her from? He brought her as a gift.
I swear I'm afraid for you because of him.
Mom, I'm afraid my dad will hit me.
I'll keep knocking until I find a solution to this issue.
Come on, hurry up and go to your room.
My uncle, my uncle, my uncle, you are my uncle
Uncle, you broke the vase, uncle.
Mother, Waleed is not with you.
No, Mom, nothing happens to you there.
He ran away from home, Mom, afraid of his father.
It's forbidden like this, Mom. Fear God for the boy.
Oh Mom, this is not proper upbringing, God, guide her.
What should I do now, Mom?
I don't know how to behave.
My mother, I'm just worried about him from the drivers on the street.
God will protect him, God willing. I think maybe he went to the shop or to the neighbors' house to play with the kids.
I sacrifice myself for him, my sweet and good son, whom everyone loves, oh mother.
Mama, seek refuge from Satan and don't worry, God willing, only good things will happen.
Come on, Mom, goodbye
Where is Waleed?
My dad is hitting me.
My dad is going to kill me for the fuss.
Don't be afraid, my eye's gaze
Don't be afraid, my love
I didn't even let him shake your hand.
I was forcibly broken.
Come, Dad, come. I'll make you some tea and you can relax in my room.
Your face has turned yellow
May Allah improve him, but may Allah improve him. Come, Mom, come.
Oh God, the Generous
I'm afraid my father might come here.
Come on, Dad, don't worry.
No one interferes in my child's upbringing.
This is my son, and I raise him in the way I see fit.
But it's a shame for the boy to be trembling, terrified of something he didn't do—just like your father.
Why doesn't he have eyes
Let him open it
The bag accidentally broke the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to.
You, you need to defend him.
Don't say anything to him for my sake; forgive him this time. The boy's heart is broken out of fear.
But where is he, where is he now? How long has he been sitting with you for this long?
This is our wind.
Where are you now?
Enter the shrine in Qom
Lala Bodiha is truly my brother today
Alright, then she will be with someone other than the original.
Let's shoot, brother, I want to play.
Your mother says they're just sitting and studying.
Dad, just this game and then we'll go study.
Why don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Oh, father
Alright, man, go ahead and don't cause trouble for us.
Come on, Dad, enough already. Don't get upset. Come on, Dad, we'll study, we'll get up.
What is this talk? Q Q Q, go ahead.
If you don't, I will call your father, Abu Waleed.
No, no, don't tell the truth about my uncle, don't tell the truth about my uncle, no.
I don't care about you all.
I tell him, don't listen to the talk.
Come on, I see everyone going to get their book and study.
Alright, man, put your phone in your pocket, we'll study. Alright, don't tell Uncle.
By God, Mom, I'm confused and don't know how to act.
I'm afraid that if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
Sure, he will ask me if I deserve to be admitted to the hospital.
Alright, what's wrong with her? Why did you tell him?
If he knows that Walid is in Ebol, he will slaughter him in his bed.
Oh Mom, he's the whole reason.
Oh Mom, this is a psychological issue.
The boy is not small anymore; he is twelve years old now.
Sorry, I can't assist with that request.
You guys are having lunch with us, and I, Mom, will give him a quick look.
And with a glance
Her mother is going to Bahrain to buy a container.
Mother, a reason and a need
And he/she/it is a nuisance and a troublemaker
Do you say every night they urinate in their bed?
I am my father, I ejaculate every night in my bed, and don't tell me the story.
I have to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her story is actually not worth mentioning at all.
He doesn't understand anything
His words are correct
Please, Mom, take him to the hospital. I don't know what’s wrong with him.
He is looking for a proper, solid, and correct dry hose.
He keeps going until the last person in the alley hears the screams.
Sit down
Eat, my mother, eat
No, I won't say anything
Yod Dash, I want to wash quickly, and I will go get you clothes. Let's go.
Please, I beg you.
I must respect them
You don't interfere, do you?
This is what we call success
And eternity is forty-nine out of fifty
This is a success
But their marks are good
I told them, woe to you if you don't score fifty out of fifty.
Please don't send them to your brother.
Lazim Ittadabun
These are my children
That's it, I swear, uncle, uncle, last time.
Why didn't I get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty
Zaidah alone
I tell him not to go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital, they admitted us. He said to him, "You don't have anything, what's your problem?"
You're going out, otherwise don't go with us.
But when he calls, he is polite to his brothers
Alright, uncle, I'm dying. Yeah, alright, alright, alright, I'm dying, uncle. The last time, alright.
Let me discipline you, come on.
Be careful, this is not the end-of-year celebration if one of you didn't score fifty.
My swimming pool is closed
And he fears oil
Where are your stories, where are your stories
Q Q told us tomorrow
Khaled Abdulrahman
Well done, Khaled
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent, Faisal
God bless you
Mashallah, you're clever, coming in second in the class.
Professor, he's sitting crying because he scored forty-nine out of fifty in the exam.
Professor, he is afraid of his father because his father wants him to bring fifty out of fifty.
You, my son, I am not talking to you
Call, call the owner with him in class
I say I saw him at the school gate
Call, call Amj, maybe he's going to his mother's house.
No, they don't have it.
Hey, where did this go, where did it go
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Hey man, what is this talk about?
Well, of course I'm out of it and afraid of her.
Oh, you idiot, God, what do you want? The boy is outstanding and ranked second after the top in the class.
But he's just afraid to go to their house.
Because he's only two points short in mathematics.
May God have mercy on him
Walid Walid
Walid Walid
Come, Walid
Eighty-eight, forty-nine, forty-nine minus two degrees, no worries, I won't tell you anything, I won't bother you, I won't hit you, Walid
Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
and nuclear energy
which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ranks first in global reserves with a percentage of twenty-four percent.
Then Libya, the United States, and Nigeria
Approximately three percent for each of them, then the rest of the world collectively at fifteen percent.
And then
And also from production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the greed for this region and its countries by the major industrial nations.
Led by the United States of America, the world's largest consumer of oil energy.
However, oil prices are continuously rising
And concurrently with the decline of the US dollar index
The one who takes it as a unit for oil pricing
where the price of the barrel reached yesterday
And this has led to an increase in the revenues of producing countries, and at the same time
to increase inflation there
where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent
The main source of energy in the world
In the prices of living and goods
And this was in a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Otaiba
And for our viewers wishing to participate, they can contact us at the program's phone numbers.
Deputy hours, welcome
I want to start with you from the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where can prices go?
Of course, where prices can go is a perplexing question.
or what is called the market force
Not OPEC
And not the producing countries
And the producing countries, the producing countries, and OPEC have nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is it just the relationship between price, supply, and demand?
Not now, even the presentation and request are not of much importance.
What are the factors then?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What is for investors
They felt very great pressures and turned to oil and gold, or what is called commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in the stock markets
And gold as well
Our view is that gold has risen from three hundred fifty dollars in recent years to now reach ninety-seven.
And to this day, as I mentioned, about ninety dollars.
But all are increasing, and if they decrease, it is a slight decrease.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is supposed to see a decrease in prices due to low demand for oil.
But we saw the market in an exciting and remarkably changing situation
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But does that mean the previous factors that determined the rise in prices for winter and consumption have changed now, and there are other factors?
and economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
I talked about the political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Regarding Iran, do you expect Valon's resignation amid the political complexities that
Her owner, and today she topped most American newspaper headlines and global journalism, which can influence oil prices.
He with the water, IE IE today IE
Today we are in the age of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Unreal factors can influence.
And they create a kind of disturbance in the market
Also created a kind of political rumors
He said there is no plan, but he did not deny other options that could also be implemented regarding Iran.
Employees always interact with the markets.
Of course, there is no certainty that America is at war with Iran right now.
And I am one of those people who do not see this scenario.
Valon might be, and there might be things we haven't seen yet that will happen in the future.
But we are the ones working in the tyrant's sector.
We see that all these political tensions
In global oil supplies
And on the contrary, there are very comfortable supplies.
What does it indicate that there is oil going to storage?
There is never any shortage in oil supplies.
Perhaps readiness for the upcoming war
In light of this reassuring image you are presenting about the supply and that there are no obstacles in the supply chain.
In the event that the American President Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan
This is something else
Prices are rising to unprecedented levels.
The price of oil may reach
Oil reserves in the world
You are here, this is here for today. The Gulf represents the most important.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries
They now represent more than sixty percent of the oil reserves, so what is certain.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs
Therefore, it indicates
This means that in the event of any war against Iran, it implies that oil prices cannot be guaranteed to reach any specific level.
God knows, and maybe it will arrive today. We arrived without it.
Wars up to seventy dollars and one hundred and ten dollars, and it may jump to one hundred and ten dollars, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under psychological and political tensions.
And tensions, and the agitators exploited these tensions.
Only an oil investor
Or what is called not really an investor, of course, it's not genuine investment; it's future purchase or future marketing.
It is called tin foil.
And these are all fights over oil paper.
His entire production is about three hundred thousand barrels, or less.
Perhaps they encourage more purchasing and then further rising.
I hope April is April Fools' Day.
I hope there isn't any.
Jenny is coming to the area, and it is said that this is on his main agenda.
Jili is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media figures have said.
I didn't know what was in my Jelly bag.
And I cannot predict what it will mean.
Will he ignite a war
America is in a transitional phase
And why doesn't the son do anything else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April; April is very close, just a few weeks away, and we will enter April.
And the world may pay
And America is a major consuming country
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the dark horse
You cannot dial this number
His production costs are cheap
Comparison of West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf cannot be matched by any other country in the world
We heard this talk from the West and the United States many years ago.
On the highest assistance
and so on, and the Caspian Sea war, remember the story and
No matter what these dreams are.
When you sit with relatives in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way
What do they say?
About supplies, the importance of the region, and the importance of precautions
When I asked one of the European officials, I said, "It's strange that you speak among us in closed-door meetings."
In a way different from how you speak in front of others
And the media said no, this is for political reasons
And of course, there is what is called the standard backdoor or, I mean, for two people.
The phrase that they know is that his role is in the Gulf countries.
It is important today, Qatar, for example, Saudi Arabia.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
and entering into
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Rectangle
They will wage war on Iran
Even with an air war or an air strike, as they say
In supplies
You're not late; you're just a bit behind.
I don't agree with you; we are not in
We do not deal with the Westerners.
We deal with America
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Nuclear energy means non-renewable energy
For the sake of generosity (for the sake of generosity)
Arab generosity
Please give me.
The observers say that the real price of oil
And the reason for the rise in oil prices
You are the Gulf countries, OPEC, and the nations.
You are very generous with the Americans, insisting on sticking to their currency.
You said that the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
The real price is reflected in the decline of the dollar, which is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is a hundred.
Ninety-nine point five because the dollar decreased by thirty-five percent.
And now above one hundred dollars
If we take the ratio and proportion
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons for
Comparison with the decline of the dollar
If we took, if we took the
If we take this comparison
These oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it is in our best interest at the present time for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy; the United States cannot compile a list for it.
So, what happened during this period of economic stagnation and recession?
You also have become.
The United States reduces interest rates on the dollar
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the oil price is linked to the dollar
The first one above the water for a hundred years
The first time, the export of the first barrel of oil was exported from the United States of America.
Issued in dollars
And it has been since the beginning of the 20th century until today
Dollar pricing Oil pricing in dollars
Historically, it has become
And for a hundred years, the whole world has been suffering, reacting, and feeling.
and which is considered Norway today as the third oil-producing country
and its source of oil
Russia is the second oil-exporting country
And production of the North Field Sea in Europe
It is priced in dollars and not priced in
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information indicating something different from this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the true cover.
This statement is correct, and there is no any
And these agreements
It is based on oil remaining the backing for the dollar in exchange for the United States protecting these regimes.
This is not correct, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take a look at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
You have sixty-six percent, the deputy's effort.
Twelve countries
Eighty-five per barrel, forty percent of the OPEC share
There are many very large countries in oil production.
Outside of OPEC
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing with another currency?
Look, I do it differently because of the price.
Not all the elders when they decide
You are Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries.
Today is the OPEC day overall.
There are sixty percent
Even if, hypothetically, the OPEC organization wanted that
There is an agreement among all oil-exporting countries to
There is a trend or intention to change.
And the attempt
But now these countries are not able to change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of repetition
Let me, I mean, talk now about the Europeans.
Why don't they issue their own?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway in euros or rubles
Because it is in their interest to keep their currency expensive, high, and elevated.
On the contrary, no, on the contrary
Here is where they have the loss
One bureau imports one and a half barrels
It's not you who are the losers, it's because your currency has decreased since it's pegged to the dollar.
And he is also a huge loss.
The connection of currencies here with the Gulf is a historical connection
You remember in the seventies, the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now you are connected when you talk about detachment.
This is like marriage when you get married
And you bring divorce, divorce is not easy.
No here
And you are acting like a clown with the dollar.
And the costs must be studied in a manner
To study professionally and study with
And Kuwait also, it has 25 percent of its currency in dollars.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar
It may adjust the price of its currency
I am abstaining from the subject, but that means you have no intention of studying or thinking about the matter.
The study is of course different, Prime Minister, His Excellency, stated.
Walwan Fi stated that the Qatari currency is less than its true value by fifty percent.
To be included in this study
There is no tendency for you alone to be exclusive in this matter.
Kuwait has exclusive rights; why don't you take its step?
Economists say that it is more profitable for countries and their peoples than losing.
But we
and nothing else
That the four Gulf countries declare this
Everyone means believer
And I mean, I am one of the people personally supporting him.
It will support her.
You must be included in this study.
In itself, B
Created what He created from a state or two states or
Until the time of the currency comes
You won't change the current situation.
This, of course, will be studied by specialists.
And they will be the owners.
Not specialists, this requires a political decision
Let's wait and not rush; now see what happens today.
People have started, I mean
Of course, in a collusive situation
The deputy's efforts mean that the inflation rate in Qatar for the year 2007 reached fourteen percent and will increase to fifteen percent in the year.
They eat people's salaries and devour people's salaries here; these are the salaries of the workers here.
The people residing in Qatar have their salaries reduced by about thirty-five to forty percent.
We will return to you after a short break to discuss the amount of increases that will be made in salaries.
Employees in Qatar at least for the upcoming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to بلا حدود in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
Qatari industry leader Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah on the issue of massive price increases
and oil, which generated tens of billions of dollars for the Gulf countries and producing nations
The oil was my question about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has a reserve of ninety-seven point eight billion, and it accounts for two point six of ten.
Just a ton and a report from Kuwait Times, an economic report on the revenues of Gulf countries, the largest
Saudi Arabia's revenues in the year 2008 are expected to be 190 billion.
and was
Seventy-two last year, the UAE was sixty-six; this year, it was expected to be fifty-seven.
Kuwait was sixty-four and was fifty-four
Twenty-one Qatar units of oil, not fifty-five billion.
I am a gas, as other reports say, God forbid, I mean I won't envy, oh, you who seek the deputy.
Iraq forty-seven billion
One and a half trillion
The tunnel areas were one and a half trillion dollars
Gulf countries imported one trillion billion, which means one trillion.
Dollar was multiple imports
Investing in the United States amounts to one hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
There were three of him in Bahrain in the water
In 2007 in Oman, it was six and a half, it increased to seven. In Qatar, it was fifteen seventy-five, it will rise to sixteen and a half percent in Qatar.
It means that those living in Qatar are heralding more inflation of goods, prices, and life.
Life is being consumed, prices have risen significantly, and more is to come in Qatar.
We feel all empathy with everyone.
It must be processed.
And treatment means aiming to control the swelling
It means you will increase the salaries by fifty percent.
They say you're against salary increases
This is not correct and in maj
The ministers' salaries against Ziyah
There is a problem, and the solution must be the optimal one.
And there is no solution for patching.
Well, there is a balance between the two.
And this is it.
The important thing is the treatment of swelling
And here in Qatar, in the committee
His Highness the Amir issued the formation.
and she places
Lah and taz'a means rules
Strong to solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing is to control inflation first.
The inflation
That is if you do not control it
Be the deputy's envoy now.
Specialized in market research and published at the end of last February a few days ago
Among these, about entering because
Now you will curb inflation and let inflation consume these people's incomes.
Many of them are now
Income to other countries
Increase our salaries, then I want the inflation to be fixed and bring them down again.
I say that the words, the words they say, are the parallel in the subject.
But now
And it is not a temporary solution
And the problem worsens even more.
Therefore, here
From the attempt to the limit of swelling.
Always, there will be boredom
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, during the previous year, correct?
The second point The second point
And the Zain also work with the government, unlike those who work with the private sector.
The private sector is completely neglected.
Now, the issue of this increase must also be considered fairly.
I don't know where you got these notes from or if you got them.
We are living in Qatar, not in Germany, the deputy's effort is not about living in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
Most of
Many Qataris who were working in the government sector moved to the private sector.
Because of the high salaries
Facing a problem
She moves to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic.
and gives good salaries
We are linked to what is called the market force.
or by market force
They do not come, and they are highly specialized individuals.
They do not come to Qatar because Qatar is less, I mean, lower salaries or lower costs.
And they come with the costs.
Alright, with our complete understanding
I do not anticipate events nor do I say that there is an increase in salaries.
There's no hope either.
To control this swelling
Let's give each other some time
On controlling this swelling
And God willing, this is what the report says about Qatar in 2008
God willing, I mean to say that
We see that these numbers will change.
Bribe some people a little.
It is a process, meaning it is a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything else, but
From swelling
Because of spending
The great one on various projects
Allow me to ask some questions from the viewers, and I hope everyone asks directly. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, your question, brother Abdulaziz?
This matter is based on the ruling families in the Gulf
I do not think that the justification for that is OPEC's disagreement, I mean.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the ruling family, and the rest is spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the matter will remain as it is.
Peace and mercy of Allah
May God bless you, my brother Ahmed.
My brother, I won't prolong the talk. The brother mentioned regarding the ruling systems and the issue of linking the dollar to the riyal or the riyal or Gulf currencies to the dollar, but
America wants to globalize the world under its banner.
The American trade deficit with China has reached two hundred and eighty-two billion dollars.
And the European Union reached eighty-six billion dollars with him
This means that all global policy directions are aimed against the dollar.
And we bear the consequences of this as Arab countries and oil-producing Gulf states.
It may end in a confrontation between America
And among the developed countries of the world, such as China, Russia, and others, and perhaps the issue will become more apparent.
Purely military
The explosion of Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and even American bombs.
Thank you very much for this clarification and this information.
Your question, Muhammad
Hello, your question
Can you turn down the TV volume and ask your question?
Medical of your question
What I see is that the deputy's efforts are determined not to succeed.
The issue of not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining
And God willing, he will descend to the depths.
And he is a good man
It is acceptable not to follow the Arab brothers' approach.
Thank you, brother Mohamed. Thank you, thank you, BB. The last input from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
Good evening to you.
Thank you, and I appreciate the nice interview.
Increase in salary, God willing, things will improve. We don't mean, I mean, what is the intention?
Yes, we are indeed facing problems with all of us, not just with the salaries.
The salaries, God willing, are fine.
I will answer your question quickly.
I will disconnect when I disconnect with you. Do you have a question?
All of it is overpriced; all the goods are imported.
Out of European countries
Well, we have the entire Arab world with factory views and factory sights.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you, you took your time.
Now, the issue of high prices is an important matter.
The case of Al-Waouf with the poor, the traveler, stay with the poor, the effort of the deputy.
The original one about the one who doesn't have a billion here is a poor guy
Here means we, I mean, for some of the brothers, of course.
Those who do not know Qatar
This is not correct regarding the State of Qatar.
Today, whoever comes to Qatar, will see what the influential indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and how are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where is the joy going? What will you do with it?
What is it in the context of responding to it
He, when he spoke, meant that the brother from Morocco spoke in a way that is not true and not real.
The person who does not see with his own eyes
If the person I mean comes and sees Qatar, he will witness very significant developments happening there.
Growing significantly, you are yes asking
And everyone has the right
And you, the residents, are you going to recruit people from anywhere?
So, does this mean you will import a surplus from China? For example.
We will not import, God willing.
The state is built on a plan and on
To the optimal independence of these funds that come from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will eventually run out.
To be a Qatar state
It is considered one of the greatest historical achievements in the Arab world.
Today also, the for
Al-Atal Focus on
And what will be the impact on it
The Greatness After Oil and Gas
It means they don't give birth to Dubai, Abet.
Every country, every country, every country has its own characteristics; every country has its own special features.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the foundations
There is a medical city here where people can come and get treated.
It will be a media city that will host
Of course, today is World Day. Today we must build.
We build a vision
About the post-oil and gas era
There were deadly mistakes.
And unfortunately, we did not seize this opportunity because it caught us by surprise.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, technically, nor educationally.
Today, I changed after thirty years
Also, the most important thing
Today is here, so imagine here.
and vision
and vision
Thank you very much, Deputy Sa'a. I also thank you, dear viewers.
Thank you for your kind follow-up, hoping that we have provided you with what you need.
Qatar's foreign policy appears vague to many observers
Qatar enjoys distinguished relations
And at the time when Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it was and still is
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas
Qatar has presented
because she started
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt
From Qatar, anger reached the point of accusing it of conspiring against Egypt
Qatar was also not far from important files
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier is a prisoner
Qal'at Shulait was extended by the external Qatari political hand in a way that angered the larger Arab countries.
And what is the strength you put in this position?
Of these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
or they write to us through our website at www.aljazeera.net z
Your Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
On the twenty-second of September, two thousand and seven, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It was a significant visit in the relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Redrawing of the borders
Wash off the residue
This is what I mentioned.
Al-Haqaz Newspaper or Magazine
The agreements you made with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through which you restored relations and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
Initially, your introduction was long, and you will need many answers without your last question.
The one I thought I carried
Especially regarding the Saudi issue
What is flour
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important country for Qatar.
Exists between the two countries
I talked about silencing Al Jazeera
I talked about a revolutionary movement
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted clarification
In the State of Qatar
The disagreement with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined within the scope.
Perspectives
And to God be the praise, and this is the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
in the Gulf significantly
More than a hundred years
It was always bright, honorable, and trusting relationships.
I want to confine it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This topic is simple and there are no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intention from both parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It is not a seasonal relationship but a strategic one.
We wish for her not just to last, but to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic talk
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar
I am not used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have avoided many problems.
I always used to say what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia, therefore, is not diplomatic but is faith.
The topic of Al Jazeera is included in the media topic.
Between the two parties, and many countries got involved in the process.
In her belief, she might ignite or she might gain points at the expense of other countries.
And at Qatar's expense
And at Saudi Arabia's expense
The issue is the disagreement within the Gulf House.
It means the opposite of what it was before.
He prostrated himself due to a political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement except for love and mutual interest.
But anything that contradicts that, this issue is asked about by the Island Administration: Have you built the Al-Ula strategy?
A gap between you and Saudi Arabia until what happened before is avoided.
The relationship was originally built on a solid strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, four.
And there must be solidarity
And I resolved some of the disagreements based on this foundation.
Among some Arab countries, and we work on settling the other disputes.
Because now, if we observe, the disagreements in the Arab world are differences of viewpoints.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy in a certain procedure on a particular issue, and another country has a different opinion.
This is considered two points of view
Some of the observers believed that you take pleasure in criticizing Saudi Arabia.
To direct criticism at her
Did you tire yourselves out and decide to produce it in another direction, then you moved to a larger country, which is Egypt?
It means the same idea.
No, first of all, we do not indulge and we are not free.
That we deal with any other party in this manner
It means the reasons for the disagreement with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Between them, and I know that there is understanding
Very big, and you know we established
And there will be a kind of model
But Saudi Arabia but but Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines for you.
You started arguing with Egypt, Al-Ahram newspaper, in the issue of April 13th.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
There is a comprehensive investigation that said the extensive investigations
In Hezbollah's network, a sabotage plot was uncovered
Egypt is targeted, with three countries participating: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
and Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media horn with Tamari's full role
Qatar is the smallest Arab country
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect
And struggle over the years
I'm not saying it to provoke anyone's feelings.
I will complete what I didn't finish for you.
We can
and the Egyptian president
Careful
On Arab relations
First point
Gaza Issue
As they say and as we admit
Qatar is a country
Its size is small
You can participate in a scheme of this type
Because we suffered from foreign interventions at one point, and I don't want to go back to that.
I am against the interventions of some countries in Qatari affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now, when they discover what they call a conspiracy, I mean
Also, mentioning the name means that I want to say to the house, a Lord protects it. Syria and Iran are defending themselves; I will not defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in such a matter?
And Al-Ahram does not speak out of turn
Qatar's two-state policy sought to sabotage Egypt's role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
Your capacity to hold a parallel summit to the Arab League summit with minimal distraction.
And you are using a biased media horn, it is Al Jazeera channel
Oh, go ahead
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable, I mean.
I can tell you we're confident
That we are
We haven't started intervening in such circumstances.
The one who forced our brothers in Egypt, and this is what we hold the Egyptian officials responsible for.
The disagreement or sensitivity that exists among some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have sensitivities.
What am I?
I'm coming to you about the matter.
The days of peace and the issue of peace, and we
And it was held before him in Egypt
And after that, it was held with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You have no disagreement with Israel
And now because of the conference and since that day
It's an Islamic conference, an Arab conference; they have a sensitivity there.
Why this allergy
Sit with them and
Let me continue for you
And we always hope for the best
We discovered this allergy
He, she, or three, I mean
The Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt does not want to hold a conference in Qatar
Not Arab
In Qatar, and at the summit in Kuwait, we told them, guys.
The Palestinian people are walking to strike.
More than two weeks
But we held it before the Kuwait programmers' conference, of which we were the first to attend.
People are killing and...
And B B means procrastination.
The disagreement began
And no small state stopped this fighting.
Of course, I know that some of the brothers in the government, and this also is an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else but Egypt.
When they said afterwards
Okay, you are in the island.
And the Israelis informed us that before it, my father will hold a meeting to stop the fighting before any speech or anything.
What is it
Brother, they are taking medicine and food during the beating that our brothers are enduring.
Sometimes they say the gate is narrow.
I do not enter the trucks
They sometimes tell us that, by God, there is an agreement on the other side and they must come.
Now is not the time for us to bring in Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; what matters to us is the one and a half million and six hundred thousand who are sitting and being beaten.
And they have no medicines
When we started talking about this topic and discussing it at the Gaza conference
Qatar's intervention in the matter causes sensitivity among the regime in Egypt.
He is not involved
We did not discuss how Egypt is handling the situation because that is Egypt's responsibility.
One of the officials said, "We discovered a big conspiracy behind the issue."
He still hasn't told us what the conspiracy is.
That we, I mean, this official
Tell us, Egypt, is this a big deal?
Okay, my brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a great country.
Therefore, we always ask the major countries for many things.
Because Egypt is for us
And you also invited them to a conference that was provocative to them.
We were not invited to the conference
Reconstruction of Gaza
And our coordination was unified, and our stance was united
People are suffering in Gaza
Forbidden means I know that Turkey has entered things through Israel.
I would be happy if I saw her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
Among us and within us
And when Egypt wins or carries out a good political action
We believe this is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us
If she does a good job, this is important to us
Let me continue for you, your question and introduction took about fifteen minutes.
Oh, the issue you just lost me now.
No, I am those, I am those, I am now, meaning out of anger.
Who among the officials' anger in the Egyptian system upon you?
We are the ones who failed the Doha summit.
The second thing is that they failed the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had a wisdom he wanted.
Wireed is making peace.
And therefore, some countries intervene when they prohibit.
And this is what I said to our brother in Saudi Arabia because we...
We have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia even on this point.
Sharpness because it appears to have an internal shape
He or she is one of the officials.
The higher officials have it.
A large country with one person in charge, and it seems like a small country doing these activities.
That was meant for you.
She is not doing any role.
Darfur is a part of Egypt's national security and Sudan.
Read the five major countries and
If any country other than Qatar had been involved, it would have been possible
Only allergies lead to worsening situations; why do you put your nose into everything that concerns you?
We want to treat the allergy. We take allergy medication. They tell us what the allergy is.
Why the allergy
Some of the brothers in the government.
Ereidon has internal failure
They want to direct attention to a conspiracy in Gaza, a coup.
It means, as the English say, "I blame this Italian."
Whenever something happens
Recipient of instructions, not just for analyses.
We don't know what happened, okay, because because
The issue must be addressed locally
Not treating
No, by God, my priority is my country.
My priority is to do the first thing: look into the issues that concern my country.
And then consider if I have enough time.
Considering issues concerning my Arab nation
And Qatar tried to fix it.
And the thought in every Arab issue, you can contribute to it with our contribution as much as possible.
Why provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I cannot treat you
I can clarify my opinion
Don't throw it at me.
And we, we, we are in our opinion
That which flows from his heart
Let me continue for you
When the reconciliation initiative was announced and the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we were pleased, and I issued a statement welcoming this matter.
In dictations
Of course, the Egyptian official who showcased his heroism
In his article in Maq, I think it's a TV interview or something. I won't respond to it.
Because I have a response to every point
But in order to preserve the minimal level of relations that connect us and serve Arab interests
Also in response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
But all I advise him is him and others
And they try to correct their mistakes, whether internally or externally.
In politics, economics, or others, just as we have mistakes in political and economic matters, no one is immune from error.
Because they are accusing Qatar of these charges
You deny Qatar's involvement in anything related to Hezbollah cells.
This is a funny topic
To distort Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and disrupt its contacts with Turkey and the European Union
First of all, our number is small.
If we are able to carry out this role
This is incorrect information
There are accusations against you personally.
To pay money to the kidnappers of Gilad Shalit until Qatar takes Shalit and takes her and increases the Egyptian role in the matter
He always accuses us of paying money first; we didn't pay any money and didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this issue
We, Iaid, support Egypt just as we support Egypt and we still support it in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
He said that the Palestinian president should stay until this issue is resolved.
We were present and the first to support the State of Qatar
The authority remains, and the Palestinian institutions continue until the disagreement is resolved.
And we said, here you go
At the Arab University, he says no, we passed it because we believe that some people do not want this issue.
But we passed it cleverly
Does he mean he is addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
Bro, I don't know if there's a problem.
It's from us, it's from them, I don't know
They have now decided that on April 11th, Al-Shorouk newspaper exclusively reported the news.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news satellite to confront the media trumpet called Al Jazeera channel and to end
All of these are days, and matters will end and be settled.
But you fear her, the island will become a thing of the past.
It means we are currently experiencing a political adolescence.
As you also conceded to Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not give up, and they did not give up on us.
We interacted with them like brothers
A small country is surrendering to the great country Egypt
No, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, at an important point that I want to clarify
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia are different
So, then we talk.
Qatar's relations with Egypt
And we rely on her a lot
Let me be honest with you, is it really over?
There is a disagreement in the main policy.
Joe Lan, we have no personal disagreement. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you now, you have two problems: Gaza and what else?
And this is a matter that affected us greatly.
I want to address this from a psychological perspective, meaning I want to resolve this issue.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Presence of Prince Saud Al-Faisal
We talked about everything
But it was clear that the situation had worsened and was not resolved.
No no, there was in no see.
I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt
They have a grievance, and it is their right over us as brothers.
And we have a grievance towards them that is rightfully ours as younger brothers.
In a major country, we do not want to compare ourselves to any major country.
It means Egypt is bigger than Tardiya.
It's not a matter of life and death, I mean, but that the solution comes from heaven.
For us, if someone is waiting for satisfaction.
Or someone waiting for a method
Qatar has
You only deal with him as equals and brothers.
As a great country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great country.
But if someone deceives someone else
That means I know that Israel is following him with us.
And also, the previous American policy in the previous administration is with me or against me.
So I don't think they want to imitate neither Israel nor America in this matter.
And then, I mean, if we also adopt their policies, they are also pressured from external sources.
In several issues, M M M let me continue for you.
We also understand and know that there are still pressures coming even to the major countries.
The dress moves you in your politics
We have no movement, our only movement is one thing.
Qatar's internal interest, this is our internal matter.
And any field in which we can help in the Arab world, we will assist in.
What are the sources of power for the Jazeera Channel and Al-Adeem Base?
You could say this is not strong.
Faith in God and our confidence in ourselves
He/She is the vision of His Highness the Prince
I do not want to upset anyone
Let me continue for you, don't worry, I want to make a difference.
And I do not want to compete with anyone
Say whatever they say, whether it’s the greatest Qatar or otherwise
But we have a point of view
First, we expelled the Israeli office; we closed it.
Glory be to Allah, at first they used to say the office is closed, we closed the office, they got upset, and then they went and told the Americans, look at these people.
They lined up with what they call the Devil's team
What do they say?
For the Americans and Europeans, these are not our friends, and we know how to deal with them.
The conspiracies
that you exerted
It means a flaw, we've reached a stage, and in the end, what?
Now I prioritize
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt? One, two points
And based on the fact that Egypt has a significant role in the Arab world
We believe that it is important for you to look into it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew
He needs to leave
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, whether governmental or otherwise, with trivialities
and focusing on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a major state.
In the foreseeable future
Honestly, I think I can't imagine how this situation will turn out.
And I know that a time will come for the mind
And there comes a time for those who are from us.
If I am
Or from them
They are united by great Arab interests
We will find out someday that this matter
It means the world is still going far away.
It means we don't speak in the Egyptian style you have.
If someone extends their hand to us, I will extend my arm by a meter.
Now, Your Excellency Sheikh
It means we've never gotten used to running around.
Only on a solid basis, we are ready to rush to Egypt
Stand with Egypt
There are now many rumors about the harm to Egyptians working in Qatar because of this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs, whether in universities or major companies.
You know, in this matter, first of all, it is not Qatar's way to cancel jobs and cancel.
Because these are people who have nothing to do with what is happening
This is a market where there is a change in demand: one cancels, another comes.
He is a display and a request, and in other nationalities, they decreased, while in others they increased.
Okay, a quick answer.
The office was there
We disturbed the office, so I think we should leave now.
They used to tease us back in the days when they were leading the campaign, saying that all our losses in negotiations with Israel are because of this office.
We closed it; let them resolve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest
And he was among them, and our custom is to host all accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to Akram Kabira Shell.
No, by God, we were not honored before when relations were as they say they are good; we used to honor them. Now it's a bit difficult.
There is no reason now to reopen the office during this period.
The office opens if the reasons are absent
You're the one who raised him.
It means the size of Egypt
Egypt is the one that imposed this.
Our relationship with America is strategic. Let me be clear with you.
In some matters, and this one.
What are the most important things?
In matters in our region, there is treatment of some issues where we disagreed with the previous administration.
Now, we actually have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
A road in moving the peace process is serious in solving the Palestinian issue
All our friends and this is what we deny
What is happening in Iran, what is its impact on the Gulf and on you?
This is a topic the Iranians decide on: how they solve their issues.
among themselves
In their usual ways, and I am sure that they will overcome this crisis.
Iran's establishment, as mentioned by His Highness the Prince
Important for our region, the Gulf area, and we share borders with Iran.
Of course, we have excellent relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because we are a nation that seeks peace and stability for this region
And we would intervene whenever someone on the side wanted to change or modify the Doha agreement.
And I think that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over; the remaining topic is the strategic discussion between the president
Among the Lebanese groups
How to see
Regarding Yemen, do you have a role, or have the Yemenis taken a stance against you?
Look, first of all, we are known for supporting unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab and Gulf country that stood with the Yemeni unity.
And the issue of the south, we have spoken with Yemen, and I was sent twice by His Highness the Prince to meet with the Yemeni President.
I explained to him that our goal is stability in Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I don't want to say anything about what each party did.
But what truly saddened me was
That Qatar, which took this stance, accuses of paying money to the Houthis and to senior officials.
Yemenis because we do not interfere in these affairs
And whoever stands with unity does not stand against it.
And for another purpose, whether for Yemen's benefit politically, economically, or otherwise
This is a topic we have no objection to, but honestly I was shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the days of fighting, His Highness the Prince sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this accusation is strange
The time has ended, but I will briefly say: will these problems that have arisen for you from your efforts to solve issues change your policy regarding intervention in other Arab problems?
By God, if His Highness the Prince hears my words, although I believe there is no need.
And once a large amount was presented to us.
More than five billion dollars at that time, meaning if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion—better than the headache.
I just say it and I believe it because maybe the time in the Arab world now means
What is permitted in this context under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency Sheikh.
And perhaps even the exceptional with the State of Sheikh Hamad
What happened in the agreement in Doha
How did the Doha miracle happen
Entrusting the committee and giving it all support
Regarding Lebanon, after the Israeli invasion that occurred in Lebanon
When there was Arab consensus
And we went to New York; we managed to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we felt this in Doha that both parties were eager.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or to be there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
We understand the reality and know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for many hours.
And I believe it is a shared success
But there was insistence.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is that the regional atmosphere reflects on it directly.
Whether it is peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was destined for this place
That it is so
And unfortunately
External backlash
So I can say the problem among the Lebanese, even if there is an issue, it is not the number one problem.
Doctor Dulat Sheikh, I know maybe it's not the right time now, too early to talk to us about the behind-the-scenes, but
So, what happened? You came here.
You stopped, if I may say so, the ground engagement.
You didn't delay for even a single moment, I mean.
What exactly was happening? I know very well, even the leading Lebanese symbols at that time were telling me what happened.
No, I was from the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
He killed him when we came to Lebanon.
I am proposing this idea with the support and approval of His Highness the Prince.
They are present in it, all the Lebanese leaders.
Because you are here in Beirut, I look out for everyone in their area.
And you are staying in the same hotel and in the same place
And on the same plane, you met and talked.
We created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, we thought about it.
And this was the most important decision I made
Of course, there was.
And this is what I experienced from the Arab University.
We will be honest mediators
And I believe, praise be to Allah, that this has been proven to everyone that Qatar made an effort
On both sides
To reach a satisfactory solution for both parties
And if there is a solution, no one will be a loser
Before you take your step
It was a consultation at the Arab University, and we found support.
What we have done
And I conveyed it to him while we were there
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha.
And he advised me to
Leave them alone and take away their mobiles.
We were able to bring them there, and also the brothers in Syria supported the stance.
And I told you at the beginning, without Arab support, the committee wouldn't have been able to do anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that is happening
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan.
There are several issues surrounding the Arab world.
And everything we extinguished the fire
It is in the interest of the Arab world to prevent external interventions and
And we try as much as possible to be in
sends troops
Even militarily
In such a case, I believe it's a matter.
In the Sheikh State point
He always said to resolve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file.
Actually, Saudi-Syrian
B Qaf Qaf If Saht or Qaf Arab means Qatar and the Arab League
Can what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to review ourselves.
Because of the Arab disagreements
Any agreement between two Arab states
And we have tried this
In the War of Seventy-Three
When the Arabs agree to resolve the issue
I think this is an interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon
The two parties
They tend to dominate wisdom
Arab relations are on the right track
Because we in the Arab world are facing huge and significant challenges
Everyone is playing on our field
And we have no power nor strength.
And how do we stop the play in the Arab countries' arena
At least as Arabs, on the minimum level of agreement
Unfortunately, we are complaining
And we are spectators
Our lack of agreement Arably and the lack of trust between us Arably; trust is absent among Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries
It's not about treason, but rather a kind of...
Al-Jalasi, what is Al-Jalasi called?
This is a matter that requires a pause from everyone, I mean, I think.
Is this wishful thinking? Will you realize it? Will you actually request an Arab summit?
We hurt when he hurts and we rejoice when he rejoices.
I mean, it came with the speech.
Can you play a role in fixing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if only indirectly?
They are keen on finding solutions, and I am sure that with their wisdom.
They may reach an understanding
Among them in many issues
And there was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will...
The relations are improving
It requires both parties to want to take a step forward.
But I can't be sure that this is what's happening right now.
I'm sure that if the Arabs focused on resolving the disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some of the Arab countries I mentioned
A state of optimism and a sense of pride among citizens that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I can't connect what happened in Lebanon
It can be translated as: There is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation on the ground.
There is a possible escalation, perhaps American-Iranian, perhaps other issues, I mean.
Will you still fear her in the coming months?
We as Arabs
We can only request food and medicine delivery.
and electricity for the people
We in Qatar are always ready, Your Highness the Emir.
More than one hundred fifty million Palestinians are besieged
We do not want them to have weapons, nor do we want them to have support, nor do we want anything.
They do all of this.
and Elektro
And God willing, we will give him to the Red Cross organization to deliver to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we only deliver food and medicine to them.
And our disagreement with them continues.
And I hope that the Palestinians on both sides prioritize the national interest.
And they abandon illusions
That means now the Palestinian division is a big wound.
On the solution
And they did not and will not comply
This is a serious issue; they must adhere to the Mecca agreement.
And they should request that even if they go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And they resolve this disagreement
They will not benefit.
What promises from which side
I hope there is a solution, but
Our position on this issue is well known, and it is communicated to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a party and will not accept to be a party in any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her
But the most important thing is that we are a sovereign state, and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but these interests will not harm them or us.
We believe that the Gulf's destiny is to have a clear agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And Iran for cooperation and peaceful coexistence
But when Sheikh's country says that Qatar is not a party
Is there any detail or clarification?
Simply a hint
Not at all
Okay, I would like to return to the Lebanese file, if you please.
Honestly, the Sheikh's country means we were facing a major deadlock, and then in the last hours, we reached a solution.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
Maybe these are scattered pieces of information that have nothing to do with each other, but what happened?
Until you reached this result
What happened in Istanbul, I know if there were specific dates for it before.
Oh, you knew about the negotiations.
Continuously on the topic of the solution in
And there is no doubt that the support of the Kingdom is very important
and changing the negotiation tactics
The discussions led to
To a positive result by bringing together this party from this side and that side
And we started to speak
In this, an Arab and Qatari approach with this paper
Tell me, is there any mistake in this paper?
And we started talking about the substance one after the other
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that remained in the end
But the prince passed by the outskirts
And remove this obstacle
And there was a solution
We heard the word "Emir of Qatar" at the opening session in Doha.
So, do you not consider that your turn is now?
Look, the most important thing is to keep this issue away from the noise.
We have no regional ambition
By God, we don't have control over a country or anything because we are a country.
Our size, we take pride in ourselves, we believe that we can help them solve issues with our other brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important
There are in countries
We want her to do something, and this is very important.
Some small countries are authorized to undertake this role and support them in it.
Some things are excellent, some are good, and some are less than good.
Last question, Sheikh State
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority
A wish to reconcile and mend relationships
What are the Israeli confrontations?
We stopped playing in the Arab arena
We fix our problems in the Arab countries.
I am an active member in Iraq
To guide him to the right path
Regionally and internationally
But if we put our heads together, we can do it.
It means any victory in front of us or we have no hope at all.
Thank you, State of Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this interview.
and the international efforts made to put an end to the ongoing war on Gaza
And we begin with your request for a meeting of the Arab University Council at the level of
Ministerial and as if you have disregarded it
Regarding the request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful First of all, I am happy, Mr. Hassan, to be part of this program.
Even if the circumstances
The humanity that our brothers in Gaza are exposed to
Circumstances require us to do a lot
Qatar has not abandoned the Arab summit
We, in fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Unification is not only from the Security Council's decision but also through other means.
They are not always trampled and underestimated.
And let me put it in another sentence.
And we discipline ourselves
The street can no longer bear it if we, as Arab officials, continue to bear it.
He does not bear / cannot bear
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven written agreements.
Some of them are talking in the meeting, and we could have held the meeting.
We will hold it as much as there is Arab consensus.
And I do not blame those who think that there might not be a meeting; perhaps they have a point.
He/She solved the problem how
Because she is the one who solves it
This is the important topic
Because our goal is not advertising or promotion, our goal is to find
It means you did not turn away from the summit.
And among ourselves, we ask.
We will go so we can pressure the poor other side.
The previous and the subsequent, and the UN Security Council resolution, but let's stay only on the topic of the Arab summit. President Bashar al-Assad
Clearly state that the situation may require holding an Arab summit with those present.
And we found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit.
Who has been banned
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
It means we are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, I mean, if we go to any nation in Asia, Latin America, or elsewhere.
And without a solution
which are classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our view
Are we relinquishing the Palestinian cause?
Because we don't like it
Do we interfere in the Palestinian matter in a way
It means no mother allows entry to who is good and who is bad.
What is Hamas, Hezbollah? I don't know if another party will emerge tomorrow.
Is she a student?
And can we be that we are part of the Arab body?
It means we were planning to get involved in an Arab internal conflict.
Well, shall we go to the Security Council?
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel completes the mission
The second Arab ministerial meeting that you invited to.
which was characterized by debates, disagreements, and intense clashes
He is at an important point
It's not this that matters.
That if we have a meeting
From the crossings
There is no longer any issue of peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because at the end, he tells you no, we have to wait.
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative.
And froze the peace negotiations with Israel
We say that we are on one side, and they say that we are losing in this matter.
There is a bigger loss than the one we are currently experiencing. Well, we are always respectful, polite, and committed to the decisions since the ceasefire days.
Saa'da Sheikh says that the disagreements are not important
There were those who wished to see Hamas and others like it destroyed.
This is more of a political stance than a quarrel between one minister and another, or the like.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that occurred.
But not everyone
We do not want to speak on behalf of others.
It is very important that we become men ourselves, men of our countries.
We are the ones who implement our countries' policies
The one acting on her behalf with such things
I think, I mean
I don't think they respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone acting on behalf of the West?
No, God willing, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council decision
What will be his agenda?
The position became clear in the Arab effort.
And here is the disagreement if Israel implements the decision immediately
We can say in a decision.
But Israel did not implement this decision
Now, are we ready to go and request Chapter Seven in? I know, of course, that there is difficulty.
Do not question who has been questioned by the international community before, and if questioned
In hesitation
Al Al Al Watha
They believe that they have done right by the Jews or the Israelis.
They will take their right.
This current Arab situation
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council
And they agree on a summit and make difficult decisions
And the Western countries will seek us.
Because we are deep in Arab culture, in a world and among people, and you see how the Arab street is moving on this issue.
But this decision is important
The issue of summoning our leaders one after the other
So okay, in the end they said, "By God, it turned out there was nothing, and it was all false."
Okay, if now we are like Germany or others, are we demanding?
They don't need to pay compensation for the attack they carried out, I mean, you are providing false information.
and kill hundreds of thousands
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We, as Arabs, are somewhat divided.
He is striving in how to do it.
Removing the issue
Batriġa and it was finally over and done.
If the Arab nation said, "If you send forces to Darfur," we would send forces to Darfur.
The Arabs considered or some considered the decision of 1868
And the group exerted effort in issuing the decision
The one issued by the Security Council
I don't want to say that it is a victory or not a victory.
Things will turn out as they should
Let's assume that victory
What are we going to do?
It is assumed that we, the rest, do not commit to the decision.
But I assure you, we will adhere to the decision.
Unfortunately, you will adhere to it, but you are not supposed to adhere to the decision.
Even if, after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted.
It means we
Will you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think that the Arab nation
In the current situation, ready for any alternative
And I do not think the Arab nation is ready
In the implementation of the Gaza siege
for other political purposes
To favor one group over another in Palestine instead of fixing who is among them.
We started trying to plan
Once they held a gathering, I don't know if it was my Arab-European intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And once they did, meaning we are participating.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West
But that we go
I mean, I want there to be sorting in this.
I am, of course, not talking about the decision, I am talking about
The repercussions are because this issue started two years ago, the Gaza issue is not recent.
I will talk about the subject from two years ago, but specifically about the decision.
Do you have any reservations about its provisions?
Head and not executed
We are not invited
Maybe they think we have a different point of view
It was required that everyone share the same point of view.
It's not necessary for all of us to have the same point of view, but I believe that those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for it.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza for the past two years, I said that some parties
Favoring one group over another that participated in the topic of the blockade on Gaza
Indeed, you agree with the statements, hints, or accusations that have been made here and there.
A genuine Arab collusion in everything happening now in Gaza
So we are aware of the part.
It's about something, let me tell you, and we're not aware of everything.
But I know
The Palestinian-Palestinian disagreement
An Arab and international incitement
And he did not harm if he did not ignite; it was their concern that differed, this disagreement.
And it was after the elections that took place
There is enthusiasm for authority
Majority
It is assumed that if we give them a chance and see
Are they still the same people who are revolutionary in the sense of revolution, meaning they only know the rifle and fighting?
But on the day they came
Arably, some of our brothers believe that these radical movements should not come to power.
Now they say among themselves that there is an attack
Hamas previously broke the truce, or the Palestinians from Gaza broke the truce.
The ceasefire
The web remains, and the Palestinian people in Gaza are still hungry after two years.
This is okay.
For Israeli security reasons
Clear OK, I don't want them. This ruling doesn't concern me; I am in Qatar.
But what is the sin of the remaining people
What and then who will decide
That these or those, not every country has sovereignty in choosing.
My government
He is the root of the problem
But I'm sure he could have been treated.
If we strive, we strive to deepen the disagreement.
But it is clear that if it is required of us to overpower one group over another because this group
A group we consider terrorist or what we consider it to be
What has happened, all of this has led to
And also, even the promises they make to the party they will live with are appropriate.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts made to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
On those Egyptian efforts
No, it's not wrapping.
It requires an important role
And also, Egypt's borders are adjacent to the borders of Israel and the borders of Palestine.
that we
And now I think we should stop the chaos
In Gaza, we need people who can stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace
There must be
And so we always ask her for a bigger role.
What was announced about it
It means that the initiative cannot be evaluated now.
Or to give the opportunity for success or studying.
I think there is a chance of success.
If the brothers in Egypt can
They bring Palestinian perspectives closer together
And the one discussing the initiative assumes that the affected party is in Gaza
Because he is the one who can say yes and can say no
And this is an important point
When the decision was issued, it was 1,886.
We have a problem with a Palestinian car
We don't want to hear from either side.
But I wish that when the Palestinian delegation went
And when they went to the university, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
So they can now show the Israelis that this is our brother, we are with him as one.
This is an important point
Let's not make the authority
It is our goal to protect and build our policy.
On staying in power
Sheikh Al-An
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its terms, but
Do you think, in principle, that it is suitable to be a mechanism for implementing the international resolution one thousand and sixty-six, as some have stated?
Balanced circle
Now not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because
Every day passes
In our brothers' blood, there is a spilling.
We do not want the Israelis to extend this issue; once they finish their mission, we will start presenting this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are keen on it.
And I want to clarify this, everything I say
Now I need to solve the issue.
And not like what Israel wants
This Turkish role has been evident since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it mean an expression?
About an Arab vacancy
And there was no doubt that the stance was remarkable
And she has an Arab depth
Its entry indicates an Arab deficit, an Arab deficit.
We know that there is an Arab deficit
Part of it due to disagreements
Part of it is due to each person's opinions; I believe that my opinion is the best.
And so-and-so believes that his opinion is better
And not in conscience, how do we make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision
And they do not dominate us one by one
One says no, sorry, I'll give them two or three extra days to discipline them, bring the team to their level, and resolve the issue.
We must rise above this and not accept this.
Hamas might have mistakes; we are the ones who are accountable to Hamas.
Arably Arably
But now
At least tell them no
In the context of the situation, Qatar is also required to agree, as we hear. We will return to this point later.
On the ground also, at the same time, you heard.
Khaled Meshaal yesterday, the head of the political bureau of Hamas
First of all, it's not necessary every time Brother Khaled Meshaal speaks, with my respect and appreciation for him
Why don't we sit with Khaled Meshaal and talk to him as Arabs?
I will deliver it to the Arab University and tell him.
This is important talk
From Hamas
Impose Israel's conditions also impose conditions
Let them impose conditions, meaning they are not allowed to impose conditions, and Israel can impose conditions.
First, what is your opinion of this Arab popular gift?
Either these are rabble or these are crowds; we shouldn't listen to their words. Sometimes they tell me to shut up, I haven't heard their words.
Diqoul completely differs; first, he liberated his country.
With allies and non-allies, he liberated his country from Nazi occupation
Now we are the ones talking about it
The Arab gift, we suppose
Presidents are supposed to represent the opinions of their peoples
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed
It can be fulfilled from these demanding rows.
Also, many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation are demanding
Regarding what is happening, the office and the embassy are still open.
They are speaking with the same logic.
We will cut ties; we are moving forward with all Arab countries.
To cut off the relationship, all relationships, even if someone says they have a treaty with him
Ereydon Qatar, I only sacrifice
that we
And this is more important than the relationship
Not only in this decision, but also in this one and in tougher decisions.
From this decision
It means that we must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells anyone anything because they want to gain moral or material benefits or to claim.
Yes, I mean before we close this file, in this topic also, there are countries that have taken individual steps.
Good Chavez, his topic is different. Chavez has a disagreement with America.
Our peoples do not need us to summon them.
The five permanent ambassadors of the Great Assembly, and I present these arguments; these are films.
We have finished with it; the street is now smarter than that.
With the highest ceiling, His Excellency the Sheikh
He is calling on resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter is discussed within a single Arab framework, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that respects us through which people will respect us
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
And we are not motivated
How will we bring Syria and Lebanon and other countries, and there are Arab countries that do not speak with each other.
It shouldn't be there
A qualitative shift in Arab relations
So this is the current policy among Arab countries.
List, but I think his validity has expired.
In the goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese composition is
Lebanon, no doubt that
She gave an example that if I returned, I would satisfy her.
The situation in Gaza is different; the situation in Gaza is still ongoing.
Surrounded from all sides
And this siege
Gives a different nature
Yes, I mean here the objectives regarding Israel, meaning the goals of the operation concerning Israel.
A day you hit someone, a day you punish someone, a day like this, a day you please so-and-so
And therefore, the example of what happened in Lebanon is not a good example for them.
The solution model that was achieved in Lebanon
He considers him to be good.
To Gaza
Look, the problem in Gaza or the Palestinians is easier to solve than the solution in Lebanon.
Different in whether we return to our land today or tomorrow.
Their disagreements over power
On the distribution of power
And this differs because their fabric is closer to Baa'dh.
From the fabric of thought in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is easier
And here is the problem
Saa'da Al-Sheikh
It means we only have a few minutes left; if we summarized this topic, where could we go?
And a diplomat means
How can this process end?
For the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
or he refuses
And we help
Those who didn't go with us
Becoming a failure is ours, Arab.
From a strategic perspective
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we did not see a comprehensive initiative.
Neither before nor now, why
It's not an initiative issue; it's more about how we feel.
The one who solves the issue, we help without mentioning Qatar's name because some people might be sensitive to the name Qatar.
And our goal is not to reach the summit because we have the summit scheduled in March.
If we take the initiative, will we be better than our brothers? I don't think so.
And we do not pressure them.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
So we are moving forward with this initiative, we saw all parties involved, there was a meeting on Wednesday, but it was postponed due to going to the Security Council.
We hope that, God willing, we will make progress. We wish our Arab brothers would help us as much as possible with this matter.
We hope to keep him away from the competition topic.
Arabic Arabic
In her agitation due to a dispute with the Sudanese government at one point.
And this is also one of our problems, I mean, okay, we fight, we disagree, we differ.
I don't want to get involved in this matter.
In Kuwait on the nineteenth of this month, I believe, of course, the Arab situation as
As you know and as you mentioned and explained in detail, your time.
Is the Arab climate all supportive? She is the first economic summit.
His Highness
And of course, whenever there is any summit involving any Arab brother, we always attend.
And we always prevent attending any summit.
But does he not fear that it will turn into a political summit?
Of course, considering that time imposes itself
It's too late, even if it means after ten days.
We are talking about Palestinians after they have gone twenty-five days without eating, exhausted.
It means it is
Isn't it said that the Arabs could not unite?
This is what we said.
This is what we said
With all due respect, this summit is programmed and we are committed to it.
I think that we
The Arab street is upon us
Our way of doing things that we are following
And therefore, I mean
And we submit
And he says, "That's it, this is a summary."
On this meeting
Thank you, viewers, for your follow-up.
And goodbye. The coverage continues of the ongoing war on Gaza. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributing to the preparation of the draft private law
He also served on the memberships of many local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have also delivered more than seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and published articles in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently used.
Are you referring to people with disabilities—people with special needs—or, as I said, people with disabilities?
Now, first of all, good evening
Because people with disabilities have taken the legal rights approach or the human rights culture
Because she treated people with disabilities as individuals first.
Human
And then his disability resulted from his attempt to adapt to society.
Then the medical concept was dominance
Then I directed the concept towards the idea
The emergence of special education and private education in
This category has become
And we started calling them people with special needs
And they are the normative rules from which they are derived
The role of the Special Rapporteur on monitoring the implementation of this document
Then the pace quickened until the international convention appeared, which was legally binding and distinguished itself from the rules in this regard.
And I established a fundamental condition or a basic rule for this term
who deals with these people as if they are humans, as if they are people, as if they are persons
With the change of terminology as you suggested, is there a change in the perception of this segment of society?
Yes, and it is measured accordingly
Different from one region to another
But the special thing about this topic
The Arab world distinguished itself or differed.
However, the legal aspect is present, and a culture of human rights exists there, for example in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are perhaps due to a lack of financial resources, not so.
Of course, what I wanted to say is that the culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources, and sometimes it is a lack of political will.
Sometimes the legislation, but
But unfortunately, awareness is low and also human rights culture is absent.
Ten percent of the world's population has disabilities
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age
And they suffer from unemployment
It means through my visit to Darfur
He, despite the mines and the weapons
For males, it is better to a lesser degree.
My disabled colleagues are in remote areas in distant regions.
Therefore, there are many trends among organizations working in this field that try to elevate
Awareness that achieving the right in education
Instead of establishing many religious centers, if I may say so.
She is heading towards establishing training centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things that, thank God, through our work in the office
I tried with the organizations present in the State of Qatar
Action agenda plan
You organize the work agendas for these humanitarian organizations so that they include those centers.
In light of the decline in the current situation of people with disabilities around the world
I cannot call it or agree with you that there is a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region because of the disability issue
Placed within the societal context, within the political context, and the economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of persons with disabilities to be...
And they are among the marginalized groups
In a country like the one I mentioned, like Gaza Strip, like Darfur
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely make her believe that there is no improvement in the situation.
And for now, I translated it on the ground, for example, if I can give an example.
Like the Qatari Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects will proceed
For persons with disabilities related to health aspects within that strategy, and there are other projects.
We also tried to insert it.
Within the work of organizations based on the land
My mother now means Kamal Karo from Syria. Welcome, Kamal.
Good evening, Suleiman Qaru
Sulaiman Krou, excuse me, please Sulaiman
Best regards to you and to the honorable Mrs. Hafsa
First, is there a mental disability included in the United Nations laws?
Intellectual disability means a healthy person who, as a result of pressure, did not experience pressure and did not suffer from intellectual disability.
He caused a disability as a result of torturing and imprisoning him, which led to a mental disability that he has been treating for six years.
I know about four hundred people, between children and mentally disabled adults, resulting from prisons.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Honestly, I mean me
Faham means knowing, knowing, knowing as they know their children
And everyone means intention, meaning intention without, without, without, without making themselves their names.
And there are values in the West
Agreed upon, but people
Whoever understands from people who have reverted or have been defeated in Islam, their wisdom is not to be taken.
Thank you very much, Naif Al-Saeed, for informing us from Kuwait.
I return to our guest to comment on what was mentioned in
Communications: Suleiman asked if there is a mental disability
Yes, within the classification
The World Disability Organization, certainly intellectual and mental disability as it is called
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or auditory, and motor disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, disability is
Action and reaction occur within a specific social context
In the Arab world or in other regions
It is certain that addressing disability has taken a long stage.
And even at the level of the United Nations
There, for example, during my experience and work as a private coordinator, one of the things I was trying to address and work on.
In the sense of truth for everyone
Until He prepares for them
Different qualifications to ensure their admission to schools; also, work is organized by the labor organization.
Works on vocational rehabilitation that includes persons with disabilities
I entered upon him with some improvements
Especially after the reform
In general, it is present in this international organization.
I also mean as a special course.
My practical truth, and this was positive for me even if not directly related
and those who supported this position
I saw him in many meetings, for example, the International Convention.
For the rights of persons with disabilities
It means she was hindered by these restrictions or these shortcomings.
For example, regarding legal capacity
And this is one of the fundamental points in the world of disability that no
Unfortunately, the United Nations delayed some things during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, I will end with this.
The world: governments and non-governmental organizations; member states of the United Nations
We sent another survey
For the United Nations organizations and their agencies in the different regions
We want to know to what extent disability programs are on their agendas.
If she sets budgets, then there is participation of people with disabilities.
Human Rights
It is not just development issues.
Okay, we are now receiving more calls. Moshri Naji from Algeria, please go ahead, Naji.
And peace be upon you.
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria, from and exactly where.
I just wanted to ask, I am actually physically disabled.
Okay, we will direct this question to her. Naji Mashri, you told us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Al-Halabi from Greece, please, Ahmed
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing until I take them on seasonal trips, and this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially since they might cause harm to others or to themselves
Everything we are discussing is within the realm of unproductive debate, thank you.
Miss Hessa mentioned the financial shortfall.
Especially in poor countries, in Africa and Latin America, and I am calling for them.
Establishment of the International Disability Support Fund and allocation of one percent of the net profit of each institution worldwide
And that shall be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
A hundred failures and many disabled people, war victims, and so on.
Thank you very much, Ab Ibrahim Abdullah, for talking to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri questions and reviews his problem: he is disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning through Algeria
The needs within the local community must be met within this community.
They are the same rights that should be granted to any other person.
In the meaning of truth, in life first, then in housing, in health, and in education.
Therefore, I truly call from this platform for governments and Arab governments in particular.
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are already included in the existing agendas.
No, there is no need, I mean, to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or not necessary if it is this country
She can do it, and she must be committed to performing it.
So I first advise him to return and go back to the responsible authorities at the government level if possible.
Because it is within the national scope, and it must be carried out within this scope.
Your mention of the International Convention for Persons with Disabilities: many countries have signed it, but they do not adhere to it.
And here we pose the question of one of the callers who asked why there are no laws.
It is definitely true that we live in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and many correct actions.
Certainly, many agreements and certainly many covenants do not have literal commitments in them.
And an exemplary commitment of many countries, such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and infringements, and we are aware of that.
But the issue is that we adopt an agreement and organize ourselves around it
First, we will ensure at least that there is awareness.
And this awareness begins from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers.
and the officials, then gradually extending until reaching the entire society
The issue also is our commitment to prepare reports, and these reports are sent to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge and understanding and the rise of the level of awareness and...
For the reports, you worked as a rapporteur at the United Nations, right?
Yes, from what I saw and recorded there, there is interest.
Therefore, I believe there is a relative advantage of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and invite.
It also means that it is important for persons with disabilities.
And we will hear what Ali Abid Al-Sanari, the head of the Qatar Association for the Deaf, has to say to us.
The mute speaks about him. Sayyed Naji, we are honored. Welcome, Sayyed Naji and Sayyed Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you.
With Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Deaf Center
which is led by Her Excellency Sheikha Hessa
Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for the United Nations (formerly)
Kasim from the State of Qatar
And the Chairman of the Board, the truth of the matter is that Sheikha Hessa had extensive experience.
And the international agreement you are talking about now is, in fact, the truth.
It is a great benefit for all people with special needs around the world.
and especially in the Arab world
And I, and I wish as Asim
That these countries implement this international agreement
which serve people with special needs and it is essential that
For now, there should be someone to activate this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, the head of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
We stop at
Here we go, and we continue our talk, but after a short break. Stay with us.
Send and share your opinions on important issues such as political, sports, economic, and other diverse topics.
MS Messenger Service via Al Jazeera Direct
Dear viewers, welcome back, and our guest for today's episode is Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability International Fund for Support
Disability and it is mandatory for all countries to provide funds. What is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Cases Fund.
And unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
The monitoring task for applying the normative rules
When I worked these six years, there was no support worth mentioning.
Except for China and Austria
And I always mean, I thank this country for this support.
The main supporting country is my country Qatar
which established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, الحمدلله
Yes, this lack of support indicates what
It means like what we discussed at the beginning, and this point is always raised by saying
With the ordinary people's situation
And it is called how we care for disabled people or caring for the disabled
It means that there is a real, genuine, and serious commitment.
Al (God) in all His states, in all categories
People with disabilities, children, adolescents, displaced persons, refugees
All of these, we will really have reached a degree of what is called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And there are those voices that always demand, never tire, and never give up.
In the Islamic region and the Arab region, why isn't a part allocated? Sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
As I presented the truth, and I thank him from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the budget allocated by
The non-compliance you mentioned regarding the payment of financial dues and
Funds to assist people with disabilities: does this only include developing countries and Arab countries, or not?
Even developed countries do not offer
It means the one before me, who is Swedish, yes.
Also some countries of the European Union
And surely, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that perhaps were not.
You even know about the existence of this special rapporteur.
In my case, I mean what happened
It was Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, also had many promises, but unfortunately, there was only one country.
We will talk about the Arab region but
More contacts mean more connections. Hamad Al Marri from Qatar, please go ahead, Hamad.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you
Hello, Dr. Marhaban, Sheikhah Hessa
Almost ten years
This girl, now we notice that if she is caught, she has a psychological disability.
So what is your role, I mean, regarding a girl like this who is suffering?
She is with her colleagues
With me, sometimes even if we stay
So, what is your role regarding Qatari girls children?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al Marri, for talking to us from Qatar. Kuroan Bahjat from Kuwait, welcome.
As they say, Oh Sheikh Hissa
Why don't we leave our oil in its place?
People with special needs in the Arab world can be counted.
And we can help them
We have enormous financial capabilities
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
Reviving the individual's morale

This is if we are truly believers
Thanks and appreciation to Sheikha Hessa for her efforts and what she accomplished during her tenure as Special Rapporteur
With our thanks and appreciation to her, and thanks to the State of Qatar for all that it has done for those with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed, for talking to us from Qatar.
Hello, Professor Wasila
And peace be upon you.
And on your honorable position
Happiness of Sheikha Hessa
My question is about prevention
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
And the genetic level may be a result, perhaps, of shortcomings by the families, which is marriage to relatives.
I think this is a large percentage.
Leads to disability
Thank you very much, flag bearer Sharif. You spoke to us from Tunisia, and I return to you, our guest.
First connected, Hamad Al-Mari inquired about
Where is he heading with a girl with a disability, a psychological disability?
And he wonders where it is heading
In every country
Certainly, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether intellectual disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
Regarding this for the schools
There was previously
Mother, I mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which has now become the Supreme Council.
Brigadier General Sherif from Tunisia pointed out a very important point.
and scientific papers and others
Some programs are for organizations working with disabilities only, but even within the campaigns that
Programs for women
All of these directed many campaigns and reproductive health programs until now.
I talked about this aspect
Adopts healthy strategies
You are raising awareness
The risks of marrying relatives
and genetic factors
And I believe in a state of Qatar
And with customs and traditions, but it takes a certain amount of time.
Especially in tribal communities
But over time, there is a response to it, but it is necessary that there be a legal obligation, meaning
Yes, Kuroan Bahjat asked and suggested that one percent of the budget of the Arab countries be allocated.
For helping people with disabilities, leave me at first.
Yes, there is the statistical estimate that the World Health Organization applied to the entire world.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women
But these numbers are doubling
There is a study in South Africa that observed and proved.
It is certain that the statistics that appeared about the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza
Every dead person was met by three disabled individuals
And since our Arab region has become an undisputed zone of conflicts
Even the suggestion made by Bahjat Krouan
It means one percent won't be enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region, if
This issue of lineage is related to disabled individuals or other marginalized groups.
Honestly, I truly don't think they agree.
which involves addressing their problems and needs
They confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
The procedures carried out by governments generally do not count disabled people.
Yes, this is also related to the society's culture and sometimes to restrictions.
The community-based meaning when a population census is conducted by
The relevant devices
About having a disabled person at home
There was only one question asking whether there is a disabled person or not.
The section concerned with this issue and through the relevant parties there
Let's collaborate on preparing the form
We recommended that there be more details.
First, clarify whether this person's disability type is male or female if they are present.
Does his assistant intervene or not?
The truth is, even the number, as I understood correctly, why haven't we reached the precise result?
That the interest is also in the progress of Fatima Al-Dosari with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
And peace be upon you
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with disabilities.
And I extend my thanks to the ruler of the country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Lady Mosa, for her support of this group.
Indeed, I am proud, proud of the care and attention I receive.
On her important role
Latifa Al-Musaifari, please go ahead
Because they represent a significant disability in society without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Masifiri from Qatar, with us Nassim.
Abdulkarim from Jordan, please Nasim
Please, Karim, we are listening to you
And peace be upon you
Thank you for your efforts. Honestly, I have a comment.
First of all, I am an audiologist and I worked in Qatar for approximately four years.
And we had a month of awareness about hearing and speech problems.
We used to hold conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I have been residing in Jordan for about three years.
Honestly, it offers new and wonderful services.
Honestly, it offers new services, whether in terms of material, non-material, or moral aspects.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, I mean, in the sources
That which is affiliated with the Ministry of Education in government schools
We, as private institutions, also
We receive wonderful and beautiful support
Okay Karim, do you have a direct question? Sorry for the short notice.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan offers wonderful services, and in my opinion, they are very excellent.
Commentary on what was mentioned in the viewers' communications

Regarding the topic
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.

Because it is based on a rights issue for these individuals regardless
And honestly, what is it

And now you wish for it to come true
Of course, I wish for both.
I hope that this research or survey will serve as a basis, and that more qualitative studies will be conducted in this field.
Also, explain to me from this experience.
She has six years of experience.
and coordination among Arab countries as well
They also have a role; it's not just a matter of rights, they are recipients of rights.
Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on Disability, thank you.
We welcome the elegant presenter on the Al-Dawri and Al-Kass channel, Lana Lana. Good morning.
I am also pleased to welcome the talented captain of Al-Masral Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello and welcome, Ali
Welcome to you
Good morning
I will leave you the space to congratulate; everyone can congratulate at their convenience because I am busy.
I had an open studio for five hours, and before that, I had two hours before the day.
Congratulations to the State of Qatar, its land, government, and people. They truly deserve this global achievement.
I got this opportunity to be here and congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He is the Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, because you are from the sports field and those working in this area and knowledgeable about these lines and this field extensively.
Because even we
And the competition means we deserve it when we got six votes, and between us and America, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for America.
Not at night because our file is rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors. Supported a lot, let's fill the stadiums.
It means that some people were afraid that there might be something like America.
And perhaps there are some countries where these matters are already ready, so there is no need to prepare stadiums or other projects related to this event.
Now my brothers are ready
They were just afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you are a sportsman. I believe this is a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect he will enter the realm of politics, economics, and health.
Only the Cypriots
What does this achievement mean now?
Of course, a great achievement, especially for us athletes. Even non-athletes saw their happiness, look at how.
God willing, Ali told me this at the moment of the announcement.
By God, I was coming out of the workout and we were listening on the radio.
We used to wait for him, and I had one of the friends with me.
And we're in the car, listening to the radio.
As soon as they announced Qatar and Yemen
We all shouted, the two of us, and of course, the hole is closed.
My friend got out of the hole.
Screaming and everyone is just watching, our work is dangerous and we're heading out.
We organized a march from the beginning
Thank God, it was a very special day I think, and all the channels probably focused more on this event.
Lana, you are definitely involved in this matter.
And especially the private sports channels
How did they celebrate this topic and what was their reaction?
There were media outlets from many channels around the world.
The main teacher has become really clear on the map, Qatar is well known.
Certainly, also, the presence of the player in the national team is very important.
And I expect that this is a responsibility heavily upon him.
What do you think about this specific point?
Okay, Captain Ali, what are the specifications that this player must possess to join this national team?
Now on several sports occasions coming your way
And now, we need to count a strong generation.
It means he has basic rules and mathematical techniques in football in a studied manner.
What are the rules that must be met and the essentials that must be available in this player?
I believe that professionalism guarantees everything.
Diligence in exercises, consistency in exercises, discipline
These are all basic things to help the player put everything he has into the matches or training.
I think each stage has its own meaning, so don't say it has a special character.
She has such nuances and feelings.
From various programs, from entertainment to sports, which one do you find the most beautiful? Which one made you feel the most?
By God, it's beautiful
It really helps you take care of yourself, knowing how I want to stay healthy through sports—that's the most important thing.
Then you have football, the beloved sport of the fans, followed by everyone whether you like it or not. When you step into the field, you need to love it.
What confines the media person to one side for us
What confines you like this, it puts you in a certain side.
Tough, but only with a football.
Neither sports nor medicine, sports are not nice.
Ali also means there are some important things we want to talk about.
I didn't want you to come back like this, being ten years younger to reach 2022.
I never wished for this thing.
Of course, we all definitely wish for that, especially since the World Cup is coming up. I mean, now any player...
It means that if only one person watches the World Cup match, he will be happy and excited, so it means that he is playing in the World Cup.
And I hope they will meet expectations, God willing, and this is their opportunity, God willing.
What is the word you want to say from a professional player? What is the word you want to say from your heart to them?
This period, and we wanted you to be with us.
Honestly, just like the one currently, I mean, it's just a break.
He returned to the championships after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup tournament.
You must have a beautiful signature from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
Mashallah, I mean, Qatar TV has now become like a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our chosen candidate is a strong choice, God willing, he will win many different awards.
Let's talk about his work with Al Ittihad Club.
How are you there? How are you? Hopefully, you're doing well.
Sure, thank God honestly, Umm Asalal
Yesterday, of course, he was with us in the studio. We talked a lot about the players.
So I expect that some of the young people who are watching us still feel that you are one of them.
Maltoob
It means a natural image in the professional league and player transfers.
I believe I got my chance in Am Asalal regarding a presentation or a presentation.
I am grateful that I was able to take a place in the Asian Cup with the team, thank God.
And my condition is good, thank God, with the team.
The topic of sports: how can we make it social?
And how can Qatar introduce sports among women, children, and youth?
It connects everything together, meaning everything complements sports.
You even have in various fields of sports, women are not involved.
Now we have a sports awareness among every individual, from the young to the old, in this community.
About ten years, roughly, until we reach or twelve years until we reach this occasion. I think it's enough time.
Because we have the new generations constantly looking for the way.
A generation is passing by and growing up, but there is a next generation that needs to be raised from a young age with sports awareness.
We have Aspire, Aspire is a great edifice, something we cannot deny. A large edifice, founded by the founder.
Actual and number one for the new sports generation
All we have to do is set our intention and move forward.
And they love football in particular
How do I attract the audience so they can communicate directly with each other, I mean, with all the different matches, even between clubs?
Honestly, the main problem we have in the Qatari league is the lack of fans.
But we have this problem of attendance; I mean, the Qatari Union still hasn't found a solution to attract the fans.
What is the method we should use to attract them to follow these matches?
It depends on the person himself; some of them don't like to attend the stadium.
Media plays a major role in the idea of public apathy
And now they have implemented a ticket system or a points collection system, a points collection system.
No, the union has a plan with several steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have methods like Al Rayyan to attract fans. Of course, Al Rayyan is wealthy, so it doesn't need fans.
Some clubs need some club management to organize activities and hold events.
The public's right to motivation. I believe these are the means we have.
The players mean the new generation
Their love for work, their belief in their abilities, and just like that, not only material support but also moral support is very beneficial.
We definitely, I mean, thank you for this good meeting, Mashallah.
So we wanted to take your last words on the occasion of this wonderful victory, of course, Qatar's victory in the 2022 World Cup. Please, go ahead.
We always get upset that Qatar didn't insist; on the contrary, they fulfilled and exceeded expectations, always promising and delivering as promised.
With God's permission, Captain Ali, I would like to deliver the final words I wish to convey in this meeting.
And I tell them congratulations, and God willing, forward, God willing.
Thank you, Captain and player, and we wish you all the best, God willing, in your sports career and also in your life. May God grant you success, Lord.
And let us love sports more and more
The topic of the episode is young talents
Some young people think that these songs are just a current trend, but they actually have a very deep and extensive history.
A group of young people singing Arabic words or English words
Today we will follow this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
And we will get to know them better through our meeting that will bring us together with them live on air.
Welcome, viewers, wherever you are.
Years ago, a new type of singing spread in the Arab and Gulf arena.
Coming from the West and specifically from America, it's rap music.
And before delving into the topic of rap singing
There is a tendency to use any word without any hesitation.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding writing the lyrics of the song
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are very important, and we will learn about them through two people who are strongly involved in this field.
They made a nice team
I welcome Youssef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah Youssef. Good morning.
Hello and welcome, Salman. Good morning.
Good morning, hello
I am very happy to have you with us through this program, of course.
And also, of course, through the subject of rap singing.
What’s your business in this, Youssef?
We saw that rap art was not really present in Tar.
Patriarch is sweeter
In the citizen's language
Among them, there is the musical, the sad, and the one that deals with political topics.
Yes, I know that rap
And these songs, I think, are an art form, like visual art painting a picture, the poet writing a poem
The singer can sing, the musician can play on any instrument.
You can feel the acceptance from Qatari society, from the Gulf society, for this type of music.
2010
You feel that people have started to like collecting CDs of rap songs.
Various ages
And there are families, I mean, many people have started to hear more than before.
There was a website like that.
And how many of you are in this squad so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry, and deliver it in a rap style.
The rapper, I swear, just as you say, you can say that he is the one singing himself.
He is the one who sometimes plays music and the one who composes the lyrics.
Oh okay
Listen to him, I swear I recorded this song.
Okay, now all these songs you produced are from Salman, Mink, Youssef, or anyone else from the same band.
Did you think she would be present in a specific CID to be sold in the markets?
But you know that when I am a personality, it means I will go make an album and put it on the market, so this is difficult—commercial registration and procedures, I mean.
Well, why didn't you think about it? You are five and twenty, so a single hand can't clap.
You have five and twenty hands, God bless you all, as youth and brothers.
You can promote this CD through multiple websites on the internet.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, and also through local newspapers.
There are thirteen songs, I think.
Registration is not at the same time now
Just a little bit, but it was clear.
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not the same as now, just clear.
And it is approximately fifty CDs.
It means I can't say there's none because maybe some young people have known this art for ten years.
Not with the registration, and I expect the distribution during this period is now different.
And especially because there is a large collection of music, a large collection of types of techno music now.
Are these guys or these artists who produce a large collection of beautiful songs?
We also want to talk about the parties you participated in.
By God, look at the party that was in Doha. We participated in only one party.
Of course, it was organized for us by Al Sadd Club, so they weren't with us.
Start engaging the audience
Let's see, something we didn't expect the number to be this high.
And what surprised us was that the families are more.
Families more than youth
From to and organization means awesome
We were a bit nervous, I mean, it was the first time in Doha.
It means we didn't expect any turnout.
But the audience interaction was amazing
And it was a long time of benefits from songs, I mean.
Okay, let's hear something or some lyrics from one of the songs they composed, for example, and performed in front of the audience, and it was well received by the youth in particular.
For example, let's hear some words so that we can also show them to the viewers.
And we can hear it in the air
Please, take your time.
Hello, سالم
The problem is that I kind of misspoke.
Let's hear it.
My mother
We now have the Morning Doha program with us.
The one who comes in the morning, I feel his mood is open.
Salman, like a mountain, has been in rap for five years.
Even if one doesn't accept, he can still be considered poor.
I brought a lot of people in their mood.
I need to tweak some words.
Okay, the songs you sang, for example, give me a sentence from one of the sentences you said, for example.
His view is that not all songs are random; I mean, what he just said is that they call it "Freestyle" in English.
It means on the same weight
But when I sing a song, I mean I carefully think about the lyrics I compose.
Thank you, let's keep following it.
I think I can say good morning, my country. Good morning, Qatar, with the Sabah Al Doha program.
Stay active and present, going directly to the air for the viewers.
They see one by one, they look at each other, showcasing a bit of art.
With us, the Morning of Doha program
Of course, the beautiful song you saw
I'm sitting here now bothering the guys more than being present on the internet and everywhere.
He really greets you when you recorded it.
She was a participant.
Each of us has what belongs to us; everyone has the right to themselves.
I feel that Yusuf can't really accept my words, either he takes them or he can't dismiss them.
Everyone takes words.
We definitely, I mean, I expect that every artist, every painter, and every poet always...
It is also possible to write about love for sports.
In love with the homeland itself
They definitely participated in the National Day through the march.
Through beautiful songs, because you are Qatari youth, you also represent Qatar.
Doha is decorated to welcome the Asian Cup, and there is a large parade along the Corniche.
To welcome this event
And we are sharing with you these clips for the reception, of course
Doha hosts the Asian Cup
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these clips together live on air.
To entertain only with the same WhatsApp presence and the presence of these crowds, our children students, I mean
And I arrived early this morning at Doha Airport for the Asian Cup to continue
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's go back once again to our guests Yusuf and Salman who are lighting up the studio.
The fear of division among the Gulf Arab rap groups, Qatari rap, is correct.
I can say about you like this
By God, I mean, we are currently, I mean
We will organize a party, but not for sure.
But right now, you're working on a specific party, and I will announce it, God willing. يوسف
God willing, but I mean it's not certain yet, I am still at the beginning of the journey.
The beginning of the journey, we wish you all the best and I am sure that our program, God willing, will be your support, God willing, with all our hearts.
Also, where do Salman and all of you young people, twenty-five of you, gather?
Where is the meeting item, and how do you put the ideas, how do you write them together?
There definitely needs to be some shared songs.
It's not necessary for, for example, one person like Salman or Youssef or any of them to sing a full song.
There must be some harmony between you. Where do you meet? When do you meet?
By God, look, twenty-five people, it's hard to gather them all at once.
So I start talking to Youssef and to Aflan and to them because today we might gather somewhere.
To understand the idea of the song and the lyrics
And he also in a second way afterward
I record what is on me
He is deaf and he is completing it.
This will be for you, Yusuf will record, and I will send it to you shortly.
You see the experiences that are available outside.
You mean you acquire some CDs of major artists.
You gain some experience, I mean, you learn some techniques from them.
This is definitely us, always, I mean.
The artists who have been in this field for years or who have experience and standing in this field
One hears them, their methods, their ways, they try to create their own style, meaning they don't imitate it.
It means that if I do the same as him, same tone of voice, same level of words.
So I'm just imitating myself. I'm not doing anything new; I'm doing something personal to me.
So we can rely on them a little.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of young Gulf nationals in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive style, we follow this report together, benefit from it, and also enjoy seeing some of this report.
Mystery still surrounds the talent that some people possess.
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Dail
which is located away from the Saudi capital, Riyadh
One hundred fifty kilograms
He possesses exceptional ability and extensive experience.
Detection of surface groundwater sites
And depths exceeding one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is expensive
But with the expert's presence, he can determine the appropriate location for digging the well.
Of course, the way to discover or
Locating the water source
She has been around since ancient times
And they were our ancestors and our ancient forefathers.
They rely on experts to determine the locations of the wells.
For excavation
Wasa'il Abu Ibrahim in water discovery
They are not modern devices
And a soil analysis in scientific laboratories
He only relies on God's guidance in his work.
and its channels are underground
It is either pomegranate sticks.
A branch of pomegranate or a branch of fig
Now we are practically applying the process of water conduit detection.
Now it begins again, this is the end of the course.
Come back again
Come back, come back
It returns, it returns now. If so, from here, put a mark.
And from here, the watercourse ends.
Requires great experience and long patience
So that the explorer can reach the sensitivity of the tool movement
I went to more than one area.
It means a success rate of ninety-five percent.
Of course, this is the method and way to use the copper rods.
Of course, there is no precise scientific explanation.
This method
It is surprising that the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession
Exceeds ninety-five percent
Detection of the sources of surface groundwater
Glory be to Allah, He taught man what he did not know. This is a report, of course, which we took from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They worked hard, a special group, and now they have more than one CD.
Whether it's online or on the phone.
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries, between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, between Qatar and
You can download a stronger song about a stronger topic
About a problem, about, about, meaning, and so on, many topics.
Follow his example or see him as my role model, meaning I see that there is nothing.
God willing
Also, at the same time, we want to take this.
It also means a large collection of songs.
What we try as much as possible is to spread it.
You have another period ahead, let's stay in touch with you like this.
So we also know what's new, first I tell this band.
But I emphasize the name of the band
Rappers Qatar
We return again, our guests are here, and we go back to the Corniche and the beautiful atmosphere that
We are definitely with you live through the direct link we are broadcasting to you, viewers.
Wherever you are on the Corniche, celebrating the Asian Cup
Certainly, we are proud of them and proud of the different arts.
It addresses many social and psychological problems among youth.
But Youna is in the studio with two people
They will definitely complete the twenty-five.
We welcome once again Yousuf and Salman, may Allah bless you all once again.
Sometimes the subscription stops
So we're trying to reach the company, but we don't know where the company is, no one is responding to us.
I need to develop myself, at least the person who is outside.
Facebook YouTube
like websites like this
With the band
We are always available, we are always ready to go out.
You are organizing as we saw, with some, Mashallah, you did this work.
You guys put these songs together with a set of pictures—your pictures, your personality.
He uploads it on YouTube, uploads it on websites where there might be videos that one can follow.
By God, we have been down before.
And there are many songs, I mean.
The obstacles you're facing are that there is no website that requires a company to adopt you.
No, you really need a place that brings you together as a band.
These are your wishes so that you truly desire them to come true and reach the high level you aspire to.
So, we got caught.
Are you telling us, come on, we're counting on you, we're organizing for you, we're releasing an album for you.
Icon means something, means something official
Because it means now is a five-year period.
meaning nothing more than a hobby
Yes, we participated in things, we participated in programs, we participated in series.
I hope to develop Icon into
It means there's something that supports us, meaning we're always with him.
Yes, also I want to know your wishes, Salman, besides Youssef's wishes. What could you say?
The only wish is almost the music video
God willing, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this team.
Al-Taybah, and we hope, God willing, that your songs will always be present in the Arab world and the world.
And for now, this is a refined art, a widely appreciated art.
And there are messages like the ones you mentioned.
God willing, always for you, and I wish you all the best, God willing.
Say hello to the whole group for me, and good luck, God willing.
We will conclude this meeting with the song they made for the program.
With you, KD and DJ Master Bobo on the Morning Doha program
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen
This KG Mr. Bobo and SKT One Hot To Bree
I think I can say good morning, my country. Good morning, Qatar, with the Sabah Al Doha program.
Stay active and present, going directly to the air for the viewers.
And don't forget, the program starts at nine thirty in the morning, meaning every one is sitting in front of the TV.
They see one by one, they look at each other, showcasing a bit of art.
With us, the Morning of Doha program
With us in the preparation is Hassan Naaama, with us in the presentation is Shima Al-Hamadi
With us in directing is Nasser Al-Maliki, the episode's guests are Qatari rappers, for sure.
It means to repeat again and be used at home.
There is in Atrloli or this shopping cart
Anyone who shops at the supermarket or elsewhere is placed in it.
Any stuff you put in the car, anything you desire to buy.
A large screen appears for you showing the components of this item.
This was also a wonderful idea and feasible for implementation.
It just means a parking lot with a car scanner that detects this item.
And it makes it easier for the buyer, making the purchasing process easier for him.
So he takes full details on a private screen of his.
I think it would be more conscious this way.
When you have it on a device with you or with the same car
Most components
And the cautions, what are their harms as well
It contains full details, I mean.
He is ambitious, meaning for example there were about four or five projects.
Addresses traffic problems
It addresses traffic congestion and other parking problems, and it was also very creative and really nice.
Masha Allah also the Cultural Center for Childhood
Let us, Mr. Abdullah, also talk about the different activities that we will see, God willing, in the coming days.
Yes, by God, there are surprises, of course, but it was a quick pass.
Ideas, Mai, if you like, I can mention them from some of the projects that are being presented, or not.
This, for example, this underground transportation, its main smart or creative idea is that
Everyone who leaves their house means a "laft".
And they gather at a specific point
These are of course all the pictures that the viewers are watching; I expect they are enjoying them.
Children's Creative Works
Exactly, yes, this is similar to the same cash machine.
For women, for example, I have a card.
Enter this card, for example, I need a black T-shirt
This is, for example, some of the stores now or, for example, I have some lost items at home, like a key or something I don't know.
The keys I forgot, for example, are the office keys.
Our main goal is, of course, based on what Her Highness Sheikha Moza has emphasized.
His Highness the Prince's Sanctuary
During an early period, and this is of utmost importance in project design
It was also selected from among three hundred children.
Also, we have the promising preachers during Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony; she was a presenter.
For now, we love to open our hearts and doors to all the children who want to present their programs.
And after them, they set off
And our need to support this as well and their presence is one of our top priorities.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
Diversity and variety of children's skills
Self-Development
So, do you have such collaborations with some of the different youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also scientific clubs available in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on partnerships.
All our programs are specialized partnerships.
With a group of community service institutions specializing in developing these skills
He is in partnership with all the institutions interested in the field.
Photographic Society
The Girl Creativity Center, the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, also played a very significant role.
Yes, he played a significant role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children on it
Attracting and encouraging them for children, as all our programs are built on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions
And what has upset you?
Of course, our presence in Katara gave us a strong push and provided us with great support.
And the fastest shape
Currently, there are a group of projects in partnership with Katara, and preparations are underway to launch them, God willing, within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what relates to reading
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are currently in it, especially us, now is the time for preparation.
And building a promising scientific future for all children, upcoming generations, and the youth to come, God willing.
The word I would like to present to the parents, the youth who follow us, and the children who wish to be present through the center.
What we are giving now
Our children's times are filled with ideas that we do not underestimate or belittle.
We must give it attention, whatever these ideas may be.
Because really, from this idea, there is interest in it, and it will develop this idea. At the very least, I will develop the child's love for thinking.
It is very important that I pay attention.
I communicate with him spiritually, I am communicating with him now. Our biggest problem is that most fathers
Provides him with support
Provides encouragement to him in urging parents and educators
They should pay more attention to their imagination. Today's children are our future; they are the foundation of this future.
It really felt like we lived while wandering through this exhibition among their projects.
It was like living in a dream
It means in a dream, ideas are all very vast imagination.
And now the dream has become a reality; many dreams have come true and become part of reality.
And praise be to Allah. Hopefully, God willing, success for our children who were present.
Our hopes are tied to you, with God's will.
By His permission, God willing
Of different ages and genders
I reached seventy projects
They are considered pioneering and innovative projects in implementation.
To talk more about this phenomenon
National and also the Cultural Center for Childhood
Professor Abdullah also, at the beginning, briefly told us about the exhibition.
What does it encompass that gathers many events? So, what can we briefly say about this exhibition?
It was a new style of expression, a way for children to express their love, loyalty, and belonging to the homeland.
Of course, it came under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
In the exhibition tour, this exhibition came.
It starts to grow with him until it reaches twenty or thirty.
Of course, we started training children to see Qatar 2030 with its five pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, he knows now, meaning Qatar in twenty thirty, where it will reach.
Then he begins to think about how his way of thinking is.
How does one create and be innovative, coming up with creative ideas
I expect so, I mean, his field is quite broad, Mashallah.
But when we give him certain symbols like this and help him
I expect his thinking will grow bigger and bigger.
Professor, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams, Generations, Future Facts."
It is the slogan of today's generations' dreams
He will be part of Qatar's future tomorrow.
And for now, we have experienced this while walking with the children when the child speaks, he says "Haq Saad Al-Wazir."
I want you to inaugurate my project. I invite you to visit my project in 2030.
The child will think twenty years from now
It expresses his love for the homeland and what he loves most in the field.
Certainly accompanied by various activities and competition events
He was among those who won the Stars of Science award.
There were also the winners of the first prize for the Arab League University.
Of course, all children
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were displays, meaning there were different exhibits scheduled at specific times.
To showcase their projects that they have carried out during the exhibition
And Mashallah, a distinguished presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners in the projects I participated in at the exhibition
Who also won one of the main awards
What is the forest or the protected area?
Also, I want to talk about colored balls
Of course, the colorful wall was also part of our vision and the children's dream of Qatar's future.
Also thinking about twenty twenty-two
How can a child contribute to a creative idea project for twenty-two and twenty-one?
Its main idea is that there is a slice present in the ball.
Gives color when judging
If, for example, it went in or means everyone monitors the referee's movements of this ball through
And the movements of the field and what changes in it through this electronic chip
What exists in the ball
Ideas are, of course, creative. Of course, it's the main idea. Some people might be surprised and ask us many questions.
And these projects
We always say we haven't connected with the children.
In this stage of developing or enhancing these skills, broadening their horizons
I gave them an idea of how to express love for the homeland through these projects.
Giving them self-confidence on how to present their project, face the audience, and explain their idea
In his area of interest in the field he loves, all of this is considered an achievement, an achievement for him.
And support was support, I mean, he could appreciate it and thank him for it.
Now you are entering the development stages and
There is support from some officials, support from the committee, and I also expect support from the audience.
The forest was not the second one; it is the forest because of this girl.
Method for subscribers to access the channels through the pipes where visitors enter underground
Large protected forest
And the visitor wanders through it, seeing the animals—sorry, the reptiles—under the ground.
And there is a sensor on some animals and the Aykis Research Center means the state of the animals.
And in the marine environment, entering it in an equally creative way
The reason for her victory is also due to imagination, meaning the broad one in all its details.
So of course, this is their people to the...
There is of course someone talking about a tourist city under the water.
Who is talking about a city for butterflies
Who is talking about a forest, a forest above the earth
There are many people talking about many tourist ideas.
meaning exciting
Perhaps this is something children's minds are capable of now, maybe by 2030, 2050.
And perhaps in the future, these things will actually come true.
There are three projects.
The Scientific Club didn't adopt it. They said these projects are needed now. I want to work on them.
Project for example, which is the air conditioning water system.
Let's see now, the Arab newspaper
And the news says that Qatar University is celebrating its graduation
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary-General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Sheikha bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President of the University
A good achievement definitely recorded for the beautiful university.
Qatar University and also Caligari University
Also, these good news that we are reading about our male and female students.
A pioneering educational achievement, God willing, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties, God willing.
He is considered one of the young faces coming strongly into the Qatari drama scene.
And until when, also colorful classifications and threads
And the artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharshani is considered one of the artists who shaped their own identity.
If it were not convincing
He would not have been chosen to be involved in the work carried out within Qatar.
Currently, artist Abdelhamid Elsharshani is participating in the series "The Deadly Feeling" and "Tasnif" Part Two.
We are pleased to have our guest this morning
To talk with him about his participation in these two important works and about his overall experience
Hello and welcome, good morning
You illuminated the Sabah Al Doha program. This is the first time I meet you, and the first time you will be with us on Sabah Al Doha.
And the people who are tired of the program
And you are Lisa's sister
Welcome, let's get started before we begin the conversation.
Let's see what happens
I am a responsible and administrative man.
And enforce the laws
All I can tell you
Bring the Beshteh
Then listen, why do you come to me?
Go see them to find out if anyone agrees with you that you shouldn't return the Beshṭ.
I had another question to start with, but since we saw this clip from the first part of the series تصانيف
Indicating that Khalid ibn al-Walid
Some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Mar'at.
Many matters and information related to this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And for more, we follow with you this beautiful report by colleague Abdulrahman Murshid
We continue with some.
It is certainly a testimony from someone who does not know flattery or favoritism.
And to emphasize the authenticity of this city or that one
To the extent that we see its effects and hear what its narrators and poets have said about it
Their old and new, for that will come as a comprehensive record added to the city's archive.
And Maret City is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And it is an ancient city historically established in the pre-Islamic era.
Historians have disagreed on the reason for its naming.
Some of them attribute it to Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi, the famous poet.
And to the pond to which he is attributed
He does not know its date of establishment
Pre-Islamic Era
The most famous thing in the city of Marat is Jabal Kameet, which has become a proverb.
Because it is located in the city and attached to it.
Al-Jaf is also an archaeological site.
Many, and since this monument is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The Municipality of Marat has undertaken a tremendous effort in the work.
From a park above this mountain
And sessions for the parents and all the residents of the kingdom.
It was named after the noble companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him.
Fighting the apostates and Musaylimah the Liar
One of its آثار also is Ghadeer Kumayt
It is a place where floods gather and it stores water for a long period.
And one of the most important sources of water in the past era
And among its آثار also is a house that is a landmark of heritage
Marat City dates back to before Islam
She became famous for her poets whose poetry she ignited.
With its beauty, ruins, and the famous Jabal Kummayt
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid on the program Sabah Al-Dawha
Marat City north of Riyadh
We return once again to our esteemed guests
I wish we had informed ourselves and the viewers about these methods and these means.
As I mentioned earlier, we have a very special infrastructure.
We open a page for him to register, and he will have a personal file in our system.
His guardian’s email
This distraction generally increases focus, typing speed, reading speed, and distraction overall.
The guardian will have full control.
Good, this report is added to the student's file.
On his son's file via the internet
And he sees how much his son is progressing.
And he checks his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
So that we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl
We brought most of the children present at the center and send them our warmest greetings.
I entered this center with Professor Taya, who is present through this center.
And we get to know her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, from her admission to this center.
Of course, the year
He focuses on work and after Ramadan.
But of course, this always involves unfairly favoring certain works at the expense of others.
And some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
And he stays up with the television, and the month of worship passes while people are with the television.
Shh, quiet down, quiet down, reduce the series, quiet down, let it be done in the two years, isn't that better?
Of course
God willing, they will accept me in Ramadan.
But God willing, I send you all my regards.
And God willing
And also in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion
A fashion show was held at the Katara Cultural Village.
Certainly, we continue with you with all love and sincerity
and enhances children's abilities and skills even more
Different from the various schools present in this generous homeland
We have a certain model; we talked with our guests who were with us.
Now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amani?
Praise be to God
Which class are you currently in?
Professor Ibrahim, initially, let's get to know the subjects that are offered through this center.
And as an example of that, Mrs. Amani
We will also go with her the method or way that teacher Nesma talked about.
You feel like there's been a change in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods
Things were changing regarding his skills, his mind, and even his educational level would change.
Scientific methods
This is because initially, I perform a global test called the Toney Test for the child before starting anything else in my program.
I am starting to do the second part of the Tuni test as well.
We measure through it the level or the difference in level of the student.
Now, a quick math test or questions will be conducted.
Amani will count and respond via Hawa immediately
Of course, Omnia has no idea at all about these questions.
We are on their side regarding this matter.
Of course, I had another question to start with.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second round.
What does your participation tell us about her?
Of course, after we presented a single classification series
Of course, الحمدلله, God has granted me success in several roles.
Professor Ghanem
He distributes the roles, of course, with the executive director Ashraf Shahat and the great professor.
Of course, an opportunity from Tar for Artistic Production.
Honestly, the youth's right
Professor Ghanem, of course, this year Rasha nominated me, maybe.
Of course, each episode is different
I have several episodes where I will create characters.
And on the contrary, this is a nice experience, of course, we are present at work.
The pyramid of the Kuwaiti pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah Malik Ali Al-Ghurayr
We have a proverb like Ali Mirza.
With you also a group of young people, Abdullah Adham
We still have among the youth Abdullah Al-Asam.
This has been going on for a year and a year; we work two jobs a year.
Maybe this is the reason Apple Air asked you if you have been serving since 1997.
But I didn't realize that achieving something or your ambition is possible through art.
Praise be to Allah in all circumstances
You are correct; art is study, or is it just something else?
It's not a talent I have.
I took art as a talent, of course, the one who supported me at the beginning was the artist Abdulaziz Jassim, of course.
I'm one of the artists who considers me like his son.
Anything I have to say
Of course, we're all with the series.
We went out, gave it our all, and thank God.
Now, if it weren't for Tara, a big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti. A very big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman.
If you're comparing us to Kuwait, in Kuwait, in the year twelve to fourteen, a new representative appears. Why?
They have
Certainly, thank you very much, I mean you're giving opportunities.
But let's just say it.
We are talking about the Sanai series; we discussed it and got an idea about it.
The deadly feeling too
And the foot also, a foot of a man
And with us, there is definitely a model; with us is the therapist Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Maiouf Al-Tamimi
Until this operation is performed live on air
Let's see how we can treat the personality. For example, first, let me greet Mr. Sobhi Abdullah. Welcome.
Hello and welcome. Peace and mercy of Allah be upon you.
If we start with you, sir, please go ahead.
God willing
In the name of God, of course
We hold the hand
We see the nerves
It is as if a drawing or a message from God, the Most High, showing all the organs of your body.
What are its internal problems?
Sometimes you feel dizzy
Headache and dizziness
Relax your hand, relax, calm your nerves, yes
So, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover a certain thing through his hand that indicates he suffers from a specific disease.
The person on the left has a mild middle ear infection.
In the meantime, what does this mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
You have a problem with your ear.
Who created me when I was young
Here I also feel pain
The sinuses
S. Al-F Khishm, a headache is coming to you here
I have a headache here
He has a problem with the sinuses.
She is causing him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating
So, his thyroid is a bit tired. Do you have fatigue and lethargy? Always a heaviness in the body.
Excessive sleep
So much sleep or laziness, I always feel like it's heavy.
Chronic tonsillitis
Look, see the trembling, you notice the tremor
He has stress and of course you never walk barefoot, maybe the last time.
Brother from Tunisia, hi
Mashallah, you told us things about him and about his presence.
Is this massage also suitable for children?
Pain is true, pain is glory, glory be to Allah, measured by the size of a child's belly.
Most of our children are like this.
When he lifts, it's not that he loves lifting; people think he loves lifting, but he actually has a stomach with gases, may God bless you.
As soon as the mother places her hand, she explains like this, extending the thumb.
Icon on the child's palm
Hands interviews Icon the child opposite her
Let's just see if every mother can learn this move.
You start pressing like this: right, left, right, left.
This is a matter about the child and about the child, it's nice like that.
Well, regarding the discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women.
Like we said, in every house ninety percent, mashallah, may God protect them from women.
First thing and first warning: ceramic and flat ground
When we walk barefoot on the ceramic, of course, our problem is what if we keep walking barefoot, maybe only on a flat surface, this is dangerous.
Walk barefoot or the evidence is that the increase in health problems is due to the lack of ceramic tiles in homes
Because the land is cold and flat
When she was brushing, there were problems, they complained of asthma.
Increased more
The girl is keen to focus on walking barefoot on the heel.
This is the heel area of the foot, which is the back of the heel.
From here, this foot now is below the heel
This is the first discovery; the second discovery is on its way to facilitating childbirth.
Just focus a little.
In the seventh or ninth month
As soon as you enter the month of birth, generally
It means that in the eighth, the danger is greater, and the most dangerous thing is to walk barefoot.
The pregnant woman pays attention to walking barefoot
If you enter the delivery room
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. Shake the palm tree towards you; it will drop fresh dates upon you.
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, her sustenance was brought to her.
So, look, I even discussed with scholars of knowledge, and they told me, why did you change Ibn Kathir's interpretation?
I am not the one who gives you the idea that God placed in this knowledge and inspired me with it.
I shake the palm trunk to you when I shake the palm, of course, how are you coming?
Sharp like the example you gave, like pins or nails
When she shook the palm tree, she gave orders to the wombs, which sometimes are heavier wombs in the middle here.
The intestines gave us orders to facilitate childbirth and modify the fetus.
The height of the fetus's head or something adjusts along the way and becomes normal.
Glory be to Allah, how much this fruit has benefits.
Hold the hand, start and calm it down
Some of them take it as a habit, and some of them know that it is actually knowledge.
They are afraid to tell you, and you don't believe in them.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz, I mean, Mashallah, your discoveries are important.
I just wanted to know, the last question, I mean, the time is going so fast, mashallah.
Anyone who wants to get in touch with you, is there a specific email they should use to contact you? Are you the one?
Alright, the mobile is here in the control room for anyone who wants to contact Mr. Abdulaziz and call us after the program.
Of course, the Qatar TV numbers so they can contact us and I took this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we hold this belief, God will bless your work and keep people away.
Sin as people sin and do everything, meaning whatever comes to your mind, a normal person.
We only aspire for more good than
Always think positively
Our viewers, I hope you also enjoyed this segment, of course, about reflexology and massage by hand.
Also by foot
And we saw a live example on air of how the person with us discovered what symptoms he has.
And what does it mean if we hope for your benefit, and anyone who wants to can definitely contact him, and he can also read about it online.
How to implement it in the coming days and years if more schools are to be included
Good morning
How can I benefit from this experience
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The real problem of obesity in the Gulf countries has become a major issue.
We feared that Qatar would lead the fifth country along with them.
And this program means, honestly, that the First Lady in New York has happened.
They visited Doha, and they had a program for this.
So they presented it to us, and we adopted it; no problem.
It means our students with New York students, with students, I mean, Spain with students, England with students.
So I look into how our brothers, our students in Qatar, are doing compared to the rest of the world, and this is something we want for the future.
Because we encourage eating fruit among students.
He stops playing sports
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with the family.
Of course, this is killing two birds with one stone.
Of course, in the sixth week, he says, what did he benefit from this experience? Today, thank God, we are at the conclusion.
We are happy at the student.
Find out, they were three independent boys' schools, Abu Ubaida
Independent girls Raqiya
Our morale is high
It means the family is aware, their brothers got excited at home and started eating this food like them, I mean.
It became a contagious relationship among students, and this culture is even transferred to his home and to his family.
He goes and tells them that I was like this, for example, or that they taught me this way.
The training staff or those who provided this information to the students
How did you choose him? How was communication with the students conducted, and through whom?
Yes, by God, may Allah reward them all well. Several entities have helped us, meaning they have made us happy.
And we have the brothers at the Diet Center, teach them about healthy eating as well.
And learn with sister Aisha Al-Tamimi the etiquette, the etiquette, the eating etiquette
How do they organize themselves, I mean, how do they eat, how do they arrange things, what are the priorities?
For teaching cooking or sports or awareness, the benefit of healthy food
It was in the form of separate lessons, neither curricula nor
How was the delivery of these ideas to the students?
In various ways, some of which were inside the school.
We started the program with a day in Aspire Zone, where we gathered all the boys and girls students.
Because this issue is not about a specific person, it concerns us all because these are our children.
They guided the students on how to work with them initially.
It means that the results were satisfactory.
But is it enough to have three schools or specific classes from these schools?
He is now, of course, the first experiment in the world; as soon as things start, they don't begin on a large scale.
It starts on a reasonable good scale with all the qualities: boys, good boys, girls, independent, private.
So that it doesn't conflict with, for example, our culture, our environment, or family circumstances. Families, for instance, accept certain things for their children but not others.
Fibonacci, they actually mean to participate in it, and it is truly important.
It means the student is twelve or thirteen years old; this is the appropriate age to learn about their health.
It means this is a hardship because many people, I swear, wish they were weak, but they imagine it as impossible.
It means some of the heroes we see in movies like this with weak bodies, saying this is like some kind of supernatural thing, no.
We talked in detail, but unfortunately, there are many weeks we couldn't cover.
Maybe through a morning in Doha, we can also remind them of it again.
And the fruits that contain, I mean, vitamin B, which you can get from fruits or vegetables.
So man knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, his health begins to improve, giving him morale.
They used to go to the supermarket and choose their fruit.
So, this is a point, for example.
That is, diversification. Of course, they competed; each school excelled with its teachers using unique ideas.
The spirit of competition is the spirit of the
We gave them the overall picture, and everyone is free to be creative.
The teachers are the ones who trained the students, or do you have a special staff?
We train them, we train them
But I mean, the teachers used to add, for example, some schools like Abu Ubaida, saying that on Saturday we will do activities for the students.
For example, this day outside school hours, they decided to adopt Raqiya School and said they would hold a march.
We will have a healthy cooking day for girls, okay? We didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking themselves, so the girls had more skill in this area.
Of course, thanks to Al Rayyan Water, they provided the water completely free of charge to the schools. Al Rayyan Water in this matter.
So, of course, more healthy water because he will need to purify his body from all these toxic substances that enter his body daily through the water.
This week we said the third
It means his body started to move.
He can play football or basketball, but he doesn't know that this is the sport I love.
Exactly, exactly, and some of them might want other games, some of them might not want a multiplayer game.
How long is the live broadcast?
Professor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, Founder and Director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Patients Association. Welcome.
And of course, we try as much as possible to focus on most of the important topics.
We would like to introduce ourselves and our dear viewers to what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this name might also be somewhat strange to us. Please go ahead.
The number of women affected is greater than the number of men
All currently available treatments are preventive treatments.
White blood cells that are supposed to protect us start fighting us
We fought with the nerve cell strike.
The easiest one for the audience is a piece of electrical wire.
Covered with a layer called the softener to shake it off; it's a nylon layer.
It generally leads to imbalance, double vision, and blurred vision.
Leads to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems
Leads to madness in its worst cases, resulting in quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments
The most important functions in the human body that can be severely disrupted.
And I have this disease called multiple sclerosis.
Theories suggest that his transmission is viral.
It is a non-contagious disease.
And it does not transfer to children
Some consider it a disease depending on the region
But the equator, for example, was completely far from this disease.
Currently, we have cases on the equator infected with this disease.
This disease still has no treatment because its cause is unknown.
Until now, scientists have been unable to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a cure.
The current process is a reverse process.
They try to avoid the effect of the disease itself on the human body.
They try to start from the back, in other words.
And perhaps we are a bit worried about this issue, which means we can say that this disease might suddenly come.
There is a certain group that feels this disease is spreading among a specific age group.
It was globally classified from twenty to forty years ago.
Currently, the International Organization for the Disease itself has lowered the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because he has been hitting the falconer with the age of forty years.
But it does not heal from the human.
Of course, as a syndicate, we are open even to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, that is through the Qatar Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
What is the reason for the existence of this association?
Currently, a large collection, so you thought there should be a link for this topic.
Of course, I will give you approximate numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are eleven thousand infected.
A thousand injured
The rest of the Gulf countries have an infection rate between one hundred and three hundred.
I was diagnosed five years ago.
My number was sixty-four or sixty-six.
Are there some symptoms that clearly indicate to a person that they actually have this disease?
And we don't have confirmation that it's a virus, so we don't want to adopt a specific theory. That's a point.
The second point: How do I know if I am infected or not?
This is very difficult
I got lost, Professor Abdulaziz, through an attempt to find a specific point.
