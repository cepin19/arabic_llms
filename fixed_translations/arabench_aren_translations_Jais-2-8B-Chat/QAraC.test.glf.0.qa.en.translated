If you don't want it, I want it.
O Sultan, what are you going to say?
It is a shame on you, a chance, a chance, has come our way. We have the power to seize it, to not let it slip away from us. It is a shame.
Then, I'm not being stubborn about this. I have the right to take it, and you actually have the right to take it from me.
Sultan, and may God have mercy on your parents, do not bring us problems.
Saleh, don't become like this, I seek forgiveness from Allah.
I swear to you, is there a brother who would advise his brother about what he is telling him?
You are hungry.
I found in front of you a Chinese dish, so live and be well.
The Chinch has no master, no keeper, no boundaries.
Stand by yourself for the truth.
This Chinese thing isn't put in front of us again.
Don't be a dog, Saleh.
And we wasted the opportunity. And we missed the opportunity.
No, don't try, it's impossible, it's impossible, it's not me who would do that.
The problem is that he is afraid.
What is he afraid of?
This is a government project, where everyone takes and sucks.
This is a rule.
Now, some people who are not involved in the projects are taking...
He is the chairman of the project committee for a large project.
I mean what does it mean? He has the thread and he has everything under control.
Project of the Global Beaches for the Millennium, between the parentheses, the infrastructure framework, the first phase.
The bull fell upon him.
This is what has the vacuum cleaner.
If he hasn't taken...
And it's none of your business.
You have the right to take from their project.
When his car was broken down.
Who was the one who would reach the project location, not me?
No, if that's the case, you have every right.
Who gives you the right to oil your car four and five times?
Leave it to me.
Do not become a monkey and act like you own the place.
Extend your hand and scratch.
جوف خميس ريل خالتك
Now, according to you, they tell you you're a millionaire.
One-third of the total amount is the project's due.
And a third of it is commission.
He was kicked out of the folk group.
They told you they're having a party for the country.
And they bought us fine water.
They did it.
We put the row.
There is no use, my aunt.
May God guide him, God willing.
And he eats this with him.
I spent the night yesterday trying to work with him.
This is an opportunity.
For the good to be widespread.
And God willing, it will spread.
This is a known thing.
The matter's prophet will be between us.
Come out, don't come in.
After he needs a recommendation.
Just the quarter.
A problem that can stop for us like a bone in the throat.
The Real seemed to be softening.
Sitting with him today.
It is two hours in the morning.
And he began to be convinced.
Later, we will have a meeting with him.
And we have to work on it, me and you, just fine.
He whose actions will cut off our livelihood.
They only started listening to him, hoping his head would be okay.
My brother Ali, my brother Othman.
I don't know.
Assuming that today is my first day back.
Don't worry.
How is it not going to happen?
Sure, but are you absolutely sure I'm taking, meaning...
Now I am just asking you.
You are hungry and not on the right path.
Whether you eat or not.
I am the type of eater.
It's okay / You're welcome
Chinese, return.
We are just at the first item of the meeting.
If you can,
And if you have any apprehension/concern/fear
I am the one I want to know.
We are from the project.
God guide you, but oh Saleh.
You can because it's the first time you participated as a chairman of a committee in a government project.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **And this is simple, and I am your brother.**
We take our share.
From within the project's budget.
How is that even possible?
To make sure no one feels the story.
We put a clause to go to the amount.
This amount was confiscated.
By the representatives of the project.
It will not happen.
No, no, no, oh Saleh.
You know the manners.
It seems you have a little bit of fear inside you.
This is definitely his right.
To the beginning and the end.
It means everything is in our hands.
The translati
What's wrong? In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. What's wrong?
He told you the new car of his friend, you believed him.
Here he is, saying it.
The car is his friend, okay, good.
And in a distinguished location.
None, but one with money is...
I won't tell you, someone already told me, or I heard.
He who bought the land and registered it in his name.
He asked me, please.
Now he has the money in his hand.
Now it is attracting.
We are not related.
Okay then.
What is the meaning of "al rash"?
He takes us out through the East Gate.
He wants to go and eat a bite.
Do not shake your head.
And if not, your brother.
Come sit and don't worry, just enjoy the good mood and come.
I kept him company all night.
He killed him, it's not important who he is, he deserves it.
When I let him, he agreed.
And this is supposed to be
God willing, you won't take it all at once, that's it.
This is the project for the Global Beaches Project for the Third Millennium.
Between the parentheses, the infrastructure.
They returned later and then began the second phase.
And you continue with him.
May God reward you with the best; you have done more than enough.
The one you let stay, he just agrees.
And you are in the same situation as others.
But it's not a big deal.
Just God willing, you convinced him.
We want a share.
They are all in agreement regarding
Even told me after he agreed.
It seems they are inviting their colleagues to attend a meeting to determine the budget for the project.
Whatever their lawful business and they must follow it.
We are sure of it and have it confirmed.
We will present it as quickly as possible so that it can be approved.
Take your time.
Who is this brother of yours that you know?
This will become the brother of the wife, a contributor with me.
This means this.
You have the doors, windows, and everything else related to finishing.
Sweet sweet
How much more do you need for me to finish?
You have the right to determine for yourself.
We take something.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And we determine the amount we are taking.
And we have people waiting and wanting.
The speech of Abdulaziz is just.
Which one and he specifies for himself half a million.
This week, his soul will be at rest.
And he determines the amount he wants.
Have they decided, thought, and determined?
What's up how are you
As you wish.
Do not do this. This is a harmful command. I cannot fulfill a command that could lead to harm.
What is your friend in? What is inside you? What is wrong with this?
I have no idea what God has forced upon us.
What are you, from Egypt, inside this project? You, huh.
This is a money drink from the government.
Saleh, your brother's name is Sultan.
This is the key/ring to our neighbor's house.
Sometimes it leads us to a point where the car breaks down.
Register with you.
Abdullah's Bond
No, there are three others after him.
What should I do with it? I'm fed up with it.
I'll just tell him, O'ud, let's get our budget sorted and done.
No, no, this is a lump sum.
And I put it for him.
This poor man, he has children.
He has, give him more, let it be twenty-five quarters, or a hundred.
And three-quarters of one hundred.
His worry is sticking to us tightly.
How many will you distribute among them?
Many returned.
The good mother, at the mention of him.
Yes, mom.
This is the last one, oh father.
No, oh father, you want to go to Thailand to get treatment.
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
What's wrong with you, acting like it's such a big deal?
It remains only from the first phase, enclosed in parentheses, the underlying structure.
Not used
Add to them three thousand.
Buy me some hours from Thailand that have all the magnets and they sparkle like that.
Here I recorded it.
Which of my imams
No, oh my, I recorded it, I just wanted to make sure you were okay with the name.
My love, I tell you, oh mother.
The Chinese dragon.
Okay, here's the translation of your input, based on your specific instructions for this task: **Translation:** Yes, but then the budget needs to be set, it cannot remain completely open like that.
Tomorrow, I will cancel the meeting, and everyone will say the amount they are thinking of.
Oh, dear (or to you).
A million is enough.
My love, very much.
Hey everyone, everyone, wait, what's the disturbance? Give us a chance.
The committee is meeting as usual, about to approve the project budget, which has now been closed. The matter of funds is now settled.
I keep increasing.
We told you to be quiet about the scandal, sitting in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh, my God, don't expose us!
Oh, has anyone asked what's with you all being gathered here?
We said, "We got the electricity down, and there's a hit to it."
They disturbed us with a commotion in the ministry's courtyard.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Yallah geb yallah geb
Did you hear?
Oh man, were you with them for how long or how much did you get for the budget?
Without my brother.
With the project, all of us, I mean all of us, are fifty million.
This is the first phase, but only fifty million.
How much is the amount?
This is Saleh.
O Yemen, guardian of the middle, be safe.
Well, you're welcome, and I hope you feel well.
Oh God, come on now, lighten up, let's get to work, the group, the beneficiaries, they're all waiting for us, you know.
It's not a problem, the most important thing is that we don't want discussions. They should rely on the budget and that's it.
And from tomorrow, we will begin implementing the project.
and serves a very large segment of society
This is a project, may God protect it, for the Global Beaches Project of the Third Millennium.
This, may God keep you, is the first stage.
Between the parentheses, the infrastructure.
This project is for the sake of future generations.
Of course, in the name of the program's family, we would love to congratulate and bless you as well on the opening of the project, which, I believe, will be tomorrow, God willing.
And it took 1,000,000 years and half a year to work on it.
His age is one and a half years.
Once again, of course, in the name of the program "Future العطاءات"
This project...
And for future generations.
May God continue to bless us with the oil wealth.
Second, third, tenth stages.
In the presence of an envoy.
Welcome!
They really want us to stay here, when will the cars come to pick us up?
Where are they taking us, what's wrong?
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds. You've grown old and senile, you are.
We all sat in the sun, dying from the heat.
Oh, daughter of good people.
That's all I have.
No one is near me except the sea.
Why did they take you?
Iman told me that your sister, Munira, is Ahani.
About the story of my father's land that is in the middle of the desert.
I said what is just, then look at who told her false news and exaggerated stories.
This is not the Earth.
Just when one discovers an isolated homestead in the wild, one says, "This is my father's."
Then what are you doing with these stories?
You have brothers.
He denies that there is Mashallah, and they invest in the land, they work hard, and also in real estate and companies.
Who is the one with the head?
Oh, my, Iman!
And then my sister
How do you mean you don't know?
They will give it to me, against their will.
These two are brothers.
And nothing is more beautiful than honesty.
Because of the money.
We became the ones to give her money, to take her to the hospital.
How old is she now? In court with her brothers.
Nineteen years if not more.
Don't return.
Brothers of Um Salmin, thieves.
He returned, and yesterday, you were telling me.
My father, only my son, give me a drink before I die.
You don't know.
I am not saying that the Muslim Brotherhood are like that, God forbid.
Now, my father passed away, around a year ago.
Why now, coming to ask?
And she saw the homestead.
I want after.
Not every three months does a jig go to it.
A falcon, it seems, has gifted us something, allowing us to finally understand what the story is about.
Not as you wish.
We swear, by God, they are our sisters whom we don't see aريال (aريال is a currency unit, often referring to the Saudi Riyal or other regional currencies).
The solution is with me.
From where
It's not as if my money is there.
Munira Shagov
And whoever will hand you over, his insides will be yours.
It became fifty thousand.
Because I dared to ask about my father's land out in the middle of nowhere.
I am sure my rights are more than that.
Each one living in that desert.
And their children are in the best schools.
I'll tell you, O minيرة.
I am not quiet about my right.
I'll take my share.
We invest our money in the company, it's better for you, no, I don't have money.
Each one on top of the other.
Mercy died in people's hearts.
Don't you say the Brotherhood will come out better than my brothers.
Ginny, it's me.
Twelve years.
And I am struggling in these courts.
And in the end
You took neither what was right nor what was wrong.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: **"Okay, here is the translation, as requested: انزين اهمه ليش ايسوون جذي"**
For this reason, I tell you, oh mother, be lenient with them.
Take them with ease/gentleness.
This appears
Okay and why do courts take all these years?
We are all four hundred thousand.
If we reach millions like other countries.
By God, oh mother, I don't think even a sentence will be issued.
Gofi, you are my brothers.
I swear, oh mother, I don't have anything wrong with me.
Oh my mother, what should I say?
I am not saying anything about Qir. We are relying on God, and the best disposer of affairs against the oppressor.
Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.
Did you not have a court date a week ago?
Has it become, oh mother, after?
The judge says, "Write a memorandum."
And here we are, oh mother, from one memory to another.
Here, they are investing millions, and you are just looking on.
And with what, as you said to me, with what are you going to do?
No mistake, right?
For this reason, I would say, "If I were you..."
Shut up about what they give me.
Because the time
It's your father's business with us.
Men are asking you.
Here it is, about having meaning.
Some questions, I mean, about her, about her share, and so on.
Do you just want to meet, hang out, and that's it?
If I don't guide him.
Throw it away and replace it.
My father, Abuhdhulf, will go.
Do you expect us to provide a written waiver?
Two hundred and fifty is a lot for her to handle. Her employers should be working.
It turns out, or you can just hit your head in the circle.
What made her speak now?
But it is greed.
And no paradise was my destiny.
My father inherited, and he sets what you want, or how you want it.
No, neither I nor he determine.
This is God's command.
Why are they torturing my father in his grave?
I expected my siblings to come out like this.
This money means nothing.
She has been working for thirty-four or forty years.
I don't know what to do, Nasser.
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to know about.
I have no idea how much they make.
Even the company.
You have the right to go and get to know everything.
And I am not like them.
How do you go back to them?
It's not up to you.
And not according to how you want it, I have the right to access everything.
Agency without a doorman.
I am his legal agent.
This document allows him to have this official power of attorney, enabling him to access everything we have in the company.
Saad Falcon
Hooray, may his tongue be long!
Falcon, that's it.
O Nasser
Excuse me, I am taking it.
Under your command, your highness.
Oh my God, you are in front of me.
Excuse me, but let's go.
Don't let him catch us doing something.
Definitely now, if he goes and complains.
He said, "You are his energy."
It means we leave him as he pleases.
In his hand, an official document.
Formal, we can't prevent it.
He has the right to access everything, every single thing.
If the budget and accounts are dry.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If the budget is tight and you check carefully.
Multiply twelve by eight.
She divided her portion into three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much it comes out to?
This is what I'm asking for with it.
This is separate from when knowledge about territories and projects is known.
And we were happy.
We are not afraid of what? We are not afraid.
He wants welcome, this one is not needed.
He will go, he will act, he and her.
They give their sisters small amounts of money to live on.
A married woman.
Her husband provides for her.
I want money, that's it.
Hey, this is the right talk.
At your command.
Leave him at his ease.
Even my office.
My brother Rashid, meaning this was supposed to be from the beginning.
Under your command.
file file
When I knew, I inherited her true legacy.
The translation of "غير الفلل والاراظي اللي ما تدري عنها" is: **"Other than the villas and plots that you are unaware of."**
They turned out to be seven.
Look at sixteen Earths.
Here, looking at her blindness,
I was shocked, poor thing.
By God, it is a shame.
Stay behind them.
And may God have mercy on your parents, father, do not bring me a case to the court.
The most precious thing a human being has.
The coldest thing the spiteful have.
Text minute
And then he will say his usual word.
for seven, four, two thousand and I don't know how much
You see Eid with them, oh father.
You're not supposed to leave the room at all, Mom.
God, heal you, God willing.
No, the house is your house, what's the matter?
We are filming, and my sister is next.
After we arrested him at the door and expelled him from the company.
He's looking for someone from the people he was with at school, and he's looking for them.
One whose name is Abdullah.
Which came back
Go away.
It means he can influence them.
God willing, he will be able to.
yes, yes, yes
You do not resort to the courts.
The courts see what is behind it, except for memorandums.
And the lawyers delayed and slaughtered, defending the last thing.
The years passed.
And the age passes.
And you do not take anything from them, not even a single dirham.
May God have mercy on her, Umm Salmin.
She instructed me just one day before she died.
She told me to bear it, that I would end up in court.
My judge, our courts like this...
She died without taking a single piza from her inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge.
How would it have been if we were like the second of the countries?
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Years have passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
May God keep you for each other.
The most important thing
The gathering and brotherhood.
Rashid's brother
You are like a brother to me.
Do not abandon the problems, money, and...
Do you have another topic besides the topic of my sister that you are talking about?
You, please.
And why should I silence him?
He is right.
Scorning me for my father's lawful sustenance.
Yesterday my mom was telling me about your brother-in-law Saad.
And her father is a correspondent at the ministry.
It's all from my father's honest earnings.
We have been patient all this time.
Let's give this final attempt.
I texted them your friend Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, so they behaved rudely towards him and kicked him out.
What will the preacher Imam Abdurahman do with them?
Really good.
He told me, God willing, O Nasser.
May it be good.
I threaten them with the court.
You forgot about the late Um Salmeen and her arguments regarding the courts.
The brothers of Um Salem might have it as normal in court.
Just my brothers.
Any fears they have about what other people think, they can overcome it by grilling.
They could say it's a shame to go to court, what would people say about us?
Let's see what the preacher, Abdul Rahman Shabat, will do.
May God greet you and welcome you.
His speech is a gathering. His speech is a gathering.
You don't have it, grab the door.
What are you saying, my son?
He is telling the truth.
Here, come out, come on, get up.
Tomorrow morning I am going to the court.
And why postpone until tomorrow?
Then I am the one to decide, not you.
What does it mean, from now until later, tomorrow?
Hello my brother Rashid
Here is a word from me.
I have killed you before.
I will threaten them in court.
Right now he is begging me to postpone my trip.
Because they dry up the truth, my love.
It is necessary to go to your sister, Nour.
What is this?
What did you tell me this is, may God protect you.
Greetings to those present.
A very small model of a courthouse.
May God keep you safe.
Greetings to those present.
May your nose be safe.
You just said it.
Don't go today.
Let it be until after tomorrow.
To God, may He protect you, I am preparing for this office for the building of the court.
We are ready, we got tired of it, it will be a revelation, the path.
Those who entered from this door
The first thing we do when we enter.
Will you put all your things?
Phone from some iron, so it doesn't do what beep beep beep beep beep.
You will be registered in the case. He will tell you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight. You will take the elevator.
You are going around in circles.
Gawfi the judge, if you are in need, for example a certain judge.
Here are some things
You want to complain about us.
Come and show her the way.
And when will you take your right?
You take the six hundred thousand.
Like he said
Goodbye
He came back today for our dinner at my sister's house.
Ooh, they approved his ministry for his project, Abu Walid.
My sister is telling me, "I'm flying from the happiness, I can't believe it."
He told me to approve my project for your dinner with me.
Yalla, alhamdulillah. After the share that he, he, only once.
God, what a joy for you now, oh Mr. Walid.
Who is as great as he?
My sister is telling me yesterday she didn't come to sleep from joy.
He returned, glory be to God, oh Manal.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English: "By the way, Abu Walid has no business with these kinds of talk, but God has made it easy for him by providing good, honest children for him."
God willing, tell your father.
Forgive us, we are at fault.
What is the matter, oh Abu Walid?
May God keep you, Abu Walid. You did not fall short.
May God enrich you and multiply your blessings, God willing.
Good cook, by God, Waleed's mother.
Got it now, I'll put a good accountant for you and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me, "You just rent the office space, and leave the rest to us."
Here you go, Uncle.
Oh my darling, the apple of my eye.
My father, BlackBerry.
We want to build a big house.
Look at him, turn his face.
Dad, it wasn't us who agreed today to give a speech after the meal.
And now, esteemed audience, with the word of the project owner, "My father, Abu Walid," may he graciously take the floor for a few words. Thank you.
Forgive us.
Congratulations, congratulations, oh Abu Waleed.
You deserve, you deserve, God bless you, you deserve.
But honestly, what is it with you and business and trade?
Oh Riyal, this project has a story, oh my friends.
How is theتلي?
Look how much, thank God.
That year.
The Japanese national team is playing with us today.
I am in Souq Waqif.
I don't know about him.
This is a catalog of a multi-ministerial manufacturing factory. We have potential clients who have approached us.
Any Moroccan who builds for you.
He doesn't understand.
Any contractor
To the Japanese, this is not a game.
It will stop, but it will still tell you about the computer.
I wanted cinema.
I wanted it to be a kitchen, knock on the kitchen.
I'll tell you, the day I submitted the catalog for the committee, it was for the ministry.
How is your agreement with the factory? زين شلون اتفاقك مع المصنع
I paid them an amount.
Introduction means
The most important thing is to reach an agreement with the factory.
I signed it, thank God.
And they gave me an extension as well, meaning I placed my first order.
That's enough, I'm fed up.
They adopted it, true.
Just wait for a signature from Abu Fahad.
Here's what your secretary tells you.
He told me that Abu Fahad said he didn't come to work.
I will order you a drink.
Hey Abu Waleed, what did you do?
The problem is with Fahd, I can't get to know him. He might come and he might not.
Today exists
It has no time.
Okay, here is the tr
You are the manager here.
Tebi Bu Fahd yidhbaani
He must be the one to sign.
The hollow of all these files is filling my office and I need it signed by Abu Fahd.
Solution means
May God help you.
It's 2:15, Abu Walid.
The shift is over.
I don't think that Bofهد will come.
May God help you. Come tomorrow.
You are saying that the manager has known you for a long time and is your friend.
What's wrong with you?
A manager like this one made me dizzy, I swear I'm going crazy. I'm sitting there, taking pictures, but all I have on my desk is just worlds.
I blame time; we are sitting at our desks.
It's a loss, but the starch that was in their guacamole.
I stopped the office and say it's a chance. I'm at a chance.
I mean, they can't do anything, can they?
They will not move a chair without the command of Abu Fahad.
Yesterday, the manager didn't ask about you.
And the interests of God's creation, are they hindered?
So your appearance today, you will still go to them.
And he's in a mess, I swear.
Every day passes, a problem for me.
Because the factory gave me an extension.
God willing, no. By God, he won't say it.
Okay, and if they ask about you?
Not just you, waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
All are waiting for the signature of Abu Fahad.
I expect any arrival today.
Rest you.
Or go for a walk.
If he goes, I will call you.
If something happens, I will talk to you, but you should not call and panic the neighbors, poor things.
Yalla, with salama.
You guys got spooked by the madam.
Hey boy, it's been a month since we agreed to my appointment.
Just when the man is about to fall, oh man, what is this talk?
Dad, the registration deadline is slipping away for my daughter at university. The mission papers are yet to be completed, Dad.
And my problem is with the factory, the delay, the delay.
You wait a little.
All your transactions will be signed.
The Real drinks his coffee, but when it's gone, they'll have a go at him.
Enough, he told you to be quiet, enough.
May your age be long.
Goodbye
Hold on, hold on, everyone.
moment, where are you going, wait a bit
Understand what happened.
What happened after?
I have looked at his travel for an important task.
He has a special door.
This is a state.
Brother, our interests have stalled, brother.
Every day, I'm an inter, an inter, a moved.
What should we do? Wait, Abu Fahd.
The postman, how much does he charge?
God blamed whoever blamed.
He finds her, where, or not where.
The factory in Japan.
The following text was translated
And your aunt from a different direction.
She is poor, he gave him money.
He finds her from where or where.
يمه ana wajid khayif 'ala abi
Don't leave him on his own.
Who are you talking to?
Hello from
Good man, Abu Waleed.
To be told the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait, Abu Fahad, oh.
I mean, come on, for how long should I wait?
Nothing comes out on their tongues except...
This is us, waiting for Bofhed.
Oh father, you are not being unfair to me.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: My friends, they are all going to resume studies at the university next week.
What are you doing, father?
The phone, father.
May it not be your intention, only a good one, be patient, but you...
Okay, who are you going to talk to?
Come on, wait for Bufahd.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
You waited on us a lot.
May God help you.
His son, Walid, his condition is not good.
I caught him, my boat, full of hot air, was shaking and trembling.
Because the deadline is very close to ending.
He has five days left.
He will lose all his money.
Allah is sufficient for me against them.
Which is better, Attirni, Attirni, Attirni?
God willing, it will be better.
This is a wonderful experience.
The text above is gibberish.
Under a building, the second one, it doesn't move.
My brothers have left me fifty percent.
I got a discount yesterday.
I won't be late.
Your matters, God willing, will all turn out well.
My sister did not fall short.
She said, "I'm waiting for my money a little bit."
May God reward her with good.
I was freed from my sister, but...
Our manager appeared to us; may God help us with him, our manager.
Apparently, our manager overheard something.
God knows what he intends, this manager.
I find her, either from him or from Bofhed.
He made me suffer, God, and it's a problem.
And tomorrow is the last day.
It makes my halal (permissible) go bad.
God does not inspire art.
Sow the brain, sow the brain.
Where can you pull it to speak?
You bring a gun from a connected person.
Brother Abu Walid
I am connected to you because you have broken my heart.
Just keep a standby on the phone.
Goodbye
You have always been a committed person.
We used to consider you an example.
Don't think I'm oblivious to your outings every day after work.
I am capable of taking revenge on you.
And then with this mobile
I instead of deducting from you.
I put you in the inventory committee.
You are going today with them for the inventory.
Come on, don't you dare try to sneak out of work.
And if you go out
Do not blame me afterwards.
Poor guy, today is his last chance.
The hollow extended, the Amyod the phone, waiting to be called.
I'm afraid he will get fired from his job.
Oh Abu Walid, my phone that rang.
It breaks the heart.
Let the poor man go.
O Abu Waleed
Here are the human beings.
What's wrong, Abu Waleed? No, I'm calling you, not on the phone.
Go and finish your transaction.
And I won't worry.
You are not short, by God.
It seems that Dawood continued in his ways.
I will show you.
This is a big administrator.
Where does he go?
Yalla, Ouz, Pakistan.
My brother, which side, or Pakistan?
The third right office in Pakistan.
I don't cough.
Wait, Bofhed.
Do not sit.
I don't look at me.
And unless you want

Forward
Folks, the real is yen.
Do you know how much I love you, maybe it's been a while.
And over these many years, this is you.
Amoudi, you brought papers.
Get on, she fell.
Wander and stroll between these ministries.
But we were young.
Here is the translation of the text you provided: Here is the one I see in front of you, I am a piece of cloth, I put it on my shoulder like this, like a genie carrying a baby's plaster.
And may God protect you. God willing, you have learned to ride a bicycle.
Especially after the scale that I learned on and bought.
Very green, olive.
And they tease me for riding a bicycle, oh woe!
The bread of life and raising children.
The manager has arrived.
When it's finished, God willing, we'll have the sweetness.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Okay, here is the
I bear witness that you, Abu Sa'id, have not been remiss.
Now we want comfort, my brother, woe to us! With peace.
Here we are, quarantined.
Don't want anymore, I'll give you a year.
Stop stop
May God reward you with good.
You extended four years for me.
Otherwise, I should have retired long ago.
The kids, they all got to work.
The last one yesterday, the one who is absent.
He's back now, Abu Abdulaziz.
I am looking for comfort.
No, and your job is a reporter.
For a good snail.
Do you believe it, even?
I am four or five years old. I haven't tasted the khanfresh.
He is good.
I smell it in my nose.
Everything you command will happen, God willing.
Ask for the Human Resources Department.
You finished the papers.
What happened yesterday?
I'm taking this long with your transaction.
Dude, I'm bored.
That's it.
Don't cut us off again.
Hello, Uncle Khaled.
From this moment on, that's it.
God willing, we will rest, father, we will rest. Oh woe is us.
Sweet sweet
I am at work and cannot leave.
You can access the General Directorate of Human Resources.
I have a transaction there.
I want you to take her and take her to the civil service.
Thank you, thank you, oh father, you are not short.
Where are you going?
Okay, here's the tra
And our resolve, all of us.
Now
The bank is waiting for me.
Season it with someone.
I can't, I couldn't leave work.
Okay, okay, let's go, bye.
Looks like he didn't agree, right?
He says he can't get out.
What are you doing now?
Tomorrow morning, while I was coming by the bank.
Learned all these years, working.
He must be feeling the discomfort.
This is better for him.
You are making it difficult for him to rest.
Poor Farhan, he will return home.
He called me and told me that Khaled...
He sent him away to finish his transaction.
Fear Allah.
Everyone is on their own.
My mother regrets making the khanfresh.
It's good, mom, it won't break.
I'm not sorry for the khunfresh, oh mother.
But I say, since he left work and like this.
Khalid will go and find work for him.
Lying in his room.
Those who were lost at sea.
Good morning, Grandpa.
Welcome, my daughter.
Oh, and may He deliver you safely.
Just call me and tell me the manager is very angry.
Here are the
Hello Um Sa'id
I told you to let the kids depend on themselves, what's wrong with you, you're not listening to reason.
You were going to be lazy.
He has an obligation upon him.
Here I am, sitting and waiting for you, with the khanfresh (a type of fish) right in front of me.
Today we eat it.
Yalla, with salama.
Don't worry, Dad, if I forgot to tell you.
My dear, my love, my father.
May God help you.
Yes, the one who
Get out of here quickly!
Here is the translation
The name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Mashallah upon you.
I found the house.
Eels eels is.
I told you, stay home.
Teach your children how to manage themselves.
What should I do, happy day.
Their circumstances are difficult, I am forced to help them.
That's it, that's it, relax.
And I will bring you a bottle of water.
Here you are, I brought you the khunafrosh, you will eat it.
Dizzy poor man.
And from the taxis.
And upon him, upon his face.
The branch that is in the market.
They want the personal card.
After you have installed your car.
And show him the papers.
Thank God, my father, praise be to God.
And he relied on himself.
I killed you.
I want you to rest.
Greetings to you, our dear.
Enjoy your lunch, don't miss it.
Your papers from ministry to ministry, through government transactions.
Your addressee is the Ministry.
Behind the kids' transactions.
You pamper them, the elders, and you pamper them, the young ones. Truly, you are spoiling them.
The kids are holding good positions, important ones.
Their time is busy, what can we do?
Every day except for a meeting with the manager, or with, I mean, the senior responsible person, or with the minister.
I mean they have good jobs, after they need time to train them to do the work, oh the hardship.
Lost and trying to get your affairs in order, dealing with Turks, and looking for a second job, they mess you up, make you a sitting duck, what else?
May He guide you now, and may God reward you.
Here I am, with goodbye.
Oh God, forgive us then, oh Bushaheen.
Okay, they called me and told me it's done.
If you text your father tomorrow, he will finish the transaction for you.
That's why I will be very late.
Fear your Lord.
Tomorrow is impossible, tomorrow in particular I cannot.
From his love for you.
Here is the translation of the provided text: He is not bothered and is tired of you and your actions towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair on his head.
There is a fallen person in the room who has been there for two days.
From these streets, from these suns.
May God give you the treatment.
and go run and finish it for him
The committee came from morning until the end of the day.
My reputation, mother.
My building work will be delayed for a while.
As long as tomorrow is your last day and the committee.
Your transaction must be completed by tomorrow.
Otherwise, come at night to complain to me about them.
Tomorrow he has a committee he must negotiate with.
What's in Baba?
His tear fell into his eyes.
Originally, I wasn't lying to my parents.
The committee are the ones who changed their minds.
They said, "It will be finished by the end of the week."
Okay, tell your father.
Oh father, don't go.
I am going to heaven, and he is not.
I'm not sitting around loitering in this cafeteria with these bitches.
You are laughing at him.
Okay, that's it.
I will go apologize to him.
I go to him.
Thanked are you, father.
Immortality, oh father.
Thank him, he is wrong.
And it turned out he was selfish after all.
And don't tire yourself out, because the committee won't come. And don't tire yourself out, because the committee won't come.
You are the goodness and the blessing.
From this day on.
We handle our own business transactions.
This is in the house.
Here's your head, I'll kiss it.
Hello, hello, hello, father.
May God grant you goodness in the morning.
Oh, dearest father.
In the whole world.
Don't be sad, everything will be alright.
And I don't get annoyed.
And you too, just as I told you.
I have finished dealing with this transaction.
I wish to finish it myself.
And they told me, "Come quickly!"
You have a meeting.
With the pleasure of the Minister.
Make her happy, father, for just a moment.
They were led by those big people.
Oh, my joy, they said your son is with the, oh woe, this is it.
Trust in God, may your day be constant, may it be everlasting.
Bosayd, where are you?
And whoever hands you over, oh father.
The envelope in front of me, yes.
You are just a passerby, and I am sending you this envelope with the boy.
My love, my father.
He did not sign.
It seems he forgot.
Because the committee will meet in about an hour.
May God protect you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me just the transaction.
This is my situation, going from work to prayer and from home to work.
Where is there, not around anyone?
Peace be upon you
And upon you be peace, here you are, my dear, here you are.
No, no, no, I didn't kill him, I didn't kill him, nothing.
Which of the classified weeks goes to the wild?
And they tell you, "Oh,
He will go in the morning.
He's taking his ease there, of course.
And I will add to the rhyme. And I will add to the rhyme.
They say his cook doesn't need it.
And I will go to him.
Goodbye
May there be no evil.
God forbid there is something wrong, uncle.
God guide you, but.
No, Dad, I can't, I can't.
Your papers have been scattered.
That one is in the village.
This is from excess.
His friend's transaction.
Thirsty, oh father, I want water.
Oh my god
My dear sons
No, no, just cross it out, cross it out, I don't want it.
Do not write like this
He makes them confused.
Fayg, my sister.
And you are the truth/real deal.
He killed him.
By God, my sister.
Allow me, my sister.
What they call the league and the cup.
And he spoke about the rule.
I don't know what that boy is saying, he's confusing it, and he's bringing it up.
They caught him on it, just nonsense, and just nonsense.
The people have returned, their weight has been balanced.
They have a pretext for him and they tell him to talk on the radio and television.
And more than that.
Take him, grab him, oh my brothers, and throw him in prison.
Believe me, my sisters.
Oh, daughter of Halal, these days, no one is useful to anyone.
What's the use of problems?
By God, right now if I die...
I won't let him talk, and to his own admission, we've just wrecked things.
Praise be to God for his safety.
We were visited by a blessing.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, mom, this is how it is.
Listen, father.
I was up all night yesterday.
And I warn you.
Now I just wanted to remind you, father.
Okay, Mom.
It's impossible to call back.
No radio, no television, not even Qatel is connected.
Your sister Aisha, who lives in a residence, has been unwell for two days.
And Minire, your fiancée, her tears are four times four on her cheek.
May God have mercy on you, father, have mercy on us, and may whoever has mercy on their parents be shown mercy.
Like you said.
Enough nonsense.
I didn't want you to be annoyed.
Uncle Abu Amnirah, that's you.
Here we are, after they threw you in prison.
and said that's it / that's enough
Remove the veil (or, strip the veil).
Here is the translation of the provided Arabic text into English: "After an exaggeration, oh father, his gift fell with him, the time he had, he would seek refuge in Allah and God willing, nothing but good will happen."
The second time he grabs you by the hand and takes yo
Okay, Mom.
I will repent after I say it.
If you call on the radio or television, I won't blame anyone but yourself.
Get lost, you worthless piece of garbage.
Let me just go now.
Between you and me, that's all there is to this talk.
I am the manager, he told me.
We don't want it here.
This tomorrow will go and mess up about the administration.
And he makes things for us, just like that.
Okay, now what will the manager say to him?
Wow, he has a million excuses, and he'll come up with them.
Where should I go, then?
That's it, just finished.
I missed you.
Yes.
Goodbye
I killed you.
It means, you know, Saleh, why did I kill you?
The public interest forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
Your speech is correct, but
And whoever hands you over, just one of us, that's nonsense.
sweet of you
Enough nonsense.
Yes.
You are still here.
We have work, please.
What a calamity, father.
I will handle matters.
Here, I struggled for you, I about salawh.
We didn't tell them to stop.
And Minyra was standing and listening the day I told you.
I told him, yes.
I can hear them in my ears, oh my, from Melos.
My soul, now you are inside.
And let me deal with your father.
We showered in prison, thinking it was a mistake, and we remained silent.
We are silent now, later, after they fired him.
Just because we are people.
Did you know how
Seek refuge in Satan.
God willing, only good things will happen.
Mention God, God guides you.
I don't want to have coffee, keep your coffee for yourself.
I know.
Bored
Uncle is giving you two weeks as a grace period.
I swear to God, if you try to lay a hand on me, I'll take you to court so I can be released.
يمه انا حتى لو طلعت
What's your problem with the calamities?
Just bear the burden on yourself.
Even if someone tells you
Pretend you don't hear him.
This is not our place, just nonsense.
Yes, man, is it.
But he hasn't punished me the past couple of days.
What's wrong, we don't want nonsense, my brother, we wish to hear it from you just once, just once.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: No, that's it.
To be your own police.
No, Mom, you misunderstand.
And my cousin has a problem, so we asked him to speak tomorrow on the radio.
He was a little hesitant.
We felt that we had contacted him in a public place, so he hesitated.
I said, "My cousin's son has a right to the house. I will speak to him privately about this."
So you felt that he wanted to say something.
He is hesitant, and this, and this, and this.
They came from somewhere they came.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, as requested: Just Just Just Just Just Just
I am not your mother, and I do not know you. I will disown you until the Day of Judgment. Understood?
Saleh Saad
Don't thank God for keeping you safe, this is finally over, ugh, let's get rid of her, thank God.
You have a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee
But unfortunately
Despite my attempts.
Assalamu Alaikum
Why did you bother yourself and come?
I just finished grilling. I was about to call the secretary to inform them that you will not be arriving.
What's wrong, Shaheen?
You didn't know about this.
Oh my, does anyone in Qatar not know Saleh? This is nonsense.
You are good, not with nonsense.
Enough with the nonsense.
Which job?
But there are no jobs, meaning you have to adapt to the circumstances.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Zain, oh Real, you didn't employ him?
I am the one who will take care of it for us.
I didn't leave a single place, I swear, oh Manal, I didn't go.
Even if someone tells me before I arrive, five minutes early, that I was in a job, but they paid it, meaning it was gone.
My sister Aisha was divorced yesterday by her husband.
It means my responsibility has grown so much.
After one became their responsibility to this extent.
I swear I don't know what to do, I swear.
He is getting closer to the minister.
But I honestly found it not very fair.
He thinks I'm afraid he'll replace me.
That's enough, you're killing me.
Who told you I will be quiet?
But I just want it to happen this way, away from me.
I'm thinking of a way to slaughter him.
You end it once.
What is it?
I know him.
This is not what is spoken on the radio.
I'll bring you the news.
And you are just a piece of information.
You, Salih, are a citizen filled with a spirit of national pride.
You are a passionate citizen.
Thank you
I left, I swear, that's it.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I, oh Bofhad, after speaking with him for a while...
I believe you, O Salah.
Someone says they haven't heard it in a long time, that's what they're saying, nonsense.
My mind wants to get to know him.
This is a normal thing, Saleh.
I am a fighter in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward!
And people like you are few.
Your speech is very beautiful.
And your words on the radio are much nicer.
We heard only one thing, just nonsense.
Of course, the translation of the provided text is as follows: Yes, come on, that's it, just one more to go, because there's plenty for you now, he's saying it, he's saying it, you hear him, you hear him, you hear him, you hear him.
But nonsense.
This is the original, may your age be long. This is it.
I asked you to continue, not to stop.
Harder slightly
Then he stopped, no more.
Maan, I wish it could continue because of people's problems and their issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I will give you only one problem.
O Salih, the voice of truth.
Pull yourself together, just a little more.
A high-ranking official, this is.
Repeat it, my brother, tell him to do it, he will do it, I swear.
By God's.
This is your chance.
And the opportunity does not come twice.
No, no, it means no.
What's wrong with you, you don't understand.
Be patient, please, my brother.
From the problems, the troubles, and the high-ups.
O' Your Excellency the Minister!
The ministry in its latest project has ordered eight thousand amphubub.
A compressed load has a capacity of one hundred twenty cubic centimeters.
But this employee
Agreed to pipes of capacity.
To benefit from the price difference.
Enough with the nonsense.
You did well, you did well, oh brother Saleh, we are tired of this nonsense.
God bless you.
This is a special order call.
God willing, you will name him Yes.
اخر بسنا خرابيط بسنا خرابائط
Do you know?
Life is what it does.
Just this last one, and that's it.
Sultan Asadullah flew.
With this speed, the minister carried it.
They say he said something true.
Now that the scene has cleared for Bu Fahd, he will play on his own.
I am able to handle all tasks.
May your age be long.
The bearer of this message is the Wazir.
Goodbye
Enough with the nonsense.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided
Oh, and here are my papers, as long as you are, my job papers, with forgiveness, it is a joke.
It means that those whom they wanted have reached their goal.
Listen to me
Because he is afraid.
Talk about him and reveal his scandals and troubles.
You expose the flaws and criticize.
They are afraid of you.
Deceive me, my sister Aasha.
You are the kind one.
Here is the translation of the provided text: Tomorrow my uncle Abu Amnirah.
Condition applied.
They have no story, those who criticize and find faults.
Why do they hold resentment towards our country?
Do we have flaws?
We don't have connections.
This is the first time I've heard the word "wasta."
At our government offices, you go in order.
We don't have bribery.
And it was not known.
And look at the employee.
Do we have a situation where a foreigner takes more than a local? No, absolutely not.
We do everything with our own hands.
You are a boy, your mother from [Father's origin], we have no master.
A supervisor will be upset with you, and you are still on the job.
We are the best people.
Best country
Flawless
And thank you.
Listen carefully yesterday on the radio.
Yum, I want candy.
I killed you, there's no sweetness except after dinner.
That's it then, no more sweets.
What happened to the shirt?
Yum, Adul and I were sitting and playing.
I know you play.
What's torn the shirt?
May God punish you, oh false witness.
Come, come look what your brother's son did.
What I told you, there's no need to buy it, it's too expensive. What I told you, it's okay, it's for the child, it will come out nice.
Look what he did.
Canceling this, this canceling shirt here, this doesn't work for buttons.
He said, "I'll do what I want with it. Of course, no one wants it."
Yum, where's the sweetness?
Look at the crack in the foundation, intentionally there, a hole within a hole.
He returned, and upon him was a child.
I am happy with it, it is the first time he wears it.
The bar where I am.
Where is the justice?
In the garden
Why do I become
I want it regarding a matter between us.
I don't understand it.
Amazing on your face.
Watch yourself and watch the people.
And they won't let him do as he pleases.
Rakes corruption.
Come, get disciplined.
Come, teach me.
We will take care of them.
About excessive mistakes and respect yourself.
Let him come near you.
You are fighting like children.
A distant bay, oh my.
Oh my, don't interfere, you at all.
Tell him to raise his children properly, listen, you and him.
Hey, this is it.
Cursed be you, bewitched, not letting you separate between the young and the old.
But I knew.
The blame is on me, not on you.
Let's go up.
These people do not deserve one.
Even if I answer them.
It is better for a person
Time of the tranquil hearts.
Okay, okay, okay, here we go, here we go, here we go, goodbye, goodbye.
Just a few words, your excellency, the minister is requesting the papers, and it is necessary for me to sign them.
That's it, that's it. I'll sort things out with the minister later. That's it, you have no further concern. I'll sort it out with him.
The calamity dried up, the disaster dried up, the catastrophe dried up.
His new hand-woven dress, oh Aisha!
This, this is not an action, oh people.
You are the pancake.
No translation provided.
Goofy Goofy
It means there is no hope of you wearing it.
Gofi wears short, meaning he wears a single short piece and goes out.
No, no, this is actually this is not a hand that breaks.
I'll tell you to get inside a hell of a chainsaw.
But I can only say حسبي الله على اللي سواها which translates to "God is sufficient for me against those who did this."
I am telling you.
Which of you wants candy? Come!
I also know.
If you still don't know, come on, take a lap around the villa.
I not only love you because you know how to ride a bicycle.
I love you because something else is in you.
You are telling the truth, right?
Okay, here is the t
My dad, two.
I will give you four units.
Whoever cut up our clothes in the closet.
Here is your father, how did he cut them?
He has a bigger scissors so he can cut the car with it.
Under the bed, here is all the sweetness.
It will never reach such depths.
Nobody else but him created this calamity.
Why do we keep silent about it?
The most important thing
That we insist on our words.
From worn clothes, a boy is born.
Any computer
Why is he sitting and talking like this?
The breaking that I saw with my own eyes, it's impossible for anyone to do it.
Why don't you want to believe me?
Go find your quarter, go.
Give me just a moment.
This is your situation.
Every day, oh mom, you two are fighting.
Where are you, oh time of the first?
Oh God, grant us forgiveness and good health.
Oh God, guide you.
He can carry scissors this big.
You are the one I seek among your people.
Look at the rags over there.
I'm going to get scissors, how big?
Respect yourself, Sultan, respect yourself, Awoosh.
Come, father, and whoever has mercy on your parents, find a solution for them. Come, father.
How do I start?
and each one of you
You are fathers.
The child is born.
The child is born.
You are my brothers.
Listen to my words and reconcile, extend your hands.
Okay, tell me what you're going to do now.
Well, bird, I have torn their garments.
What did they do with their clothes when this calamity they caused me took away my entire files, information, documents, and the whole world?
By God, I will not let him go.
Bring us something like a museum piece about the Arabic language, I swear I won't let it go.
Never mind him.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
My brother is not sober, and I know him.
And each one greeted the other.
This is not his true heart, my father. This is a heart filled with bitterness and hatred.
Here he is furious because I broke the computer.
Weh Fahd
His Highness, grant him grant him grant him.
Just be afraid of your Lord, oh mother.
Give it, turn, be careful, be careful.
Take your grandfather, your cousins, and go play outside.
Oh God, oh God, I hope God will grant you reconciliation.
May God bless you.
Men, each one of different length, height.
What have you left for the children?
God willing, oh mother.
Their brother is Abdulrahman.
Can, oh mom, the first time.
Do you know, oh mother, here is the stick/reed.
Can he talk to people?
And he understands them.
You too, don't be upset with me.
You are supposed to be from you.
Each one has a role.
May God grant you reform, but may God grant you reform.
Even you, my father, have become like them.
Oh my, my, my, expel my son! Oh, master, we are commanded by God to guide you. And you, you say "my ex, my ex, my ex"
and yes, my dear
May my son's blood be the last to be shed.
You have failed us, you little kids.
Those who were deleted, were these these.
He's not willing to believe.
I know them with both my eyes.
We will tell him, but he will not believe this.
He says from above.
Here it is, the translation: Here it is, the translation: **Through the dust,

Here you are, you can go.
You might be a little tired, or your head is spinning.
You know who these people are.
You're telling me that Yarin, who picks at you, is...
This appears
My love.
I'll tell you to go and rest now. They've signed a pledge, that's it. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
What is this? Come on, come on.
Allah is sufficient for me against the enemy.
يمه يمه
It's all your fault.
It's your fault.
The biggest but the smallest, I have no use for you and your minds.
They took me to the hospital, I faint, I die.
Any dryness, and it's not the first time I've seen it.
And the observation after is that he does not lower his eyes from you, oh Hazee.
Here's the translation of the provided text: Here's what wasn't recorded in the business with us.
But now it has been a week that it attends with us the material.
It is very clear that he will die and get to know you.
Don't get heavy if you don't have to.
Don't, my sister.
He won't say I'm cutting off my own self for him.
She abandoned me, a child of high standing, and turned her back on me.
Let things happen naturally, it's better.
Now he's the one chasing you and the one dedicating his life to you.
I mean, yes, I would reciprocate the same feelings of admiration.
But I don't know, I still feel that the right opportunity hasn't come yet.
The same way, the same way.
I tore it up and looked at you, Ji and Mai, how.
And you wait, young man, for it to come and tell you, "Please, I want to get to know you."
Brother, be the one to take the initiative.
Your speech is correct.
But I am waiting for the right opportunity.
The suitable opportunity
More than being registered with her for the same course.
The teacher said so.
Say it, O woman.
Oh so-and-so, why don't you come here, is it really what it seems?
We have been waiting for three months, staring into your eyes.
And no one knows the other.
Oh, my brother, you are not from the old days.
It means I have to go and tell her, please.
May I get to know you.
No more empty talk, speak strongly.
I have to wait for the right opportunity to come to me.
This one is nice and polite.
I really don't know what you want exactly.
We finished filming the series yesterday.
By God's.
You have never forgotten us, and you have not been deficient for us.
I am now free.
That we buy the villa that's behind us, this is Walid's right.
Will be tomorrow, God willing. If he marries, we will be taken. We are not far from us.
What's the use now?
I am very, very sorry.
And you are good news.
Here, from time to time, I pass by her gate. Oh, how I long for her, free from her evils.
They bought the land through the Development Bank.
May God bless them, God willing, it will be good.
Hello, hello father, good morning.
Here, man, start the engine.
Thank you, father. Thank you. May God reward you. May God reward you with goodness.
Hello, hello, Noura, you're welcome, you're welcome, good job, the car is running, great, come here, I'll take you, come here, come here, father.
And peace be upon you.
What is it you have?
Neighbors, sitting and talking to each other, what's your business between them?
I say get out of here, it's better for you.
Neighbors, sitting together, what's your business between them?
I am in a sticky situation with my car and I can't get it out.
After your permission, after your permission, give me the key to your car.
After you wash the car.
I'll leave you in the Titanic atmosphere that you're living in.
Goodbye
Goodbye
Now you have known many things about me.
And I only knew Walid.
Waleed Rashid Abdullah
Definitely a lot of people. If you tell them your father's name, they will think you are the son of the actor.
Mashallah, the same name.
Originally, my father Rashid Abdullah was an actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the respected actor, your father.
Why didn't you have dinner with them? Did anyone have dinner in these pampas?
Come and tell me.
How did you know the famous actor Rashed Abdullah, Yara?
Yes, yes, that's correct.
Hey my friend at university, they know them, and she's the one who told me.
Here he loves and loves his acting, and he only follows him, here.
He told me, "We no longer live next to a famous person who has value in society."
Ah, my heart, my joy.
What a nice person, what a nice person, he has a light heart, yes indeed.
Or, his son turned out to be like him. After he startled me, God reward him well.
Truth be told
Did you return?
I have to film with him this actor that I love, you will see why.
يمه هاج كلمي عبود ولد خالتي
Here is the translation of the provided text: **"Back then, I read an interview with him in the newspaper."**
He says they are filming a series about the days of pearl diving.
I say, who led, oh I will bring you a sheep for the occasion of the new hand.
He has proven that he is indeed a good neighbor.
Halaa Saleh, ha fee shee yadeed.
We have many names.
They told me, "May God keep you safe from the group, Abu Saad. My name is on the list."
And it is determined according to the need and the employee's expertise.
We don't know.
We might not move you.
Allow me, I can't do anything for you.
May God protect you from your enemy.
We said to move and sit down before then, and if God provides for us later, then we will have children.
Improve your work.
He returned, oh Abu Ali.
Please do not consider me, I am a stranger.
Anything you need.
I am at your service.
Neighbor to neighbor, and I am your brother.
That's all I've heard and seen.
Zain, mashallah upon you. You know about furniture.
Kid, I'm going and you come.
You don't have to, sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, tell me.
My love, your father is applying for a loan, and if approved, he will buy all the furniture.
Here I am repeating it for a second time.
What Airedj Is, Is Only The Tongue.
We are today, indeed, a people.
This one, you don't even know how to study on your own.
But I just wanted her to be self-reliant.
I was definitely talking to her.
It means I'm going to tell you a lie and say I'm talking to my friend.
Oh my mother, oh Ali.
I am not for anything.
If she loves me and I love her, I will understand her.
You are dreaming.
Let me arrange a marriage proposal for you with your cousin.
Leave the topic as it is.
As you wish.
Your end, your defeat.
We see.
Good night
And you are from his family.
Good
Dude, this car is making a horn.
Every other day, you make up a story for me.
The girl returned, may God protect you, she has a university.
And this one is always sacrificing.
Your daughter is our daughter.
It's alright.
There is no need for you to burden yourself, oh brother oh Rashid.
May God protect you.
The car is parked in the driveway, and the driver is sitting without the engine running.
The hollow bank of development has not spared you; your home and car are yours.
This is not our car.
Car of the neighbor house of Rashid Abdullah.
The hollow relationships evolved.
We discuss matters of mutual interest that are beneficial to both parties.
Ooh, amazing development, Hazi!
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Let's go.
It's embarrassing, mom.
I couldn't
Noura said, "I thought my daughter, and every day the driver would take her to university."
To have told her that my dad's car will take a week to fix.
No, by God, no.
She said no, never mind the driver, he will pick her up every morning.
I swear to God, Yam Ali.
Good people
Lalala, يابوك
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Oh my God, oh my God, what can I do now?
What responsibilities do I have?
My daughter, who is taking her to university?
يابo Ali, as long as your recommendation is Professor Rashid Abdullah, then...
We can't say anything, that's it.
Bossaeed, Bossaeed.
Bosaaad, I am sorry.
BoAli knows his value to us.
Thank you, may God reward you with goodness, you haven't fallen short, oh bosسعد.
They all love you, mashallah.
God, she is beautiful, just like her.
He's back, folks. Professor Rashid is busy; let him be.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry Mr. Rashid, we made you wait or something.
At your service, ready, ready.
Who are you to have a strong connection?
Here are a few possible translations, depending on the nuance you want to convey.
Just tell me where you want it, and I will bring it to you.
What's happening to me? Why are you bothering me?
Will you marry me, Manal?
They agreed, oh mother, they agreed.
Manal spoke to her mother about me.
What's wrong, you're not believing it?
This appears
And dresses, do you have a party?
I didn't understand.
The fowl is indeed Waleed's, God willing, the sight of my eye.
He returned, and I spoke to him, poor thing.
Taking accessories.
What's the deal with accessories, jewelry?
This is my mother.
Now you will install a fancy car.
Mashallah, mashallah.
Mashallah, I couldn't find the words.
Umm Walid, I haven't started interacting with you.
For all that I gave you, I still haven't given you the car.
And with her is the driver.
Here, if I go with you, this color won't be believed, that this pale and fat one, the husband of this queen.
Ummbai way
God willing, you will go in clothes like these.
No, no, no, no, no, oof, you're welcome.
I change my clothes, I'll let you keep me in the dark.
They are saying, "Oh, from this sheikh who has intruded upon us."
Make a long-lived coffee.
Boo Ali, I didn't recognize you, I swear. I thought this was definitely someone from the nightclubs, coming to me, not Boo Ali. You're not Boo Ali.
What do you think?
And the walk is different after.
May God keep you, those two who we go to propose to, for Ali, they have...
Elderly people.
I took care of myself, no longer constrained by the mind or the car.
I said, "For sure I'll get it from you."
The last series I acted in.
In a scene that was a wedding, I remember which wedding.
I was wearing that black, shining bashta.
And after your father, he taught me how to wear the bisht.
Because your brother, God keep you safe, never wore a bisht.
Mashallah, you are glowing.
This is how it would be if I went to the classroom to address the group.
That's not fair anymore.
I'm telling you, my brother Rashid.
You don't have any more buttons.
The best
The one I always find with me, along with Khaloud.
The story is like this, meaning...
You are my love.
We are now family.
We don't want our daughter Noura to go far.
Noura is right for Walid.
Youli, mom, I see her at the university, and I don't find anyone better than her.
This is a blessed hour.
God willing, I will tell the truth to her father, and God writes what is in good.
Why was it rejected, what was the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Go get your father.
Tell Rashid quickly that he wants you.
Where are you,
Cry out from oppression.
Do you say it's because his father is an actor?
Do you not feel ashamed on your faces?
I am an actor.
But I represent with honor.
I act on stage for two hours, and my role ends.
And my representation ends.
You play roles.
I represent
I offer them a message that will benefit them.
As for you
I wear clothes for acting.
On the stage.
As for you
You represented it in the milasses.
The rich
Who is the actor playing Vena?
Who is the real actor?
Do not be sad, Walid.
Look up.
We are not honored.
As for what you missed, now look! While I was coming.
Listen to her screaming at him. Don't look back. Don't look back. Poor thing, it breaks the heart.
and his master walks
You say a horse's paradise.
It's Thursday, man.
This is Thursday.
His wife will not wake him.
She is jealous of him.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he does not see the women, and the women do not see him.
I saw how his wife was, a true lady.
Do not look back.
But tomorrow I won't show him in the office.
Khamees, please, please, show them how he wears his suit.
Khamis Farjani showed me his grandma's clothes.
Weren't you correct in identifying her as your wife, wearing the traditional dress?
Yalla, it's Thursday.
I go as a hollow-eyed, old man.
Poor, my brother.
How long will you stay like this?
If you listen to the talk that is said behind your back.
No, mashallah, even in front of me, they say it could be even more later.
Why would I do that?
Do you get jealous over me?
Do you get jealous of what?
Sometimes I sit in front of the television.
This is it, here it is.
By God, I swear.
No worries
Peace be upon you, my sister.
The water has dried up now.
It was as if I was truly standing before you, speaking to you, and hearing the voice of a man.
By God, sometimes I tear my clothes, so, so, on the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
It's difficult to let go.
There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
Do not approach me, do not approach me. Stay away.
What's wrong with you?
My intention is good.
You are arguing from what?
No one is messing you up except for these types you sit with.
And especially, this one, I, this one among all your friends, I don't like from the way of living, oh, this fat, plump one.
With the eyebrows that are like a plant, just recently sprouted.
The glorious one with life who doesn't shy.
Do you want to make me suffer in my grave?
Let me sort things out with her.
After, what do you have to say?
Understands with whom
I'm not seeing anyone here.
What's wrong with you? What's happening?
Our friend's son.
He barely watches the swimming and keeps talking to himself.
No, I am saying the limp in his head is making a "natting" sound, floating above.
This is a normal Thursday, this poor man.
Everything seems normal to him, as if his mother is in front of him, and he is talking to her.
Allah is sufficient for me regarding his wife.
They are saying "Have a Thursday (خميس) with them."
Now he is busy, he has an international call to a very distant place, even the line cuts off.
What's wrong with this message?
I say, may God help you, oh Khamees.
What's wrong, you're not sleeping?
I don't have a node, I swear I don't know, maybe you're coming to me.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow.
With the female delegation that is in the ministry.
It could mean
May God guide you, but O Khamees.
These names come from the office of His Excellency the Minister.
And then come.
Why are you so afraid of her?
If I were arguing with Salem, I wouldn't be afraid.
Say the truth
Why are we hiding and adapting behind the water tank?
That's it.
The provided text appears to be a sequence of numbers and potentially some
The last number, ha.
The last number you called after you erased the number of the woman you used to talk to.
Tell me what it's called, father of women.
fight fight fight
I killed her with Salim's riddles.
Salom, my friend, in the F, F, F,
I didn't believe you, my brother.
And what are you wearing?
I intend to dive.
I swear, my sister wouldn't let me wear anything. She told me to go out like this.
Call F man
Call my wife's father.
My wife's husband
Say it, brother, get the pen, I'll give you the number.
Care for one another.
This is your nature, you men.
You are a liar, just like him, but I will show you.
If I interfere again, there will be nothing but the Minister's office for me.
This is an abbreviation.
And he threatened me, saying that if I complain about him in the Minister's office,
This is really bold.
This one is planning to cut my livelihood, truly.
But I am the one at fault, the one who listened to you and called her.
Jawf, back, oh Khamees.
If you complain about me in the Minister's office.
Come with me there and tell them the whole story. They left me out of it, oh well.
It's none of my business.
You are a coward.
My brothers and sisters
May my morning greet you all.
I would be honored by your presence at this meeting.
Where are the rest of them then?
Get lost.
Where is he on Thursday?
Great, your age!
Phone sugar
Okay, don't get drunk, leave it in the office.
The whole meeting is one hour.
Here is a translation of the input text: This is from my phone.
It became and it was established, it became.
I'm worried about that day, you've had them staying with you and they haven't gone home.
Where does he go?
He cannot go.
From Zach today, he is sitting in the same state.
Jealous, jealous for him, you are jealous.
My love, this is not an accusation.
He sits here in the living room at night, and I will go.
Tell me, should I talk to my mother?
Mother, mother, she is dead.
That's why I'm asking you to see if you can find a solution.
Madame A asked you to move from the section where you are women.
Damn, it's military rule, isn't it?
Aka Jinny's signature is very big, read below.
My brother, please I am being transferred to the Social Welfare Department.
are you sure they transferred you to the care department
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God protect you.
You are the sister, sorry, brother Khamees.
They called us, the office of the minister, and informed us.
Here, I have arrived at your new department.
And who is with you, your colleagues in the office?
Isa, Saleh, Jassim, and... **Translation:** Isa, Saleh, Jassim, **and...**
Oh, Thursday yesterday, the minister decided to transfer you.
And today, you are appointed to your new department.
And I explained to you, I told you, my problem is with the family.
You are a trans person by the decision of the minister.
I mean, I'd go to the minister.
He took a day off for his annual leave.
And he won't be back until a month and a half.
This is a mess.
And you want my opinion as well.
The minister, same talk.
Keep going until we find a place for you because this time I am transferring you because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I am telling you the truth.
The provided
If a woman calls me, I won't argue.
Do you know, maybe they will keep up with you, you are the one begging them.
I let them put the toy in the car. I put them in a box.
jam wahda
I put ten on it, thinking you were five in the office, meaning each one on two.
Here's the translation of the provided text, without any additional explanations: **"Yes, and its appearance after, I will die from my wife, I am afraid of her."**
Imagine if all of us were given male names.
And I am called Abdulghader.
This is what he's called, that's why.
He is handsome, sweet, I mean, so I would be afraid for him in that way.
What's wrong with her?
You said to call me.
Ahmed Abdel Qader, who is sitting next to Hassan, who is over there, is sitting behind Khalil.
Here are the games. Each person chooses what they want.
Gawfi, this is
Your joy is deaf.
What's wrong with you, acting like this?
لو سمحت
Where is the care home office?
Presumably five female employees.
What is your name?
I am beautiful.
I am Minon, I am the one who is my wife.
I am Minion
You are now facing the project in front of us.
And we met with them.
Okay, what did they say to you?
They said.
You light up, come join us, you're welcome here.
I cannot
I want to go into the kitchen and get messy.
Come on, come on, come on, go do what's coming, come on.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, what a load of nonsense.
Come on, come on, listen to the men, listen to them.
Oh God, haven't you forgotten that we are the Banu Uqurib?
Oh God, oh God, and I am coming without any thanks, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.
The bank said that the project has no delays.
Call him, his phone is all busy.
Poor, they have been waiting for you since early morning.
And I, what do I have to do with a problem, other than this uncle and these brothers?
A maid traveled on the basis of a month, and now it has been three months.
God, Raeem, Yalla, with salama.
And all the modifications, my uncle, all of them are in our favor.
The boy of us
By the way, if you create the garden.
At least he will go somewhere, at least two or three houses.
They say that the park is considered a breath of fresh air for people who will live in this complex, which is the bank.
Men are sitting and discussing; they do not need the opinion of women.
Let the opinion be for you.
Did you put the next thing we found? Show me!
Gardena la
One minute.
My sister, you know that I love football.
Amj and the brothers, they don't know that you play football at school. If they knew, they would kill you.
What do you know about yourself?
She said to him/her.
I say forget the subject, it's better for you.
And don't you look at yourself.
No, I have something on my mind regarding you.
What can I tell you, the world is full of worries.
You are our blessing.
Oh, Uncle Shaheen is here.
What God has willed.
This is Thursday.
Length and Width
The turning of the dishdasha.
I wanted while searching for a female for him, but I couldn't find one.
Origin and essence.
I'll tell you something.
My Thursday wedding.
This is from the Resource Management Department.
Yes, long may your life be.
Leave it on the side.
She has some comments on the proposal.
May your command be long, may your life be long.
Do you have anything else?
May your life be long.
Pay attention to them, and if I get the chance, God willing, I will meet them.
What did you do to the female employees that I sent for you?
May good things happen.
I'm going now, and then I'll call you.
What's happening?
Who are you?
We are your daughters, bigger than you.
We have been struggling
You know, ask Fatoum what she plays sports at school.
Killed them, tennis, table.
Good, they didn't slaughter her though.
This appetizer is what you get when you turn this (referring to something physical) around.
You don't know who we are.
What is our origin?
Do you know what stingers are?
This time we messing up your face.
The great Scorpion
The minute hand
Let's give her a slap on the face.
Enough of what she has.
You keep yourself as a reserve for later.
My jealousy, you didn't say you would enter civil engineering like me.
You are welcome.
Scorpions don't have female children working on the streets between men.
Engineering, architecture, and finding.
Where can I take her, where between the scorpions, where?
Let me break her head.
No, no, Sultan, no.
Currently, you are an old scorpion.
You are broken, Fatoum.
Let your brother, Falcon, take his chance.
By God, it is a shame what they are doing.
My dear, my dear, at least you are enough.
Gawfi Wayhi Ana
Okay, what's the point? You'll be calling tomorrow morning.
What are they doing?
Look, O eagle, descend!
Let's go, ahead of me, ahead of me.
Where should I go?
Not a word.
Where are you going?
We told Gab to not say a word.
And you write instead of it, "bringing up".
Even if you work, if it becomes clear that we have no objection,
What do you want after?
You have two options.
To show that we are a democracy.
You're saying you put pressure on us.
either pampering or bringing up
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Let's go, hurry up.
Bring us a copy of the application.
Go away, go away quickly.
The biggest scorpions, oh father.
The thorny stem, by itself, approached you.
You haven't been briefed, my dear, but when will the shelter be established, God willing?
Professor Amneh
What you are asking for, I see it as very difficult.
I couldn't travel, Abu Khalid.
I have special circumstances.
The minister was very specific about it.
Very difficult.
My mind is sound, O Princess.
Do not make a decision immediately; think about it, don't just decide tomorrow.
How did you get the women to work?
For that reason, we are silent.
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you.
We don't have girls who travel.
Turkish person, get out of this mess.
Neither living nor shameful.
Who amongst us is making him work still now?
Tomorrow you will go and apologize.
Do not hesitate.
My hearing, when you are silent.
A Thursday from the children of the scorpions.
From us and for us.
Right, he's an idiot and has no degree.
Just a scorpion.
My sister, what are you going to do now?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
What can I do?
There is nothing in his power.
What does she do?
Next Thursday, God willing, the school.
We will call you and tell you what time it is for us, depending on the difference of the sheikh who will perform the marriage.
Oh, how sweet this laugh is.
Go get yourself some clothes.
Go get yourself some clothes, father.
You're killing me with this laughter.
My brother begged you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Make us some jay (beer), coffee, and cake.
Who is this now, Aisha? Who is this, the Minister's friend?
I'm afraid it might be an rumor, Abu Khalid.
Amnīrah is nominated to hold a ministry among the ministries in the new ministerial formation.
Amnirrah deserves it.
God willing, it won't be a rumor.
You are to report to work tomorrow.
And we all cooperate to serve the nation.
Through each one of our contributions, in our respective positions. Thank you.
I wish all of us success.
Thank you, the minister's messenger.
Thank you very much for the hot flour, the hardworking minister.
Thank you.
May her life be long, she is lovely, she is lovely.
Peace be upon you
Wash with soap, just as I instructed you.
This is the female national team's football team's general supervisor.
Ask him how your sister Fatima played.
In the name of God, God has willed it, and God is Great.
Captain Fatima Qabat Qunain Ala Tariqati Al-Kibar
Captain Fatima is talented, oh our brothers. Goodbye, my son.
Captain, what do you think of my sister's playing? What position does she play?
That's all, head of the war.
You travel to China.
Captain Janah is far away, a little way from China.
May God grant you success.
Your sister is playing an important match.
This was a person who studied education, but today I went and transferred her papers.
I let her study a marsh with its reeds.
Captain, because there's no difference between a real and a fake one.
By God, pour the coffee, just pour it.
Where are you going?
I wanted and I was waiting.
You are a donkey, you are a donkey.
Yalla yalla, go and tell your mother, "They kicked me out!"
Oh God, oh God, your father, your mother's father.
By God, it's a situation.
The pot you have has cooled down.
All year they didn't know about you. I found out, and as soon as they hear that you have work...
How are you? How are the children?
I missed her.
I will kill her, God willing, this time you will be with us in the series.
Of course, and it plays the role of the hero.
Got, oh Ali, look for novel, no one plays it except for Shoola.
My love, there's something called makeup that can make them smaller.
Mary, twenty-six or twenty-seven, an episode.
Let Sha'wala benefit my father.
He sits and gives us lectures, neither the first nor the last.
I am afraid that a bone will get stuck in the throat.
The most important thing is that no one knows that the company providing the series is your company, and Hamid's company.
God willing, I haven't been delayed, my brothers.
And he is mature and has wisdom after.
The director is ready
Okay everyone, just because of the time, let's start the meeting.
Let those who wish to speak express their opinion, they are welcome.
Ganak Hamed, do you want to say something?
To be honest, I don't think there's a better series than this one.
Come, you on this day found, on this day this maid committed suicide.
And you know the scene that affected me the most?
The maid's day, she commits suicide.
On the day her soul was hung, the bank, the bank, it wandered, it wandered, it wandered, it wandered, and the blood flowed, flowed, flowed, flowed down from her neck.
They found him, and she started screaming at her son, I swear, it was an action.
And he sits shooting at it, shooting at it, shooting at it until he reaches the courtyard of their house.
The height of action.
Yes, the police are searching and seizing everyone.
Honestly, the series is extremely wonderful.
The following are different ways of expressing
This is an artistic moral violation.
And the rape of society's values.
A series based on events involving abnormalities.
Unbelievable
Seventy-two cases of murder.
What's going on? This shouting?
You are already known to not want anyone to interfere.
Let us, let us, oh Mr. Hamed, let us be democratic.
We will settle the issue by majority vote.
O my brother Nasser, I will not hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy and majority.
You are implicated by virtue of your government position in this matter.
Goodbye
I'll tell you, I heard the bell sound.
And when it rose, there was no Indian with a rifle in his hand.
When he asks me, I tell him, "Yes."
I opened the bag.
I think there's a ring, I believe that's its value, worth around seventy, eighty thousand.
I'm afraid this Indian brought these things to us by mistake.
No, Dad, it's not a mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the responsible person we have at the company.
Here is the translation of the
What's wrong with you?
The ring is very luxurious.
I have never dreamed of having a ring that is the same.
Appropriate, may God protect you, oh Hessa, my beloved.
This is my father, this series. I call it a series of goodness.
Ali and Hamid, they are the employers, but because they are our employees, it cannot be that they submit the series in their name, so they submit it in whose name?
What else is there after this ring?
I'll tell you, but the words won't come out. It will be between me and you.
What's the matter, Minona? I'm saying it to someone's face.
Your witty husband
They call him the magician.
What's up, five percent? Not much.
No, my dear, they are beautiful if they agree to four million.
My husband gets two hundred thousand sweet Ariyal.
I say, let's cast the role of the university student for Nada.
Where's the good door? You meet someone and abandon them on a motorcycle.
Our series that we are working on, its title is "Rape of Conscience."
They called me about a role in a series.
Okay, here is the trans
Always this form, our Gulf series, meaning just as we say the trend, this year, rape.
What is my role going to be, my love?
And you too, my love. Your role is a hundred percent guaranteed.
Relieved to avoid embarrassment.
Kanny yai yai al-yeen
My love has returned, I made it for you all this sweet breakfast, are you going to leave me after all this?
This is Omar, the secretary of the manager.
God save us.
He's never asked me at this time.
And he said to him, "This series that they are going to make is weak and trivial."
It's a shame to waste money on it.
Okay, and then my point, what happened?
God willing, I'll go tell them, meaning, are you afraid that Rashid and this fool have told them something bad about the series?
Don't be afraid, you.
Let this topic be on me.
sick person
A social series.
This is what I saw just a few days ago on TV.
May your age be long.
The series currently airing is titled "Rape" and the story revolves around a flower whose petals have not yet fully unfurled.
But it seems that the budget they are asking for is an extremely large amount.
It needs a larger budget.
Then, don't forget God to keep you safe. The institution that produces the work is a local institution.
God bless you, I ask with her hands.
Rest assured, may your age be long.
I read the technical page.
We hear these days about the start of filming a series about the rape of conscience.
And a huge budget has been allocated for him.
It is said that the series is not up to the required level.
And another says the series is just a school for deviance.
It is more likely that they will stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Hello, Abdul Hamid.
Hello, hello, by God, welcome, welcome, sit down and rest.
Good morning
Good morning, oh welcome.
I am the journalist Elie Mounir, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, please.
Okay, just rest for a bit because he has a meeting.
Mercury, it allows us to utilize the design and create a cosmic space.
And by the way, we will be contacting all correspondents in the world to get in touch with us.
This is your job now.
To the company Mercury for artistic production.
And discussing its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works that have passed in the history of the world.
Do you honestly believe it's someone who actually wrote such words?
If you have no shame, then do what you want.
The eye is ashamed.
Can it be, we have journalists like this?
The expected journalist should have a principle.
Coming to you here.
What are they coming to, recording parking spaces?
I met you yesterday, oh brilliant one, you hurried to meet the minister, you know what he told me?
I will tell you about our series, it screams, it screams, and its events are strange.
Tomorrow is the first episode, and I will be with people in it.
What do you think, mom?
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: **"Which return, oh my mother, this is the one that just started, the first episode."**
A kid went and told someone else to talk to himself, except in Gulfistani series.
And then the mother started saying, "I will slaughter my children if you don't have any." And then she dried up, unable to continue.
Oh my son, art is a matter of taste, not of unusual cases that they bring and generalize to society and people.
Yah, this can be in fine art, but in drama, it's completely different.
Oh no, my head got hurt!
It seems that the
Don't you ever, father, ever control things from now on, at least watch the first five episodes.
The series is falling apart.
And it's a shame to let our children witness these things.
What's wrong, my brother? Not to this extent.
Many series, worse than him, are broadcast.
Originally, this work, oh brother Salem.
By God, it is your fault.
And your hand, every house.
Go and pick the people who understand dimensions and the secrets of lines.
And they displayed it for them.
This is not us.
Things happened.
The minister passed by accompanied by the guests.
I went to greet him.
We are the ones who agreed to the series.
What's the use, only whoever pleases the minister?
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Zayn, khal nisma3 ray Nasser.
And it was my colleague who directed the insult.
I only post messages containing praise for the series.
No, no, they will never get sick.
I hate to see what's written, and I will send messages from my own account thanking the series and praising it, and I will be the first to say that these readers sent.
God willing.
You will only be happy.
For this year.
This is something we agree with.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them, the minister's seeking minister.
I am walking with you, do you understand with the journalists?
Addresses, just addresses.
I wish for the re-rapening of conscience.
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series.
Would that they would repeat it a second time.
When I was first contacted by the Minister's office.
Here's the translation of the provided text: **The remaining batch, they have no money. We extracted the series for you.**
They cannot be blamed for calling you the magician.
And until now, you haven't dried anything.
The truth is, we've now invested our funds, made a profit, and the profit has been excellent.
And then, you see, the series is a failure.
The author himself spoke to him, saying, "I am regretful."
I'm here now, so I suggest a second part for the series.
The minister, between you and me.
A story involving the press, false success, and the success we achieved.
And he told me, "Look, I'm not comfortable with it, this series."
It means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part for us.
If the minister does not personally request a second part.
I cannot
Except that I reiterate my thanks.
For all employees.
In this series.
And I congratulate them on their victory.
Which they deserve.
The truth is that winning this work these awards in these ancient festivals...
He is the greatest evidence.
What makes you say such a thing?
I came out not an easy one.
The Golden Award is guaranteed one hundred to one.
What would Ashkan tell you?
Where do readers say we are dishonest, and where do journalists say we are dishonest?
Why doesn't he tell them in a second part?
As long as you have these Arab and Gulf TV talk shows, you do the artistic laundry.
Washing of the art.
I hear about money laundering.
This is not art.
Illicit funds.
The same with series.
What will we do with one and two?
How are we going to do this?
We are the signatories to a contract with them, so they must adhere to it.
Write them.
Our products are exported abroad, including Roti in its various types, small and large bread, triangular, mixed, and other unspecified items.
We are mute regarding the website and the contract with them.
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of the roti.
They told you what kind of product it will make.
By God, they told me about the roti, but what is the roti made of? How is it made? I don't know.
May God make it easy for you, may He keep you safe, my dear.
You call it a zipper.
It means instead of you taking this roti that you call sumun
This is the thought of the inventor, making it easy.
The jeans.
This is the secret.
You eat roti with sostha.
Man, they're doing some strange things.
This machine's dough, its preparation, is in a way where you, once the machine puts the dough in your belly, it melts.
Flavors of different strawberries from Sista Strawberry, Sista Strawberry, Gjet Sista, Coffee.
Do you know how much I am investing in this project?
Three million dollars with rights to the invention.
Come, Samih.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
At your service, Your Excellency.
We took her to the river today, O Long Life.
What are you saying, Samah?
Take them, your son Nasser, yesterday so they can play make the ball with the team that he is making.
I agree with him.
This team, what they've done to us, is nothing compared to the security and the drivers.
And we consider ourselves deficient because, my brother, we have no one but a single guardian. If he is injured, we will be in a difficult situation.
And I should, after I am created, have a fans' link.
And when you took the employees who, according to your mother, are number seventeen...
I killed you.
About the important people in the company.
Those who shape the core of the company.
I've taken the baker from the dough, for the hospitals.
And so, everything is complicated for the boy.
I will kill him, a flaw that should not exist. You are a boy from a well-known family, and it is not proper for you to go and chase and run after a dog and laugh at the world for us.
He takes what he wants, playing with them as he pleases.
But it doesn't take the important people who form the heart of the company.
What should I do, oh my team, they have a match and I am missing four players.
We don't want excuses.
What happened, happened now.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I got on, and I rode with him.
He told me to wear.
And they brought me, they made me stand, they questioned me.
The match appeared.
I no longer felt anything.
They tell me that if a football comes, I should follow it, but I don't remember.
You used to play goalkeeper before.
Just for the sake ofناصر.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Oh God, what a calamity has befallen us with this football and this nonsense.
From today, oh Nasser.
There is no such thing as a ball.
This is your team that you made cancel yesterday.
He returned all the popcorn to the bakeries.
What do you think, otherwise?
Dad, the topic.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I asked you, Abu Nasser.
Let's hear what the boy has to say, please, I'm begging you.
For you alone, oh Abu Ahmed.
I see, say what you have.
Tomorrow we have our last match in the cycle that we are participating in.
Don't break his heart, Abu Nasser. Please, I'm begging you, please.
Hello, guys.
Congratulations, congratulations.
Congratulations
Mr. Nasser, I need you for a minute.
May God bless you. My team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we must.
You promised to throw us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room for you in the hotel?
And once I let the journalists and newspapers know, they will be there.
No, Rashid, I will do it here at the الميلس.
So my father, who has experienced joy and games, and victory, perhaps what would make the team continue...
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup.
God hears from you, that's all.
No, I saw him. He took pictures with the players and had a press interview with them recently.
Waco, it's like Sami, the sports page editor, is going to do a feature with him.
What is the image?
He will not go far from me.
Come on, a picture that will come out straight.
You're not happy?
Fai, your comment on the win of your children, the bread makers, as well as the players in this great rescue.
With a fighting spirit.
And the effort
And loyalty to the bakeries.
Nasser means, excuse us, we watched the bakery team throughout the course, they were eating in a way of four, four, two.
Loyalty to bakeries and the trainer's plan.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
God bless you.
Here is the guard.
About the league and cup, he went to meet and make a deal with you.
No tail, not the council's.
Their representative is here for you to meet with them.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup.
We, you know, are really encouraging the youth.
God willing, I will witness that you will see it in the future.
Yes, with goodbye.
She, mashallah, your phone doesn't stop, and I'll take pictures of you in the newspapers, God bless you, this soccer ball.
You know what he was talking to me about.
He came down in price for the machines, telling me, "At your service, Abu Nasser, the ball is..."
Now you've become famous, and the newspapers don't put your photos in unless they write "Sports Champion Feature" under your picture, and it's published in International Bakeries.
I am away from the ball.
What kind of talk is this?
I have been since the day I was little in elementary school.
The one beside me was playing football.
You are saying far from the ball.
As long as those around me play football, I am close to the ball.
I mean, I am close to sports, I mean, I am sporty.
With that, we are no longer international culinary hubs, but rather international playgrounds.
Yesterday I heard him say that he wants to make him a club.
Of course, and today we meet the sports enthusiast at the international bakery, Uncle Abu Nasser.
To develop football.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: **We of course updated you before the match, wanting to know your expectations, and before you reached the podium.**
The game is difficult today.
And the team that controls the line of scrimmage will have their leader wearing high heels today.
God willing, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud, listen to me, that's it, God, God, seriously, seriously, God, God, be with him.
Listen to me, Dad. The deal that went, for the players... the shipment that we received.
We didn't benefit anything.
I gave you the prices.
I showed you the prices we sell at to the world.
So how, what do you mean? The Gulf is not like the world.
No
This is part of your work.
You just need a Gulf buyer to come, and I'll let you know.
Keep your fax machine on.
Two are defenders, one is a midfielder, and one is a central defender.
Look, my dear, I am telling you, the players are like the four tails.
Three of them are the leaders.
Two hundred thousand
Dollar, take them all, a big bag, one time.
How much would you give me, SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND? I will give you them in a payment of FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.
Sweet, now this is for the empty-headed ones. Now we've come for the Brazilian.
This is the season's player, this one with his spirit, with a million and two hundred thousand US dollars.
Putting this price, but afterwards I got a fax, I will show you it, where is it, it's right there above, wait I see it, I see it, I got a fax, thank you, that's from the UAE.
You are the owner of the mill, and the mill is your business.
Thank you
Here comes God, come, come, pat the man.
How? How?
The knee, the knee.
The knee is fine.
We will not cheat any more, there will be a crucifix or something.
O Abu Nasser
What is this "connective tissue" you're talking about?
The lamb is well-roasted, a blessing, for you have not spared.
No, honestly, Mr. Nasser, you were successful, meaning good players, meaning the Brazilian and African players, with blessings, with blessings.
May God bless you.
I say to the store, the warehouse, these cartons, come on, to the store.
Mashallah, you have a second business.
No, just playing around.
They will take out the boxes.
براعم اي نعم براعم انييبهم من وين من ادغال افريغيا
Yes, why not?
Kareem is an amazing hero with only one cartoon.
This is a human just like us.
They say to you, a sprout, you haven't heard it.
They say these are buds.
Now that we are...
Why don't you give us this, this little seed. Is this a campaign with them?
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Let me tell you, my father, Abu
Then the national team will go, then he will put this in the stadium.
How many, how many, how many, how many.
Roast it, roast it, on it, roast it, on it, because it will be considered tender, tender.
Put it in the supplement, airbouna, with goodbye.
Anything you need, the players are all with me.
If the coach owns this, he understands.
We are the winners, two-nil, controlling the match.
Dad, this is a trainer in Spain.
I don't like it.
Successful coach
He who organizes the traffic during the match.
For example, the North, this is a line, its opposite is the Al Wakra line.
To be honest, this is your coach. I won't let him do whatever he pleases.
Dad dad, the coach hasn't been with the team for two months.
I have to find a solution with him.
If he understood football, he would be acting on the flanks, not sitting for most of the match, attacking from deep.
Anyways, sitting on, depending on, the offside trap.
oh my god and whoever salutes you, don't get hurt, don't make my head lose its form
He is supposed to withdraw Kauthilamala funds.
And he will put his chin, his beloved, this wall, this wall, he will leave it.
No, no, no, no, no, even if there's no one to play with.
Shululu Habu Tu Ba La Wa, Khula Ayoli.
Any line
Execute the plan.
and the hololo
Something that is not necessary should not be necessary and should not be between a manager and a team coach.
And the match star today, and the team star scores a super hat-trick, God be upon you, oh Jake Olama Nando.
How do you mean, we don't understand football?
Hear, O Sultan.
Let him go home.
No, no, we won't deliver it by car. The bakery, let them take a taxi.
That's it, it's not your concern.
Oh God, keep me on the line with you.
I mean, good job, my dad did that.
The coach will make us sit like this.
What else is there?
The team was destroyed.
Rest peace upon our team.
Oh my, oh my.
He's not sober, meaning he told you, "Come, you are divorced." Tell the truth, "Between us..."
From the first day I saw him, I told my mother that this boy didn't please me.
I feel like he's not cut out for responsibility.
Let's get past the excessive talk and the reminiscing.
Go find out the truth from his father and know what really happened. Why did your daughter get divorced?
By God, I will tell you, O brother Rashid.
But what is the reason he divorced her again?
No, it's not allowed, Abu Abdullah. We must know why the girl was divorced. It's our right to know.
Please, you, I do not interfere, it is none of your business.
How can I not interfere when the man is there, sitting in the meeting, oh, he wants to know about his daughter, why did she get divorced?
He who is not known, can be respected as a husband or disrespected for his feelings.
And who is this Barcelona?
You're not to blame, not knowing what's right, a Spanish person.
This Barca is not just one.
This is Guardiola's team.
Okay, here is the translation of the text, without any added explanations: It means now I will go to the guy who is sitting in the mess waiting for me.
If you don't go, I will. No, that's it, stay here, get out of it, you people who don't know how to raise their daughters.
The door creaked, meaning it didn't shake your head like that.
Here she is, not satisfied with just siding against FC Barcelona.
Messi, the magic of the ball, who has never missed a match, recording a hat-trick.
Maradona, who is Maradona, said that Messi is better than him.
What, does your shameless daughter show her face and wrongly accuse someone? See for yourself.
Your daughter is neither a Barcelonian nor one of our own.
What do you mean by this?
Listen to me, may God guide you.
May your intention be that my son...
He will go apologize to her and make amends.
Lose weight.
And then thank God, we have a lot of blessings.
If we don't make our child happy, our money will be in vain.
Okay, here
I will conditionally arrange for you to marry a woman who is a Barcelonian.
يمه انا مب مظايق
Don't you understand, mom? Forget her, she's gone. May she rot in the depths of hell.
Here comes here, here oh mother
Did you know, Mom, that they are the ones who will lose?
You are one thousand times more desirable.
Here, mom.
It's a shame, you broke my heart.
Poor thing, it's been two days painted.
After a marriage that lasted only one month, oh dear.
What's wrong with you? Do you want to get me involved with him?
يمه مابي اتوهق معاه
And you're the one telling him this nonsense that doesn't make sense.
Ignore her.
You don't know, this one, a boy will come out of him.
This thing
It provided for her, that's all.
You are telling the building that I wished to buy and turn into a hotel, with furnished apartments.
What is in Al-Mansoura?
His father's right, meaning tomorrow when his son marries our daughter, I ask him for the building.
And if you can't...
Talk to her brother.
Listen to me properly.
Someone comes whose father is a millionaire.
Do you know what a millionaire means?
The opportunity does not come twice.
You know that because of their excessive lavishness, they have a mansion in Spain, but only to vacation there every year.
Here's the translation of the provided text
The people of the house, it seems, released this rumor about them to prove that their daughter is innocent.
And if we assume that the story is true and that the man loves Barcelona, has loyalty to Catalonia,
He supposed his wife to respect that.
He did not wrong the team.
This, if we assume the story is true.
May God protect him. They name him Abu Buraijin because he has two towers on the corniche.
He did them in a strange way like this, like a rope, intertwined around each other.
People who have been distant for a long time consider them to be one single borg.
What did you say, oh bringer of good, oh bringer of it?
Bye and hello to whoever is here.
May God keep you safe. Okay, extend your hand so you can eat something. May God keep you safe.
Thank you darling.
Just inform me, as my Abdullah's eyes await your response.
No, oh Um Abdullah, don't be worried, my dearest sight.
If I were to search for a council as great as the GCC, I would not find a better one than you.
Yalla, tell them to come back and provide us with their estimates for building the structure.
I am thus done, your highness. Do you command anything, long-lived one?
Anytime the family calls.
Look, get their wedding orders ready, prepare the bag, and I will sign it.
In the name of God, what God has willed. In the name of God, what God has willed. After your grace, sir, sir.
After Abdullah's divorce, he returned.
God willing, the children and the wealth, God willing.
May God bless you, my aunt.
You wear it for the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked for us.
Okay, here is the translation of the Arabic text you provided, only the text itself: **"Oh, I tell you where you booked for us."**
My mother says I booked tickets for us to Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia, come on!
Goodbye
What's wrong? Someone came from their honeymoon, crying.
What's wrong, mother? Tell me.
Tell me what's happening, oh my mother.
She's very insecure, oh my god.
Why does she think of herself?
Pride, let her take charge.
Oh my, what a sweet thing you did by returning her to her family's home.
It broke my heart.
Hi, either.
Okay, what's wrong with her like this?
What happened to her?
May God keep you safe, then don't forget to show us and tell us from Spain about olive oil.
Which Spain, where will we go?
Okay, he
My mother says I booked for us the right to the Maldives.
Yes, it's okay, oh mom, after the Maldives, it's beautiful.
By the way, I'll entertain you, God willing, entertain you.
Now I said you are returning, happy from the trip.
What's bothering my mother, why is he taking the children?
Come and take the bag.
What's happening between them?
What's wrong, making you upset, oh apple of my eye?
Shut up you and whoever gives you a push, you will teach me about my face and my son after.
What's wrong, mom? What's bothering you?
I saw the peels, I got depressed.
May the one who torments you, Mother, never live.
Let her take care of it, just divorce her, divorce her, don't worry about her, yes, even if you have no money, your father was rich, and there are many girls.
Shut up, you and whoever gives you a hand, my son. And I know him well, below anything, yes, what is its meaning, he lives bothered.
Go home, mother, call her and divorce her.
God has willed it upon her.
Yes, yes, say it three times.
You are divorced, moment by moment, no, you are hanging up, the call is disconnected, twice more, after.
Divorced, divorced.
By God, I'm angry, I'm leaving.
Just oh mother, go my darling, go and rest. Take the worry from your mind. The girls, for the comfort of those who carry, as they say, go oh mother.
Oops, a problem.
Just because he saw you at the club.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
He was shouting at me, oh my, that's it, divorce me. He said to me, "You are divorced." He repeated it. "You are divorced." He repeated it.
What a shame, he divorces you, the one who isn't ashamed on his face, he is truly a rude person.
Now if a woman leaves for the disco, what will she do?
And once when necessary, I will shake my head, it's nothing.
Nothing is wrong with it. What does it mean the world turned upside down?
I originally intended to go to his house, clean his sails, and then he wouldn't know who you were.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text you provided: **"I, I, oh Abu Abdullah, my daughter got divorced."**
My daughter got divorced.
Girl, a feather on her head.
You sell them and buy them from Toys "R" Us stores.
Like what has burned, he is now focused on his daughter and his anger.
And the most important thing is that they did nothing, poor things.
What, what, didn't bring you the peeled apple, divorce her.
Okay, you can use them as you like.
Damn, that's what a real [referent, likely male] is.
This is normal, sixty degrees of disaster, let it be.
And drink from the cup you drank from, the creation of Allah.
And what your soul does not accept.
Don't let people see him like that.
I recognize this land of the compound; this was one of his.
And in a strategic location.
Oh, let it be up to God, but...
No, it's a trivial and worthless amount.
I am currently standing.
I need to get approval from Bu Saqr.
Yes, Dad, I went to his office but couldn't find him.
And I went to him the week before last. They told me he was traveling.
The following is a translation of the provided text into English, focusing on accuracy for the given content. **Translation:** "Except for its smell, it's better tomorrow, not just after tomorrow. I am currently standing, the problem needs approval from Abu Saqr, it is necessary."
Go to his room.
No, no, no, no, this is official work.
May God have mercy on him. May He grant you safety and deliver the office, not the home.
after eating
This Bu Saqr, what will he satisfy?
Listen, everyone has a key.
Tell me, oh Abu Fahad.
You do not know him.
Here's the translation of the text, only the translation itself: What do I know about him? I only see him on TV, and you yourself didn't tell me that you passed away at the same time as him, during the Hajj.
But I mean, there's no great knowledge between us.
May God cut off your conversations.
May God guide you, and you didn't believe I called to lend, and I came at least to ask why this resolve?
After, is there an appropriate occasion? This is what God has guided you to.
The month has thirty days and is fifty times; it will host a dinner.
I suggest, may your age be long, that they put you, that they put you in the Guinness Book of Records for record-breaking numbers.
The person who can make dinner the best in the world.
Shall I tell you who this brother of yours is, who is with you?
Welcome, it's a blessed hour, by God.
It is an honor for us, may your age be long.
Hey, Abu Fallah.
You are saying that Abu Saqr every day makes dinner.
This is what we see.
Just, oh farmer, dinner tonight is a special occasion.
Today, may God keep you safe, your son, Falcon.
Mashallah, he deserves it, long may your age be blessed with prosperity.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: May the righteous son be a good omen, now that his father is alive, greetings to my father.
Peace be upon you
What happened, what's new?
On this occasion, tomorrow, my son Saqr will pass by the agency and choose the car he wants.
For a year and a half, I have been waiting for approval.
He stood still.
That's it, when I reached him.
And his luck/fortune.
God guide you, but oh Abu Saad.
It's not like this things will happen.
He killed him, that's it.
The exhibition visitor walks around and chooses the car that he likes.
We buy him three.
I will take you to him.
I am myself taking myself to him.
You didn't tell me that you found someone of the same age as you.
Today, his son Shaheen the Younger.
Here's his game in the evenings.
This is your chance.
May peace be upon him, and may God bless him.
He deserves to be safe, O'Long Life.
Mah Shaheen, oh Abu Saqr.
May God keep you safe, and may you be spared, O people.
Praise be to God for the safety of our son Shahin, may he be long-lived.
May God keep you safe.
Except for the brother.
May your life be long.
You didn't recognize me.
By God, may you be spared from such a thing.
I was with you, may you live a long life, a lifetime of years.
Even though I mention, I bought a red rosary.
I am God, bless you.
I was in the hospital.
I visit one of our children.
And I would be honored to meet you.
Here is the falcon, still hesitant, whether to enter the field of trade or to decide.
I wanted to be with him, brother.
Why, father, Saqr, trading is indeed good.
You never got yourself a desk.
بو صقر
The old man, don't deter me, and say it's done.
What happened?
A falcon is mine.
Whole floor
And if trade favors you, with what you have, it will tell her she doesn't want her.
From someone like you today, with everything available to you, you're the one who took the driving license, for which praise be to God, and the world opened up for you, with a car that's free, and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz told your father, "If a falcon wants to engage in business with you, I will be a fifty percent partner."
Oh my, how will I reconcile between business and university?
Yum, don't force me to do anything that I don't like.
And you, mashallah, agencies, offices, cars will be deleted for you for free.
A chance, my son, in these times. Now is when his trade will begin, without a capital.
You are your capital, the love of people, not your father.
Stay smart and invest it.
Believe me, my son, this is your life's opportunity.
Please, quickly prepare lunch.
What's wrong with this, or that, or this, after arriving for rent and pepper?
He didn't leave anything, not even for tomorrow. I'm still afraid he'll take the sambusa.
The hollow was born, his self opened to the business.
This is what you were hoping for, you know what he's going to say to me today.
"Ma'am, I want to expand further after investing."
He wants to put his hand in the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And keep away from him the eyes of the envious.
Sultan yesterday told me, "Your son has just joined the business."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and shares in two banks.
He gave him the useless elbow that neither a certificate nor a reputation wants.
Apparently, God knows best, that until now they have not opened it.
This one, the one in the northern part of our office, what's wrong with it?
I just like it.
May God bless you, may God grant you blessings, congratulations to you, O Abbas.
In the name of God
May God bless you.
The easier it is, the less regrets one has.
What is my father? What is his full age? What is his hardship and fatigue? I prepared the supermarket.
What's going on? It seems like he comes every day to pass by, to reach the deadline.
He saw him, Trash, I don't know this secretary, what's his name, Samir.
He says this is a matter of severe tribal dispute between Bu Sakr's family and yours, regarding the shop location. He proposes that instead of a violent dispute, you enter into a joint venture partnership with him, effectively taking over the shop from him under these new terms.
After how long have you had a partner with you?
There is no strength, nor noblesse, except in Allah.
I'll just see if you suddenly start talking to him, huh?
He asked me, "Who is the brother?"
I killed him with my dick.
Why do you tell him you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking next to this store, not at a small sign that had what what the name was on.
Written, Al-Farid Bakery
No, I want a name that is different.
And peace be upon you.
How is work with you?
May your age be long, God willing, tomorrow or after tomorrow we will finish the plan for the workers' housing for Future Company.
Alright sir, this is my madam Alyssa. I know you, sir. **Note:** This translation focuses on conveying the core information and relationships within the text. It preserves the informal and direct tone of the original Arabic.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you are very kind.
Even cooking, this is the art and science of it.
Today someone will come to you and tell you, "I am working in the field of business. I have a certain amount of money and I want to invest it."
But this is what is between us, he has neither an understanding, nor knowledge, nor study in economics, nor even in trade.
Something like this
You believe he will succeed, but I don't believe he will be successful; he will waste his time and ultimately lose.
I heard, Abu Nasser.
I heard these chattering birds on Monday, saying something.
What kind of talk?
This is with you and I have a falcon Mashallah, it is.
May God protect him, what a blessing.
They will eat it today.
We are not talking about your son, Falcon.
We are talking about Al-Qaeda.
Your son, Falcon, God bless him, and God's protection over him, is an exception.
May God reward you for saying it. They will tell you to talk about Al-Qaeda.
We were startled by a falcon. My son built himself, a son of himself.
That's all, he just gave him a car as a gift.
He sold it, invested the money, and based on a piece of advice from him himself.
What God has willed, has indeed happened.
Oh, the one who became, we are talking about ordinary people.
And one of them became their leader, the one they did everything with. Abu Nasser took him and placed his hand on the path.
What God has willed for him, a falcon with commercial trading talents.
And immense economic tendencies.
We must ask who his father is.
It's a shame, I, by God, am astonished.
Masha'Allah

Here you go / Please go ahead
And peace be upon you. Welcome, welcome, Salem.
May there be no evil.
By God, I don't know what to tell you, Salem.
Yes, he told.
I saw that the story is really true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
and they said to him, enough
A house that cannot be endured.
Like you can see.
They say when he first heard the news.
He fell on the desk with the fax machine in his hand.
And he, so he was favored over him.
He is the one who said, "I taught him how
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salem.
I, I am shocked.
Is there really something like this in the world?
A man gives to the poor with his right hand, without his left hand knowing.
This association, of course, is the one whose donations reach all Muslims throughout Asia and Africa.
But of course, I want you to also explain this to us, oh long-lived one, about your goals and your future steps, God willing.
We aim at the Khairiya Society to achieve solidarity within this community.
In addition to sixty tents, a gift for our brotherhood who have been devastated by the earthquakes in Pakistan.
This is also finally, not last anymore, meaning we are now appointing seven poor families.
Monthly salary of nine hundred and thirty-two pesos, and no more.
No, we are not late for you.
And afterwards, we will immediately bring you.

This is Khalid and his wife, Azimina, who are hosting us tonight at the hotel.
Yes, indeed, any place, any place, you and I, we will be in it, I will be happy in it.
My life, may God protect it for me. Oh Lord.
My heart's core.
This is my livelihood.

The captain has arrived, and breakfast is being served.
He wants real men.
May you be sufficient, O' long-lived one.
What ha
No, the request I am making of you, I must hear the word "done" from you, hear it ring in my ear.
Hello Nora
Alanood is upset with you.
Why am I the one initiating the upset?
God willing.
Why are you sad?
Noura Amnia Fasthan Amsattan wa Sambal
Do not say such things, it angers and upsets.
What a lot of Lebanese people, their tongues are sweet.
You too, don't get too friendly and give too much.
I also want to be careful about her.
Even the sweetest dress for the sweetest Noura.
They will pamper her, even calling her Noura.
How much time is left for him?
My twenty thousand and the rest twenty thousand Arias.
Congratulations, may you be compensated. God willing.
God be with you.
Hello, may your life be long, Umm Saleh.
Fadi, you look busy. I don't want to delay you.
My eyes are present.
Hello, hello.
The message reached you yesterday.
Here arrived, you scoundrel.
And you liked the joke.
Okay, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, you show your designs and I choose from them.
Honestly, your taste is even better.
They make us work, and envy makes it.
Yesterday, I saw that my project went perfectly and started bringing in good fortune.
He's telling you there's someone who will work on a project like this.
Design and detailing shop
Women's clothing
This is Abu Nasser, who has no connection to trade.
Your son is here.
A boy sees his cousin.
Of that sort these days.
Good, good, my cousin.
Do you believe I was sleeping and they woke me up, saying, 'Your cousin is looking for you.'
May God be good, it's a treat.
God willing, it will be good.
If only.
What are you intending to do, any project for example, I mean for example.
To just be, oh you, do you want a partner or something?
I heard, I mean, they were saying that you are intending to, I mean, maybe something along those lines.
Hello and welcome.
If you want more, it's available.
Praise be to God, the work is excellent.
What do I want to do, Abu Saleh?
But we are late, they extended it for a week last time.
By God's.
Yalla, we wish you well, God willing, with safety.
It remains so.
Are you sure?
And with it comes a detailed explanation, and you don't know the major trouble.
What is after?
It's a lease for a shop next to your shop.
Oh, you envious one, you spiteful one.
Before I knew the market was open to all.
I need to be recognized.
Your heart should always be open to your cousin.
Okay, here is th
You deny, attract, laugh at me, WhatsApp me, and you do it to me.
I wanted to do my work quietly.
You are taking the place of a sticker that was attached to my shop and ruined it for me.
By God, that's it, but they didn't say, "Come here, sit." In my mouth, it's pointing towards the wisdom tooth, it's driving me crazy.
This is envy, this is grudge, by God, by God, I will make you kneel, this is grudge, break me with it.
Oh, you are people, my dear ones.
May God be with you
He brought me down because of him, I swear by God. Because of you, you will be humiliated, I swear to you, you will be humiliated, oh owner of a small waist, you are
I extend my hand just as you extended yours, and you remained while my portion remained.
Oh, my people.
O people, pray for the Prophet.
I didn't do anything, I swear, I swear.
He advised me to bring a designer from the Philippines.
No one will cut you off.
Why, why, what's the meaning, Lebanese means?
Have a relaxed and enjoyable conversation with him, teasing him, laughing, and enjoying each other's company to the fullest.
I see, Abu Saleh, either you bring a Lebanese one.
He sat there, telling and persuading me.
He enchanted me, enchanted me with his words.
And convinced me and let me pay twelve thousand aryals.
And a couple of days later, God knows, you're going to the flea market and find the cup right there, a twin brother, smiling, for nine hundred ريال.
And take the money.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
Can I meet the teacher yesterday you told me it's difficult by the river and today it's still difficult.
Yes, today it's also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed the past couple of days.
What is it?
What do you mean?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically tired after his cousin opened a shop and brought a Lebanese designer similar to him.
For the past two weeks, the sales of the store have been affected.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "What is this defect that is here in Ghatr? There is no Khatri. He opened a shop for him, unless he comes Khatri again. He will implement the same project and open the same shop next to it. Is it possible for me to enter it?"
Hold on, I need more context to provide
How is this even?
Sitting like they've eaten poison.
If we continue like this, I think we won't even enter the shop.
A place far from them, meaning.
This means, clear the field for them.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: "Alright, thank you, and how much is the discount?"
What's the point, meaning God willing you won't give away with every wedding dress, evening gowns for free.
What's wrong, get up.
What's there, what happened to the shop that gave you the discount today? They are running an advertisement with every wedding dress, two evening dresses for free, no, and after a twenty-five percent discount.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
No and hello, I will wait for you for two weeks, they will come back and they will put up the same dress, so make one dress for the wedding and you will get two dresses for free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I am thinking like this too because tomorrow if I leave them they will ruin our house.
Never mind.
What else does he have?
This means this is a challenge and I thank him.
This is not a real challenge.
Well done, you're doing well with him, the unlucky one doesn't want anyone else, he's just making a living.
Hey, no worries, the news will reach you in two or three days if I don't close his place one last time.
Well done.
Stay stay sugar sugar I am coming coming to you now coming quickly come quickly peace
What's happening?
Saad says the place is unbearable, you can't sit there, it has a bad smell, he says he doesn't know where it came from.
The smell is not related to this air conditioner, no.
It smells so strong that it wouldn't leave the shop even six days ago.
One hundred percent.
Great at night.
The wires of the electricity to the store were cut.
This means this is fair.
Now you will sign a waiver or we will file a lawsuit and open a case.
It seems to be doing something to him.
Annihilating from existence.
Hey, Uncle Bonasser, something strange is happening. Nobody is entering the shop.
Mr. Abu Nasser closed, closed, closed, a customer coming to me, I'll tell you again, it's strange.
He is sick and lying in his bed, calling out.
I say a psychological state. Usually, I, my brother, feared to tell it. The bank is calling, and they want the installments.
Debts piled up on him because of his cousin, this unlucky man.
What happened this time, Zein?
And if they accidentally enter the store and find the designer, Saad, shout in his face and run away from him.
He lay down upon it, and it was upon him. What he desired, he would not find. His eyes were not upon it, but rather he was looking at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
I am at the store.
I don't know, maybe he cast a spell on him.
When a man is seen by women, they invent fears for themselves.
I don't know what he did.
He lost me, he lost me.
They gave me a lot, brother.
I'm afraid they will imprison me.
And I don't have any leverage against him to go and complain about him.
I don't know what he did.
Let him deserve it.
And whoever is going to hand you over, tell me what kind of magic you've done to him. You've made the designer turn into a monster, and the women, if they see him, become afraid.
He got an rumor about him.
Hey, it's not going to happen, folks. Tell him, tell the whole photography crew that you need him urgently.
Hey everyone, and may God bless you, keep you, tell him he wants you urgently, desperately!
By God, they are going to give me a stroke, they will slaughter me, they will paralyze me, it's not acceptable, oh professor Abdullah.
Maali Ahmed, my love, you, don't get mad like this. You're a hearty person. This kind of behavior doesn't suit you.
And I swear, I called him, how many times? He hurt me, he really hurt me, but it's no use, these extra people drive me crazy, drive me crazy.
You don't do anything, everything is on my brain.
Here's the translation of the provided text:
Here are the translations, printed as requested: * حلاه خمسه وعشرين مشهد سطاشر يالله ياحمد عايزين نخلص
And then, I mean, I stop filming because the extra actors aren't there.
What is this production?
Okay, what do I have to do, Mr. Abdullah? You're telling *me* to do something? Why would I do that?
My love, do you want anyone to interfere with you?
What's happening, Abdullah?
As a late extra and the ones in trouble.
O Ahmed, I don't want anyone, my love.
Jaw *for* me one *is* هيبة, *is* هيبة. *To* convince *the* people *that* he *is* truly *possible* *to* be *a* millionaire, *to* be *a* billionaire, *not* *just* *anyone*.
Professor, your Honor, enter forcefully, only photograph, and your request within half an hour will be prepared.
Not just anyone, Alaa, not just anyone. I'm still, I'm still clarifying for him, I'm still saying to him.
That's it, I'll manage myself with two scenes instead of one.
You bear the responsibility, and you, the production manager, bear the responsibility.
And now what will they do?
They are doing everything internally. The director is angry, and this is a matter for God, but they are acting.
This one wants someone with specific specifications, to find him securely, that's the water.
Are you serious, really?
I didn't hear what the director was saying.
I have someone, God help you with him, hopefully he will be useful.
This appears to be
Saud Quwati, I am the one who knows him. Saud Akenar.
This is the day when he was young, they used to call him Saud al-Kin'ar, and when he grew up, they called him Qwati.
Why are the pipes?
I am telling you why the poor man was wandering the streets, picking up bottle caps, and selling them by the kilo.
Brother, sing and it will be majesty, not a disappointment.
It seems he must fit in. Here it is, go on it, what I told Madbah is like this, and... it's not tall, it's not wide.
It means it definitely works.
God willing, but I'll just tell you, make sure you fix the makeup, it's a hundred percent, it will work, he's funny.
Okay, what are you waiting for? Just call him.
I don't have the number.
I'll just take Amir with me and I'll go to him.
Where is Saoud's gothic house?
What does this say?
Shut up, shut up, you.
Saood Kuwaati
We don't have a single person in our neighborhood named Saud the butt.
Of course, I'm sure he's in the neighborhood, but which house did you forget?
This is one house, its owner is Saud, he lives there with his mother only.
Okay, correct.
Just this is not Saoud Quatties.
This is Saoud's laptop
Sure, it's just evolving with time. What's a laptop compared to a tooth?
He is tall, strong, a bit reddish-brown.
You'll find him canceling the old ones and starting to crush old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, oh man.
I am going to the vegetable market to buy them for me, where is the second one?
By God, I don't know.
This is what she wears all the time.
I have a second one, I'm next to the second ghutra, where is it?
The right of return
This is what I'm looking for, where is it?
FEX and BUFAS
Dad, iron it a little before your mom sees it broken.
Just these two days, that's enough for me.
Yama, may God guide you. Since yesterday, we've been worried about you. I took you to the emergency room. I took you to the emergency room, and you told me no.
Hey, they told me they'll give me a sale price.
Praise be to God, here is your father, oh your brother, here is your work, instead of your worthless sitting.
Okay, here is the transl
She went to fight, to be agitated, a fool, going up.
sit for a bit, slowly move and have the camera with you, move your feet
Yes, Jaafar, yes.
Who is this laptop for?
Any Aboud, the Real is a Big Abdullah Al-Lamma
This is yours, with me it's mine. I am the son of Fat' and Aboud. What's your news?
How are you, Abdu?
But enough, calm down, here is where you respect yourself a little in front of people.
Which boy is in our neighborhood?
Settle, settle, settle, settle, yeah, yeah.
I love to act, God willing, they will give me a role to knock on.
I swear, dude, it's not a big deal.
I'm tired, I swear, I swear. You wouldn't believe it, yesterday I couldn't sleep, dude.
Albuttu yukhy Allah yashfi
May God heal her.
Fallen in love (or experiencing passionate love).
Sir, Sir.
He has asthma medicine, yakhy, the mother's right.
A director, not a doctor.
Get off my back, listen to what he's saying, and for God's sake, you have absolutely nothing to say.
What is this thing, mother?
Spit on you, what are your opinions?
I heard what you were saying about her.
It tells you it's light, let it be a bit heavier, a bit heavier.
Give me a push, a push, a push, a push, half a million for repairing my tire.
And give him three million, he'll bring me dinner.
Toni, can you tell me why you are saying this?
Because I am heavy, according to some people's requests.
Gulf, oh professor, you are unaware. Our production is
Currently excellent, meaning it's either suitable for the role.
Sweet. Me too, but I will help you. I am a viewer, I have nothing, nothing is true.
This is our house.
By God, I am falling into spring.
Take the teacher and bring him to the makeup room and do his makeup, and God willing, I will make him wear the clothes for you.
Walk walk walk, very nice.
That's not
Listen, brother, leave the car with us. Once we're done filming, I'll call you. Come and take it.
Don't worry, someone can just pick me up.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Will get you, Ali, Khalli, Adhebulna, Will get you, Mashkoor akhooy Zain, Mashkoor, Mashkoor, Lahza."
Alright, here's the translation, based on the input:
Hey everyone, call Soud Laptop in the makeup room.
Let him then, my brother, clean up, look at his clothes.
As written in front of me.
Let's say.
I'm done then.
I didn't expect it from you.
We don't need to be silent about what.
We are not going to be silent about our rights.
Wait.
and I know from whom I talk, Abu Abdulaziz
Why did he divorce her, why?
Just divorce her, that's it.
And we don't take the daughter of a thief.
No, it doesn't need it. What do you think?
Alright, here's the translation of your text, focusing solely on the output: **when it's just gonna be then the important thing is just to get yourself ready because you're going to go into the changing room to change your clothes and we're ready for the shooting.**
Look, my teeth are very expensive.
Oh, you're kidding! This scene was weighty in its filming.
Why?
We don't want this, dude. We're tired of this. My stomach is puffing up. What is this? This has been happening for an hour, and we're wondering how long we have to wait.
Dad, I'm still in shock, I haven't processed anything yet, this is all still very normal for me.
May God give you well-being.
Speedy, mashallah.
May God keep you safe, long may you live, in God's protection.
Greet the group.
Their saying is that Bouabdulaziz greets you. Their saying is that Bouabdulaziz greets you.
May God grant you a long life, God willing.
It's sweet.
What are you talking about?
First time someone loved me on my own terms.
How do they love them on their noses?
This problem
His nose got like an ice cream stick, cracking. Your palms are sweet, sweet.
I swear, even after you, I haven't laughed.
Don't worry.
It means fixing an actor.
I hope there's no bad news, what's wrong with your voice?
Grandfather, grandfather, I'm tired, I'm waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Welcome, sheikh, welcome.
Hey man, search here or there, look for yourself.
Listen to me,
Yes, come on.
Empty, with excessive reverence.
I'm going through a lot of changes, Dad.
And peace be upon you. How are you, may your life be long?
Let it be, let it be, let it be.
And don't worry, God willing, you will be, Dr. Hassan, come come.
Well, Dr. Hani, what is it?
Let your long-lived [someone] rest in the office, then...
I didn't get caught.
Everyone, God willing, you will recover safely.
Here, take this, you are of high rank, here you are.
Shut up or I'll give you a proper beating.
Here is the translation of your text: **"I hereby state my name as Bouabdelaziz."**
Call me, say "Uncle."
How are you, uncle?
By God, look at this face.
Yes, may your age be long.
Here you are, sir, please have a seat.
May God bless you.
With this chef.
Go with him, Mr. Rashoud.
By God, if he hasn't done anything to you, inform me and I will show you what he has done.
Hey buddy, can I get a doctor quickly?
Doctor, my mother is a patient, and...
Wait the turn, your turn is coming.
Listen to me,
Possible companion.
Oh father, quickly, I'm tired.
Oh, for how many times you've gone to the hospital, bringing your mom every week. You haven't seen a single one of them, and they are all beautiful, accepting even the slightest of requests.
Not like the local girls.
Country girls, keep them separate.
Okay, listen, go find a woman at the hospital.
It's a whim.
But dude, you're not giving me attention.
Okay, here is the translation of the text, without any added explanations: خلاص عيل تقرب منها اظحك لها خزها عطها رقمك وانت نيتك زينه
There is nothing there is nothing.
Respect yourself.
And if you don't, then you'll face consequences. Be careful when you speak.
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm fine.
It is not necessary to leak.
Assan Khatori ana
No, thank you.
You can take it and go.
Those who talk to you are good people.
Marry him, meaning marry him.
No, it's okay. I want the jacket and I want the clothes and I want the car too, I'll rent it from you.
For your safety, your payment will be as agreed.
Okay, here's
Oh God
What is this? A mess. A loser.
Hello and welcome, a thousand welcomes to whoever joins us, a thousand welcomes.
Yesterday, my eyesight looked bad.
Just, I wish you were here.
I'll tell you to be amazed by what I did for them. It was a very classy, distinguished, and elegant party.
One regular and the other diet.
There is no more excuse now.
What is this?
Oh my, I have a date with my friends tomorrow at work.
God willing, this will reach them.
What's wrong with him?
Noura, come here.
What is this?
He takes this to his employers, to the owners, to the high-ups, to expose their wrongdoings.
The way you say it makes everyone talk about us.
And give me money, and I will go and buy you something fine.
Okay, I will translate the
I have to take him tomorrow.
Here's the translation of the provided text: "We're not doing it now. We've opened our eyes and we're going to bring something that is bright and that everyone will see."
What's wrong, come on.
And its price is affordable and its quality is very good.
Above average means not the highest quality.
Even if there is chocolate for the eyes of the devourers, but sorry, I thought maybe you wanted the appropriate price.
After these, going is precious, what is it for, still they take us, for the most expensive.
This is not possible, check this artistic touch.
Haidi is the name of the royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that the Spanish royal court always orders.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, she also has a certificate of warranty.
Here's the translation
Come on, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
I'm saying what occasion, wolf?
Not Saleh Abdul Qader, who is in the accounts.
With blessings, he deserves it. Come on, give me one too. Come on.
And get us to the cafe quickly!
Auntie, you went to their wedding.
My dear, I went to their wedding. It was a complete failure, making me want to throw up. You'll never believe, my sister.
I heard your aunt's words.
That's why I want to give you a wedding, whether it has happened or not.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: Here is nothing left, I have nothing but a month and a half.
I am arranging everything.
But oh here he is making me.
You are not living in society, you haven't witnessed people who are getting married, they put their dowry and their wedding jewellery.
And as you saw with your spirit
When I bought you something good, you saw how they praised you and your taste.
What did they tell you, it's wonderful and beautiful?
Okay, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the kaffi, which brought four sheep for the wedding.
And whoever hands you over, you should not interfere with your mother. You know what you should do. You are responsible for giving her the money, and that's it.
So their meaning is that they agree to anything we choose.
And frankly, you have no taste.
What do you think about the Halkusha?
But discrimination costs more money.
Why, why, why is the one who left beautiful?
What do you think about this?
First time in Qatar's history, someone is thinking of having a mouse-shaped wedding cake.
Excuse me for a moment.
Look, you keep talking about everything except the seating and the equipment. This is the place where women who have nothing else to do gather. Women who have nothing to say.
The Real is waiting for us.
We want this kusha for the pampered one.
Weird cushion
A guess model in 2011.
We have taken the mouse.
Relax yourself, all of this is for your benefit.
The important thing is to choose if Noah's Ark will be increased by twenty thousand, or if a mouse will be valued at one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Show us and we are ready.
You are not the first person to get married.
I think you're getting married in the Comoros, but that's just a wire in the country.
And we are just at the beginning.
If you don't want a booth, then where will the bride sit in a sahara?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
People are enjoying themselves.
They are exploiting us and cutting us off. These are con artists, through and through.
And what does that mean now?
He's frowning and looking upset.
She doesn't want to get married, that's it.
I will contact the mother of the bride and tell her that Saleh is going through difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married, he can't afford the wedding expenses. It's normal, you want to talk to her, it's true, I will definitely talk to her.
A shipment of roses arrived for us today from the Netherlands.
I think that if I put them on the tables at the wedding...
For sure, it's the first time in Doha.
And the Middle East after?
Put it on the bill.
How much more can it increase?
Amy two seventy yes that's it
Just then, Samir, I can't see this formation, at an important wedding, among the important weddings.
He found out after people's talk.
Okay, consider yourselves booked.
You are paid more than me.
A door previously unknown, unrecognized, will open for you.
May God help you, Saleh.
Just come on, God guide you, you should have tried to gather things a little bit.
As for me, thank God, I have decided to go and find a righteous woman from any Arab country.
They say there's a wedding there that won't cost you anything, only one thousand two hundred dollars, and that's it.
May God bless you, my love.
God willing, next month his wedding.
You just have to bring a card and tell me.
The cards are for the intended purpose. The important thing is that people know they are invited, where, when, and what time.
This is all that matters to you, not what people are saying.
People know the level of the wedding from the cards.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English: "Tomorrow, if these cards are not available, I will know what people are saying."
They leaned on their wedding, since these are their cards, they haven't seen the cards of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we will order it from the internet.
Its cover is a piece of panda bear fabric, and it has a G-Flag, which is a type of flag used in various contexts.
You're not to blame, but I'm not to be blamed by you.
I don't become a stick in the mouths of women, calling out to them, asking them.
I swear you broke my heart, my brother.
Poor, his family must be very strict with him.
Oh man, no one has left that no one has borrowed from them.
What are you saying, even his car that he sold?
His face is as big as twenty years old. In the morning, his eyes found him walking and talking to himself.
I don't blame him, my brother, he is poor, I swear. I don't know when we will develop.
Close the door, and it's your command.
Forgiveness, my brother.
You didn't try to convince them that you were having a small wedding.
What do you mean, for me?
Why am I living alone?
The problem is that our society is sick with appearances, boasting, and arrogance.
It is imposed upon you that you must be a patient suffering from the same disease.
If you want to live in it.
Once I glimpsed the mother-in-law's right.
I only wanted my clothes.
Let it be up to God.
Tell me.
How did you get married?
And I don't want to marry a madman.
And then, brother, even if you decided that I should get married.
I am considering taking a foreign language, or even an Arab language.
Yes, by God, they'll tell me.
By God, we were planning to get a DJ for the songs.
That's just because Umm Nasser is the real mother of the groom, that singer.
This singer is famous but his name, people have forgotten.
What's wrong, you didn't study for the exam?
You're not liking what I'm doing.
He sold his car, and every day one of his friends drives him.
While I was helping him, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see your words have changed now.
For my brother Saleh, oh my, he is tired, that's it.
I have nothing to do with you or him.
I am not less than people.
Don't make a fool of us.
And whoever hands you over, oh mother, but my brother spent everything he had and didn't leave anyone who hadn't borrowed from him.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: **"And whoever makes you [someone] quiet, you just be..."**
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother told her to cancel the wedding, as she no longer wants to get married.
Now where is she?
Inside Aisun, they have first aid.
He says now it's better, but they will arrange a room for her in the hospital.
Your filthy whore
You are resting your soul, my sister.
The doctor told you not to speak and not to give you an injection so you wouldn't fall asleep.
Where can I find comfort when he leaves us looking foolish, deserving of mockery by those who are worthy and unworthy?
Hey, tell him to bring us Abdullah Arwishid. He says he doesn't have any money.
This appears to
He was afraid for her.
Go to her, have a spirit with her, and kiss her on the head.
And I'll just do what you want.
Beeeb, you went to Abdullah Arwishid.
Bo Yusuf is good, I don't think he will be unfair to me.
Shame on you, I couldn't find anyone but Youssef.
What's wrong with her then?
You built it, Salah.
But the minister is keeping it because it's very old and even though everything is not perfectly adjusted and trustworthy.
Do you want my opinion, Dad? If you went and told him the words you told me, it's a big possibility that his heart would stop.
I understood
For the sake of the awful crisis you are experiencing, you want to ask BuYusuf for money, of course, from the ministry's funds.
By God, I don't know when you will return them to him.
Here, if they don't come for this group of auditors, ask them about the money.
He might go to hell, of course.
No one will know, and then he will know how to act.
By God, how are you? The ريال is in his office, and you are carrying the responsibility. If something happens to it,
The end of my life, I am stealing.
My uncle, they don't call this اختلاس.
On the first step.
On it, there is a white Gothic script with a blue stripe, and in a circle, there is something like what you say, like the picture of a dove, oh oh.
God willing, my uncle is my uncle, Abu Yousef. I, I, if it weren't for my difficult circumstances.
I'll give it all back.
They called me Bo Yusuf.
You are the last years of my life.
You ruined me, Khamees.
Saleh Saleh
Hasan, listen to me. I swear, if it were anyone else, they would be punis
Saleh Saleh
All the roads I tried were in vain, Uncle Bu Yusuf, I am drowning, that's it.
I can't back out now, especially with the wedding.
These people, you know them all, they are bald.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
No, the fear is not, the fear is not the second time.
On the stairs, on the stairs.
My uncle Bu Yusuf, the stairs are full of nuts, which one of them is.
The Goth with the Real picture, scared.
We booked two rooms for ourselves, just for makeup and hair.
And from tomorrow morning we'll be there.
Yabna Abdullah Arwishid and his band.
You will see my love.
I won't tell him.
Bomb of the season
We are the first people to use it in the world.
Oh my, oh my.
Yalla, with salama.
There is no god but God.
Yuma, don't forget, tomorrow if you enter the room, read the Mu'awwidhat.
The women here, their eyes are sharp.
I told you it was awesome.
A beautiful groom, God bless you. I have my eyes on you, you have my cold heart.
يمه يمه الشرطة يطرقون الباب
I am wrong for having obeyed you, O God.
It's forbidden, today is my wedding.
Ah, what is it with this auditing?
Oh God, open it wide, I'm going to prison.

Too late
That's a shame, dude, if that happened.
The company submitted a contract for three million, with two million of that being the value of the materials.
He wrote a note for the minister.
We said there was corruption, but it never reached the levels of true corruption, to that extent.
You seem like you're not living in this world.
Minister, what did you say to Othman?
And our manager, why didn't he protest? They say it was because he had...
I don't know about him, I really don't know.
Where are the morals?
The truth became a lie, and the lie became the truth.
Oh Saad, are you sure the minister has fired him, oh people what's happening in the world?
Fansha and that's it
What's next?
The king is the brother of the minister.
And this girl is involved with the minister.
Oh, world.
What's wrong, you didn't recognize her, this is from
This is the new employee that the minister appointed as a replacement for poor وعثمان.
Walk, walk, walk.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? I oppose the minister.
You are crazy.
Listen to me, father.
We have children and want to live.
I want to live.
What happened?
There is a poor man standing at the corner.
The end is sincerity and honesty, my brother Saleh.
Jean, we can do something for you, my brother.
Praise be to God for all circumstances.
What's wrong, Saleh?
From these strange things that have been engulfed in this world, indeed, our existence.

This is my colleague, I am with him at university, what is wrong if he gives me a ride, it is normal I mean.
Wow, wow, wow! I can't believe it. What's wrong with you? You seem like your old self.
What would you say?
What are you listening to us say?
Your thinking is old.
Right and wrong, there are still new and old.
The correct is correct and the wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved; we are living in the age of technology.
The era of global variables, which harmonize the world and no one can keep up with them.

I am of course very keen to meet you on the first day of work for me.
It is an honor for us, may your age be long.
Certainly certainly
Of course I know that you don't need anyone to remind you of the basics of work.
But at the same time, it is very important.
We regain with each other the values and principles that were poured.
For the general good.
The expected thing, long may you live.
We all have to
The looting must be long, your age.
You will be thieves.
Thank you, thank you to all of you.
And what I want to say after
And I warn you from the first day of my regular work.
That between you, one employee.
Amin, sincere, loyal, and dedicated, and from such useless things.
Just a doubt.
There is an honest employee.
In order to be able to take the necessary legal action against him within our ministry.
May your age be long.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"Certainly, long live colleagues in front of and behind them, I say..."**

Why do you let the devil deceive you?
Thank God for the one who comes safely.

A respectable woman had her body and charms covered.
And cover his chest, after which I here wearing a suffocating age.
She wanted to be with you.
And furthermore, oh father, she still has a desire for something I and another male possess, specifically pants, that reveal roughly half of her upper abdominal region when she bends over, above the waist.
But it is no use, don't listen to the words, don't want to walk the right path.
Here I am, telling you.
You only blame yourself.
We are seeking the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.

Hello my darling daughter Mona
Majed's name was not Abdulaziz.
Any justice.
My daughter spoiled me.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in the year two thousand and ninety, after the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel.
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and blockade against it.
Its end is what provokes the Israelis and their Arab friends with claims against the Palestinians.
Who are they escaping with plastic knives through the tunnels?
Especially the second clause, the paragraph beginning with the letter "Fa" (ف), which states that the Palestinian people should continuously and meticulously cut down their nails every day.
We now move you to the decisive meeting.
My cheap sir.
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the State of Israel.
Hey man, what are you saying? Hey man, shame on you for damaging our reputation. Forget it, leave it to the other person.
If you please.
Pardon, Mr. Tiger, Pardon, Mr. President.
Let me have the floor.
I have fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this man, an Israeli delegate, talking about?
We have anything solid, be it stone or plastic, committed to it.
Even our homes, man.
What do you call it, you Gulfites?
In all of Palestine, it is made of wood.
Companies in America, according to the agreement, manufacture cars for us made of wood.
And the doors of our houses are all made of thermally treated solid wood, man.
We do not want speeches.
Do not change the subject.
Mr. President
This point is important. Please vote on this matter, as nail-biting is a breach of the agreement.
Let him who agrees raise his hand.
Just had a strange dream.
To dominate the students.
I wanted, and I kept telling him.
This is the fourth school I will be attending tomorrow.
Because I am imposing my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys will not leave him alone, and they will tear his clothes, while he remains silent.
How many times have you come without a visit?
He told me their manager.
Rashid is good, we don't want to fire him.
Let them play, the children, with chalk.
His wire head gleamed in the vastness, before the entire world.
They said, "This is a teacher with a weakened personality who ruins things for all of us."
I tell them the story of the kategb.
Maryam is back.
And what's after this story that's being told? This is new, no one told me.
Give him a coin that will bring him a complete one to the chair.
He sat down.
And he didn't know about the story.
Except for a dry day when the children will laugh at it in the schoolyard.
Enough.
Here's the translation of the text, as requested: Your manager, whom you will be working with tomorrow, spoke to me.
But never mind, we will still give him a chance.
To wait, I will tell you.
The era of good and evil is over.
Oh, son of your uncle, oh Abdullah.
I will look for a different Rashid.
And it doesn't need me to remind you of the important educational saying.
You are a graduate of education, and I am a graduate of education.
And we all know the saying.
The teacher, son of the first class.
I will make you laugh, Mr. Rashid, the strong one.
And what I want, I will do.
Oh, woe to him!
The first time you spoke, they told you to be quiet. What are you going to tell them?
He is preparing to attack.
Who among you mocked and said "Be quiet, that's good"?
You are the one who killed
It's not me
Oh, the one who told you...
Go tell the manager.
and saying "Professor Rashid, dismiss me."
I don't want to see a patch on your face. Here, I hear.
What do you think about my irritability?
It's not just like this for the first day, it's like this the whole year.
Oh, woe to him!
He who hears his voice.
And I am explaining, or I am speaking.
Do you know what it means?
Nervous, you know what a nervous person is like.
I mean, nervous.
Did you hear what I said, or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of line.
Go to the real manager.
Okay, here is the translation: Let's go, take your things and go out.
Take your things.
Okay, her
Sure, I'll still look for it.
No, professor, we didn't see him.

God willing, Tamer, something after my friend Abdel Rahman, my friend.
Now no.
We learn from the story.
Of course, you know that I am leaving this week because I received approval for graduate studies.
I said, I must submit the concert file before I travel.
How should I take you in the afternoon, Abdurahman? He told me, "I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't specify the time to me."
Madam, his father has just returned from a trip, and he hasn't told you anything. Thank God, I've managed to take care of everything.
Maybe if I had gone today afternoon and he was upset and didn't say the right things to his father, no no no, this is a bad thing, a very bad thing, no no no.**

Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "In a teacher, he goes to bring water for the student. You are his assistant. No, no, this issue will not pass well. I will write it in the report."
You're also making a mockery.

We are here with Uncle Bu Nof to *understand*, not to *shout*.
Who is this Rashid, acting arbitrarily in the neighborhood as he pleases?
You made me talk.
Okay everyone, be quiet and listen to uncle BuNayef say what he says.
Now, this piece of trash, this worthless entity, plays with your nerves for nothing.
Leave it to me.
If I don't give him a slap, I stick him to the umbrella that he made.
The game plays with its people.
That's very good.
Goodbye.
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store.

May God be our substitute.
Just walk, you'll be fine in the heat.
Rashid, who is simpleminded and has nothing, really became like this.
Appointed as the Deputy Director General of the World Intellectual and Educational Federation.

Don't worry.

Thank you, and you were not at all remiss. A greeting.
Greet him.
May your mother, after God, grant you safety. May He inform you, God willing, that He will greet you.
Oh God, with peace, my love, may you be in God's protection.
After my brother gets engaged and becomes a minister, but believe me, father.
That's it, mother, we will work, we will work hard.
But if your dad doesn't say anything about your work, that's it.
That's all, he gave it to you.
Okay, here is th

My dearest child, please fulfill my dream.
Before your dream was my dream.
Build me a tower among the towers of the corniche.
Yalla, what are you waiting for?
Thanked, thanked, thanked.
You're up to the challenge, Abu Saleh.
I'm telling you, your friend looks annoyed.
By God, it's not apparent on him, my brother.
You're up to the task, Abu Saleh!
He believed, so he put down the mobile phone and gave it to Bu Saleh.
Look, these are movements, and for sure, Busultan is a million percent carrying a grudge against him.
Originally, it wasn't a good relationship between him and Bu Saleh.
No, Busultan, he wouldn't do something like this unless he had something in mind.
Is it really to that extent?
He returned and closed the car door for him.
Finally, the car minister's doors will either close or open.
Oh father, don't hurt my heart, don't hurt my heart.
The point about what we hear in cafes is now happening in the country.
But I'm not believing what I'm hearing.
My heart is stopped, my heart is stopped.
I'm afraid, my dear, if the story goes, it will fall into the hands of the women, and no longer will it be the domain of the mother-in-law of the dishes, my dear, you have disgraced me among the women.
Say something, Busultan, you're talking nonsense. I'm shocked to my core.
Please, I know what I need to do.
Nobody has any business.
Amnireh, I am working on it very calmly.
Now that I've opened the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan I have in my head.
I would be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plan.
Leave them, let them remove it.
Any plan.
But he has to trust me in the beginning.
They told me his eyes are a minister because he was appointed before you by two months.
Because I am guaranteeing his shillah and naqfatuh.
Magic can be broken.
What is it?
What is next?
And every activity the photographers forbid, you will shoot until their picture burns in the newspaper.
And its smell rises until it floats on the surface.
definitely back
You be patient, let me work on it and I will promote it.
In reverse, may your life be long.
Certainly, Your Excellency the Minister.
Then come tell me.
Thanked him for the sheep, it's good meat.
The الريال at the door, go get it.
Don't be miserable. People want to benefit from you, and you want to diminish yourself.
The Minister, he just تفضل, he preferred.
No, I won't pose for a picture. No, the minister just wants a picture, a picture the minister wants.
Give him a solid slap, man.
By God, my brother, your plan impressed me a lot.
I want you to take it in.

Any minister must

Every day has its picture or two.
As you said, an active social worker, God willing, with peace.
They all love you, but you don't know what's wrong.
A fight in every corner.
These two are envious, spiteful towards you. Do not throw stones at the tree, but at the fruit-bearing tree.

Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very generous.
Shut up, his name is Abdul-Hades Abdullah, shut up.
This is my husband.
I, how much, with Mom's talk?
Three hundred and fifty
May this be a lone wanderer.
Until today, at home, I hope there is no evil.
By God, let me be the one today who is absolutely exhausted, with a p
I'm tired, I swear I'm tired. It's been a month and now I'm looking around.
Let me relax today.
Hello, welcome, Umm Sultan.
I say
Hey, just when you're about to give me a ride.
I see you flattering her.
You saw the same thing last month, what does it do?
I know, thank God, that you are convinced.
It became clear, honestly.
Your minister this one is a bit passive, it seems the past situation really appealed to him.
I'm deaf, brother Saad.
I swear, I haven't followed any activity today, nor have I read the newspapers, I don't know why.
Okay, Allah, with goodbye.
God, if He wills, the fall of an ant will be the same as if it were given wings.
Peace be upon you, my brother. Do you not have anything tonight at the hotel? There is a conference.
Wedding
Ava means everything, it means there is no activity like this, it's a birthday party.
Mmm, I don't know, but maybe you can see the hotel that's behind us.
Yes, there's a hotel behind you.
Okay, I'll leave you in the car and head to the hotel to inquire.
Go, go, go, take your comfort, go, ask.
May God grant success to all, God willing.
Will this minister let us sleep and rest?
He means he couldn't find either a party, a wedding, or any other suitable situation to invite him into.
Fifteen thousand hotels, and he couldn't find anything. His luck is bad, just like his face.
Be quiet, just answer.
I couldn't find him a birthday.
The truth can be caught in the second half.
Every number has a hundred pictures.
This fellow doesn't sleep, this one isn't seen, oh my brother.
Oh man, this guy is a total crazy clown, saying these are the first things, then describing his image and after that making a crazy clown face.
You're telling me my kids were having a competition about a picture of a real estate minister.
One person asks the other, and the other tells him, "Today, how many pictures are they putting for the minister in the newspaper?"
And whoever wins, they give him a prize.
It's not like that, the story, you come to the cafe and listen to the comments, every day about what I'll be photographed in in the newspaper, they'll tell you talk that doesn't stop at all.
God, his nearness is fading.
That's it, according to their saying, the butterfly until God willed its demise, it approached the light.
People give you as a gift, and they greet him.
He became one of the most famous celebrities in the country.
Watch out for you, and who would this be?
You ruined my prestige.
May God keep you safe for her.
You all say that we all got married except for Amal, poor thing. She's the only one among us who didn't get married.
This is the share/lot/portion.
It is not written for me to get married.
And I have already forgotten the topic of marriage.
Allah is sufficient for me against those who have been the cause.
They see those silly, flirtatious people over there.
What's wrong with them?
They see the one who plays with his hair.
This is a boy or a girl.
After my father died, and I mean to slaughter him.
Yes, his size has increased, that's right.
It's a shame to leave him hanging out with the housekeeper.
Okay, go do it.
I wanted to talk to my mother, but it's not just having one maid. It's having two.
We told Jamie a million times, you have no business with Khaloud. This is my son, not your daughter's.
You have nothing else to talk about except for Khulood and the workers, the workers, and Khulood.
Yيمه mub jain jathi Kholoud arba'a wa 'ishroon saa'ah ma'a ash-sha'alah wa maby ybi gheeraha
Come on, get out of here. Let me rest. I want to sleep. How am I?
My father Saud, your brother Khaloud, your brother is becoming his own child.
Wait a bit, if I don't inform my father about you.
By the way, what's wrong with Khaloud?
Saud says that Khaloud wears makeup and acts like a girl. "What's the story? What's the story?"
So so so upon you, O Saud.
Someone put makeup on their face, Khaloud, unless you are a doll with a lot of makeup, oh you with the painted face, and played with the makeup.
I saw a big one, and even it wasn't shown.
Okay, beautiful, delicate.
I am fighting with Saoud.
It's been a long time since I saw you.
Here is your translation: That time, Saad, I asked you, "When you grow older, what will you become?" And you didn't answer me. Now, answer me: When you grow older, what will you become?
And you, my immortal beloved, Saad, will become an officer. What will you become?
Next year we will go to London.
Here comes the trembling word in Bahrain.
Let him come, bring a lion and cheetah, and a mare.
Goodbye and hello to Samura.
I seek the forgiveness of God, the Most Great.
Today my dad told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you a land plot by the sea or a land plot that is next to us?
I killed him, I don't want to choose.
I, my love, live with you wherever.
Thank you, my love.
And taught me how to fish for salmon.
God, oh Amal, I wish to close my eyes and open them again. And they tell me, "Oh Amal, you've finished university."
This appears to be a
I don't know, but its smell is very strange.
Oh, what's wrong with me?
Your tone of speech has become feminine.
You forgot that you are a Real.
And God willing, after that, I will talk to people outside.
I can't believe it, Khaled!
Please exit my room.
Alas, O Khaloud!
I fell from my eye.
Come on, that's no way to hurt anyone's feelings. I swear, I'll tell my mom.
This is my first son and I know him well.
And upon you too, O Khaloud, O apple of my eye, O if only all my feelings and thoughts towards you were reciprocated.
And you, I hope you haven't found one, gentle and serene, that you called my daughters.
Shame, shame you would say such a thing about your brother.
Just get used to it, it's small.
What is he worth? Put some perfume on him, he smells nice. Now what is the difference between men's cologne and women's perfume?
Are you and will you tell him this story for real in front of your father?
I have
I'm just showing you, but that's all, so that Mohamed doesn't feel anything.
Oh, where did they gather these girls?
By God, it's a shame you did this, this girl is beautiful.
Do not watch it, do not watch it.
I am truly afraid that I will sense that something is concerning me.
Give yourselves rest.
I know that you are looking at the widespread Bluetooth these days.
I am waiting for Saad, but let him come.
What's your news, Saad?
May God keep you.
I'm telling you, we're waiting for you. We haven't played our cards yet.
Why
Will you drink something?
I see him lying here, near you, in the apartment. It's been two days.
Regarding the Bluetooth story.
Which old brother are you an ally to?
Afraid of him
Don't try to kill me, that's it, don't try.
Seek refuge in Satan, oh mother, for my sake.
I have already booked.
I'm fed up, where can I go? My face is a scandal, who can look at me?
What do you tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, what ails them, these children, what ails them, what?
This is how it ends, mom.
When Khalid was young.
This is definitely going to be the result.
It's a shame, really, but get up and go outside.
True words often hurt.
The jar broke.
I will never live in Doha.
I have no interest.
I have been hiding my phone for a while.
And you blame me, oh hope.
This, and you are a daughter, staying awake the whole day in the house.
I said to myself, "A real man, one who spends his days meeting people outside." الشرح: The translation aims to accurately convey the meaning of the original Arabic text, while respecting the implicit cultural nuances.
Hard, oh Amal.
I couldn't live my whole day and my whole life, my head on the ground.
My father has been feeling that something is happening at home, and there are changes.
And when will my father, who is absent from the events happening at home, return?
My father, sometimes I blame him, sometimes I don't blame him.
No blame for you, Amal, when you remember his misery and his dedication to his work, all for the sake of us living with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he left his responsibilities at home and for the children to the mother.
We don't want to dig into the past.
He knew my father or not.
That's all I'm going to say.
Bluetooth it to him.
But I'm not going to give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my father's face, in my eyes.
It hurts a lot.
Whatever it is, oh hope.
Does he know through us?
Better than anything known through others.
How our house has fallen to this degree.
Because a filthy bomb named Khaloud exploded in him.
and customs and traditions
Teaching them with all rudeness.
They turned their ears away from it.
And they will not hear of it.
No, just one voice.
It is the sound of filth and abnormality.
They will take all the good.
What came to your mind?
Suddenly, I decided to travel for study.
All I can say is, "May God grant you success, my son."
May God grant you success.
They returned the gift they wanted, the ones who had come from a journey, not the ones who had traveled yesterday.
Your words are correct.
This is the base.
But for every rule.
Come, my dear, come quickly with me.
Oh my, it's dry.
He didn't hear anything.
Bosaead
Bosaead
Bossaead, what's wrong with you?
Grandfather, what's wrong, grandfather?
Dad
Don't be sad.
You are a great person.
A young man would wish to marry you.
I did not divorce you out of a defect in you at all.
I divorced her.
Because I am impossible.
Accept, he is my uncle, my children.
A gay man, just like your brother.
This is Salouh.
Boring every day, I congratulate myself.
First, none of you are showing at all.
They are hiding under the ground.
That's the first one under the ground.
By God, strong talk. You are equal to such talk.
You are a fool for one thousand two hundred and ninety dollars, by God, it is a lot of money, huh.
Say "Mashallah."
Let's go, let's go.
Here you are, it's been seven months, enough is enough, you've given me a headache, oh God, finally take me home.
A failure and a scandal.
This driver is cheating you.
For seven months, nothing has become to him.
My ear, my ear.
They took him away and left us with him.
Send him away and bring someone else.
Fahmi, my son, doesn't know what this word means. He doesn't know the losses of money and time.
Driver training, finish it, let us be done with it.
You are the first day to come home. I am here before six months.
Okay, here is the translation, based on the input
This is oil in Ahain and Ohud Miyah Irbatash Riyal Fa Al Fi Al Kilo Noss Riyal Hoo Fi Khamsa Riyal Kalsh Iji Ghali Baba
That's it, you're being a brainless hero. Listen, I'm telling you what they're saying.
You are the first time to come, I don't
Seven hundred is what it gives.
You are new, new. You are six months, and you haven't seen this, for 800?
I want money.
These drivers, what are you saying? Old, old, you are new.
This is seven hundred and fifty-eight, then eight hundred.
This appears
This says that for one hundred riyals, it will come.
Three hundred is of no use.
I am one, you are many, good.
No, Shashi, there's a problem with time. There's a lot of time. I'm in, it runs away.
No fear, Shashi.
It lists from a sponsor the money he provided.
Why are you a cow?
This person, this individual, what is their initial sponsor, whose money is it?
Mash kam malom sitta miya sabah miya alhayn malom kam hesl hoh
How lazy are you?
Wool is not you coat.
There is no Kouf.
Allah is sufficient for me against them.
I sat down to film, and suddenly his soul left his body.
Nobody
Even the phone I bought has a bundle.
Here I did.
Did you do it after?
They did their best, took his passport, and kept it with them.
It is easy, O Hajji, you are authorized.
Tomato, everywhere.
Here is the translation: Here is the problem, here is the problem.
After all that, they are scattered/driven away.
They deceive us and watch us.
I told you to send him away.
But never mind, you think about Khalia.
He appears wherever he is.
The provided text
I would rather pay his ticket and send him away than have him sit in the country, earning money.
Draw well, I wish I could just catch it.
Comrade shower inside now, there is no one to buy now.
At the beginning of the match, it's as if you are very afraid, I can't help but notice that.
But they are afraid of what they are afraid of, that our team will not score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified and afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not scared of the opposing team, I'm scared of our own team. I fear that they might not score. Let me tell you more than three times.
This is the level of our team, I know it, I am talking about the level of our team.
Great trust from you.
This opposing team has nothing.
Cute foxes, oh father, say now you have advanced with the first goal.
Where would you go?
He went home.
In a car.
Come, I will take him with me, I will take him with me.
Ah, my thanks, oh companion.
Why are you trying to defeat our team?
May your life be long; the matches are just beginning, the league season is just beginning.
You didn't hear what he was saying.
They say many problems exist.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Yallah Mahmud jeeb gay
The soft companion, he comes, he goes, he puts on clothes, come on.
Here you go, Uncle Saqad.
Here you go, sir.
What is he doing to himself?
Ah, the Indian guy.
Yes man, that's a soccer rule.
There is no saying, this is team talk, not me, I am foxes.
Gather the leaves, the leaves.
Yalla, ya ساجad, yalla, ya ساجad, besor3a, besor3a, betebtedi al-mubara, besor3a, geeb wahed maye maa inta al-tha'aleb, beyal'aboon al-yawm, besor3a.
Our esteemed viewers, we have with us one of the most famous supporters of the club, nicknamed "The Foxes" (or "الثعالب"), and its famous fan is "The Fox".
But they are the ones saying that you won against them because they are the deficient ones.
This is in the speech, this is in the speech, there is nothing good.
What is there, what is missing? This, this is a team, everything, everything, a team that has one dozen people.
And a half, minus two, minus there is no use, half half.
This is a demon fox.
This is our best fan.
Okay, on the occasion of this win, oh clever one, a final word I direct towards the clever ones.
All talk, stand firm.
When we consider this in the words of the Foxes.
This is inside a sky, very high.
This is the fairest fan.
Look, my brother.
You're likely excited like this:
Here you are, handsome.
Where is the Indian boy who dribbles the ball?
I haven't seen him for a long time.
Hey man, this is a big, big, big, big, big, big,
The translation of the provided text is as follows: "Hello, I saw him a few days ago, I don't know him. He was sitting at a café shop, something like that in Flagjo, it's called a Star Bakx, a Star Bakx, something like that."
I remember this guy used to hang out with us in the cafe. He never had a cup of tea.
This is my son, if the boy gets twenty riyals, it's good.
What the hell did he do like this?
Hey man, he's dealing with the big-wig club officials. He's got it sorted out, you know, they're not really pushing it on him.
I say, "Tha'lab."
My mother slept.
My mother says, "Do this for my husband, do this for my husband."
You have no story. Be a fan of a terrible, tired club like this one.
This is the team of money foxes, the heart of my money is.
When my heart stops.
Good, very many, certainly a problem.
You, may your life be long, have you not heard the poem that was composed on the subject of judgment?
The day our match was with them.
Please, please, O Tha'lab, speak, speak, this is a poem, speak, speak.
My mother, oh God, there is a secret world that I do not know.
This is the same as my money, I am in and I have a lot.
I am not at night, everyone is sleeping.
You know that we are the fan club for the Foxes.
You cannot tell me the name of the winner because I would have an exclusive scoop.
We have a press conference and God willing, we will announce the name of the winner.
Say of the one whose beauty...
This fan, famous for his "Tha'lab" (Raccoon), is the very person honored today by the management of "Al-Tha'lab" (The Fox) club. It's a very generous and beautiful gesture.
By God.
Tha'lab of a thousand congratulations on this beautiful recognition and a wonderful gift, certainly.
Are you going to say that this is in a pen or a crayon?
By God, it is him.
This is in its turn.
I tell you it is.
I must inform the police.
Sit down and be quiet.
Cheering for all, all, all, this for money, a cheerleader.
No, Dad, it's not him, he looks just like him.
I tell you it is.
You are late.
I don't know when the games are or what the times are, dude.
Okay now how are we going to catch him?
There is nothing to do but wait for the Foxes team to find out when they will play the next game.
There is a palm tree.
We will catch him.
Dude, you are late.
There is there is there is
He has the right, the right, he has the right and behind him.
The story is that we are not sure if this is now true or false.
I tell you, he is, oh father, he is.
I say the opinion and wisdom that we should go right to the tails and ask them. We say, "The driver, the one you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?"
Dad, you have to make a trip into two trips.
We will report, I am sure it is him.
May God protect you, your generosity, may God bless you.
Registered in the name Mali, nam, in my name.
This is in the second earth that is next to its money.
Say, O Hake, your father, may he hand over to you the son of Abul-Rahman al-Sabbagi, what is safety, what is safety, what is safety.
No, thank you. It seems we are the ones at fault, not you. It feels like we are wrong, or perhaps that you are right, and we are mistaken. In a way, you are a very close friend, and in another sense, you are almost like a family member to me, simply because of the deep connection and understanding we share.
God, glory be to Him, creates all things, and out of all these things, one thing is like a single thing, while the other is like two things.
Thank you, long life, thank you.
Thank God, may He protect you, forgiveness, forgive, thank you, thank you.
Yallah samahuna add an 'an rakhasatukum ana laysan malkum samahuna ma as-salamah karamukum Allah yallah ma as-salamah
And you tell me after I'm sure, huh?
What will he do to us now? May God protect you.
What have you done, my little one?
Wow, me, me, walking, the bags, he showed them in it.
Oh God, open the heavens and rain again.
Go, get in your room, go!
God help, that's all. God help, that's all.
God save us.
Come on, now understand what your father meant by this now.
Before my father knew.
Fragmented into one million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's go buy one just like it, quickly.
Before my father came.
And whoever brings you safely, oh mother.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he becomes like a madman.
You go to your room and don't come out.
He didn't do anything.
He accidentally knocked the vase with his bag, it fell and broke.
يمه انا خايفه عليه
I don't know where he went.
No, this is his father, he's not sane.
Shame on you for doing this to the boy, like this, oh mother.
Amazighin, his heart, his madness, you want to be like this?
I say, "Mom."
You are hallucinating, I mean, where did the boy go?
Okay, if he just does this, I'll just call you.
God save us.
Auntie, I know where Walid went.
Come, I will tell you where he went.
Oh God, oh God.
I know here.
And whoever hands you over, my grandmother, I don't want to go home.
Fear me.
I didn't see the vase.
By God, I don't know.
This is your father, God guide him, scaring you.
Come, oh mom.
Don't be afraid, Mom. As long as I'm here at home, that's it, Dad.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid.
He asked for his request, oh Abu Walid.
For your sake, I will forgive him this time.
I don't see him at home.
Where is he? Where did he go? **وينه هو وين ذلف**
Where is he? Where?
That's it, father, that's it, son. Don't be afraid, your father didn't do anything to you yesterday.
Sure, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
Leaving her here, I'm afraid someone from the kids will come and tell her, and break her.
He is the one who recommended it to me, telling me he wanted something like what I had broken, which was given to me.
Exactly, man, I went, but I didn't find anyone but this last one in the store, his luck is strong. Oh, woe to him! Where are the children?
They study in the room.
May God protect it.
That's it, I'll
Oh my goodness!
Okay, come on, get studying!
Dad, just this one game, and we'll be done.
Dad, and whoever brings you, don't say it's your uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother, Dad, last time, I swear, Dad.
I will contact him.
And you in particular, wrongly accused your friend in the cafe. I...
Brother, if you don't know, your brother will.
That's it, I'm not connecting. This phone is in my pocket. As long as I'm thinking, that's it.
يمه why don't you take it for the doctor
May God guide you, my mother.
The Amazigh's heart and fear, from how much they endure it.
Poor is this boy.
Became you.
Oh my, where is Amoula? I can't see her with you today.
She went and with her.
My sister, this one doesn't get enough of the play.
Oh my mother, I didn't tell you the story of an innocent girl with her son, Nasser.
Her son at an age, Waleed Allah, may He protect him.
And the same length
Yesterday you were telling me you didn't know what to do with her child.
She wanted to take him to the hospital, but her friend Youssef was there.
Dar al-bariha 'an al-salfa. Yesterday, from the story.
And Hauwsha, and they called out to her.
He says how didn't you tell me
This person has a psychological condition.
The boy is forced to urinate.
He takes his son and ties him to the middle of the courtyard.
Then he will tell him to do it a second time and to urinate on his bed.
You are just whispering in a ruin.
What did you say, O noble lady?
I tell her, "Eat, eat!"
They ate, you are welcome.
Oh, just my luck.
يمه يمه
When your father didn't feel you, that was good.
Otherwise, I would have slaughtered you.
Okay, here is the translation, based on the provided text: **"Let's go into the bathroom and wash before your dad wakes up and makes a mess for you."**
I have nothing to do with you.
It is a sin, the poor things.
Sitting, crying, shaking.
I'm scared something will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to teach them a lesson.
Nervy I am
They did not fail, they are successful.
Why would you take them to their uncle's?
We are filming, bring me then forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they want fifty from fifty?
Their uncle is warning them.
And to be honest, I agree with his viewpoint.
Keep emotions to yourself.
My brother Ayad is in trouble.
Bye bye
Last time, last time.
fifty of fifty
Let him waste our time. I assure them that this is our son.
Why don't you bring fifty out of fifty?
I, I, I warn you, but you do not listen to words.
What are you hearing?
Splendid life
Let's, let me teach him a lesson.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Yes, that's it, Uncle.
So that next time you are reviewed properly, here you are being reviewed.
Okay, just this: **Yallah bas**
Do you know what I will do?
And I'll drop you one by one, I'll make you eat falafel.
Be careful, you might end up in public places with your relatives.
Let's say there are ambiguities.
Mr. Walid is shouting.
What's wrong, are you crying?
This is an excellent grade.
It's strange that you are crying.
You are supposed to be happy.
You, my son, everyone else took the buses, you went and waited for anyone to stop to take you.
At the school gate, it means waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off, but they weren't with them.
Have you heard about the boy who committed suicide today?
This is a private message.
His father is threatening him if he doesn't achieve the complete sign.
Waleed, Waleed, come back, Waleed, come back.
I salute you on live television and welcome you to a new episode of the show "Without Borders."
Oil constitutes more than thirty-five percent of the total sources of various types of energy.
Meanwhile, the rest go to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
And therefore, oil is considered the first source of energy in the world.
And the Arab Gulf states and Iran alone possess six hundred and eighty-eight billion barrels.
Followed by Iran at twelve percent, then Iraq at ten percent, then Kuwait and the UAE at nine percent.
For each, then comes Venezuela with a rate of seven percent.
Then Russia with a percentage of five percent.
The Gulf States and Iran hold two-thirds of the world's reserves.
to unprecedented prices, exceeding one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in its history
And in this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil.
The problems that face the exporting countries for it.
Despite the enormous increase in its prices.
And also the problems experienced by citizens and residents in these states.
Due to inflation and an unprecedented rise.
Which will appear successively on the screen or they will write to us via our website on the internet, www.aljazeera.net.
Because today the market is the primary factor
And it is not the producer countries.
The determining factor of price is market power.
Not but the OPEC
Of course, the principle of offer and demand has its part, of course.
But other factors
The other factors are the political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets
And markets, the Al Al Al Al Buoys and others.
And they headed towards F prices in the speculation.
In the chemicals sector, including oil, for example.
And tomorrow a thousand dollars will arrive, God knows best.
Oil in 2004, jumped from $44.40.
And today we are seeing that even the prices of oil.
Fluctuates between day and another.
The price of oil has fallen below ninety dollars.
And rose in the second quarter
Entry of spring two marks the entry of most of the world's refineries into a period of maintenance.
Which is always the case for the girl in the second quarter.
The seasonal demand for oil is decreasing.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
This alone does not indicate that the speculations have any power and control over the market now.
I traveled a lot, I mean, when we return to the traditional market, the past...
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
The seasonal demand, supply, and show are seasonal.
Today we see that there is economic growth.
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, commander of CENTCOM and Central Command for Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked huge reactions due to its connection to what is called the looming American war.
Political or geopolitical effects.
It affects the oil market, whether in a negative or positive way, in a manner that means very quick.
The impact may surely come, to which it will be a significant influence.
Even if it's speculators, they also interact through political speculation.
That might confirm, saying to you, "Perhaps." Some of them are saying to you, "The American war on Iran is coming."
Here's what the market will be like, the market will be optimistic, the market will be in a way.
Question in the light of His Excellency the Sa'ah, the Deputy, now in the light of that the White House...
This returned the area to a climate of tension.
This is the qamooz.
But perhaps Fallon saw this scenario.
It reflects very quickly on the oil market.
Today we are proving with numbers that there is not any scarcity.
Let me give you an example within the past seven weeks.
In the United States, the oil inventory has increased to more than the five-year average.

Nor even for the next war, because today I am telling you, even the world has a stock of unsheathed
Even today, global consumption is such that if you look in any country in the world, there is a long queue, or a line in front of the gasoline stations.
This is something else.
What is the danger that this matter represents?
What number do you expect could be, I don't know, it could be?
Two hundred may be three hundred dollars, it may be less, but
It may escalate if these tensions reach a revolution or genuine tensions.
Because as you said, the Gulf region constitutes sixty percent.
In a country, I mean, it's so far away that it doesn't even produce oil.
Look, the effect comes back negatively on the oil market.
It can reach up to three hundred dollars.
And they moved, transitioned from stocks and other things to the oil market today. See above the two trillion or the two trillion dollars.
Today we are going to see the print.
They speculate on it, above the one hundred barrels per day. Meaning that.

Despite the fact that the return is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say seventy.
But the experts' words are not my words.
Okay, the dollar fell by 35%, and oil rose above this new decline.
Meaning if we take the reference year of 2004
Let's see if oil prices, meaning ranging between $35.30 and $36.30.
It means, of course, it means.
The price of oil has increased.
But the increase is slight, an hour for the deputy.
It means if we take them.

It means if we take it as a comparison to the year 2004.

The falling dollar leads to higher oil prices.

Dugan's announced in his publication yesterday that there are four countries, that there is Qatar.
But there is also a report by Al Finomeh Al Khaleeq, stating that there are four Gulf countries, as Oman has withdrawn from the unified Gulf currency.
I have read the statement regarding the statement in Dujons, and I do not believe it to be a genuine statement.
He is the director of the Qatar Central Bank, who issued a denial.
He said yes and said that it will study, but also that all Gulf countries must.

The political decision is summarized by two things.
Neither is there a third to them. The first need.
Concerning its intention or the five, along with Kuwait, concerning its intention in 2010 to issue the currency or to study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is that a decision to disengage from the dollar is issued.
First, regarding the unified currency.
I, in my personal opinion.
To see the unified Gulf currency.
The currency, when this currency will be strong.
You will be.
Perhaps one of the strongest currencies in the world, as she says.
And what is behind it, the precautions, and what is behind them, the enormous revenues.
Therefore, here is what he focused on, when the Prime Minister said...

Stressful situation
الفين and eight, according to observers, Global House said that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the allied nations, but the solution lies in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries to seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To halt the process of inflation that
Here's the translation of the provided text, presented as a single, unadorned output: And here is my question now: When will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
And listen from you the answer after a short break.
On the topic of today's episode: The strategic oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, specifically the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
She has a reserve of two hundred sixty-four billion.
And two-tenths of a barrel.
And select nine and two-tenths daily.
Million Kuwait one hundred and fifty and seventy-five billion and seven hundred and ten million.
Qatar fifteen and twenty-two billion and eight hundred and fifty thousand Oman five and six tenths billion and twenty-eight thousand.
Bahrain Mih Khamsa wa Twenty Million Wa Tetantak Khamsa wa Talateen Alf
And it was twenty-eight billion in total revenues for the year.
From two thousand three to two thousand seven.
In Europe, there is a hundred billion.
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries.
The total GDP of the GCC countries was in two thousand and six, seven hundred and seventeen.
Gross output in two thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine point seven from ten billion is expected.
In the year eight hundred ninety-eight twelve and one tenth of a billion.
The following text is already in English and only contains the translation of the original text: "either the inflation that devours the salaries of employees and workers and those who live in this region"
It will increase from 2.008 to 2.008 three tenths.
Kuwait: fourteen percent, or an estimated twenty-eight thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight point eight ten for ten. UAE: (Same as Kuwait, but listed separately)
Ten will become ten. As for Saudi Arabia, it was six and a half, it will reach six.
And eight out of ten.
Earnings are being consumed.
So, what amounts and percentages will you increase the employee, who is a good person here, with?
If we want the problem to be addressed.
With genuine processing.
Salaries are always increases. Salaries are always increases.
It is not the solution.
I am not against a pay raise.
True, I am. This is not true.
We are always
Of course, there is faith.
The increase in the increase, and the lack of control over inflation, will cause inflation to consume all these increases.
To address inflation, a supreme committee has been formed, comprising all experts and specialists.
Now this committee is putting
Because salaries are increasing around the world.
And the golden economic rule says, of course.
It will be endless.
And whatever
Wages rose and whatever increased.
The inflation rate will increase.
Treatment is necessary and must be undertaken.
I mean, with a scientific study here, the institution "Bayt.com" which is specialized in recruitment, conducted a study in conjunction with "Yاقفون سيراق البيريطانيه".
They conducted a survey on fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries across twenty important sectors.
Especially the experts and those with the necessary functions, there is no employee satisfaction in.
Inflation is devouring
To the one who possesses the knowledge and experience.
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation is eating away.

This is indeed the simple idea, meaning, and this is how you put the simple idea and try to apply it.

Parallelism in the subject is present.

To address this issue, a genuine solution is required.

It means to make it worse.
We hope that this will continue for some more time until this committee proceeds.

Boredom will always be.
It worked, but the state also tried and raised the increases by forty percent.
Here is an important very point in the subject of increases.
You are on a topic of increases, you do not increase except for the Qataris, and as for those who are not Qataris, do they work for our volcanoes in Zimbabwe?
You are considering Qataris and not considering expatriates.
And it is the high percentage in it.
Hey Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not Germany.
She speaks about this topic and suffers.
Higher salaries than in the government sector by a lot.
And on the contrary, we saw.
On the government's side
And conversely, the government sector has become...
The best elements and competencies have become.
I also read a report and we know in QF the oil sector.
For labor
We are when we are like experts.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar.
And because we too interact with the global market.
For each of these things, the percentage increase, how much in salaries.
And the hope is with Allah, Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, but we say
The government there has a plan.
I would say controlling inflation is more important.
From the time treatment.
And we will see, me and me, I am sure.
There will be. **Explanation

And the opposite/And the other way around.
The huge belts that are in the country are also a part.
And if it were not for these huge, enormous conveyor belts and huge projects...
In the country, it also did not have a part in the inflation.
This too contributed to inflation.
And this also led to an increase in liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the correlation between the US dollar and oil.
Oil was bet against protection from.
Therefore, stability in governance is something that means.
Thank you.

A true, successful episode with a good title and a winning story.
What I would like to touch upon is that the region now, under the shadow of America's current policy...
America's policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural influence it exercises against Islam, is part of a global, economic, world war.

The American deficit also reached with Japan sixty-one billion dollars.
Japan had also invested in 2000.
With America, it's equivalent to nine.

The text "كما ان ملفات عصيه" translates to: **"As the files are rigid."**
She was concerned with being the driver of these files, not the size of Qatar.
The smallest Arab country.
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundations and rules that the State of Qatar's foreign policy is based upon.
For whose benefit.
The small state of Qatar, geographically and demographically, fulfills these significant roles.
What are the qualifications that enable her?
And that was in a direct conversation with the Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact the program's phone numbers, which will be shown successively on the screen.

The roar of cannons, Al Jazeera channel, a desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, from a Saudi coup attempt on the Emir of Qatar, in cooperation with members of the Al Marrah tribe.

What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the things that
I don't think it's accurate.
The precise translation is: **"Al-daqiq ino ana fi akthar min muqabalah hena fi hatha al-barnamaj kuntu daa'iman aqool"**
And we consider it the backbone.
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then, indeed,
And difference of views / perspectives
I created an issue regarding the borders, which is correct, and this was a major obstacle.
Historical Saudi-Qatari relations are distinctive.
These relationships, if we had observed them closely,
between the two families and between the two countries
It was marred by some misunderstandings.
Neither from our side nor from their side.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And so, now, the relations are in a situation that I can confirm is excellent, very good.
For the benefit of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
But how was the situation of Al Jazeera channel with Saudi Arabia resolved? It was the obstacle or the reason that led in the year 2002.
In an important point.
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, I would always say.
Not only the eldest sister, but I was saying that we relied on the Gulf Cooperation Council on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
and our relations with it, we give it importance
There was an exchange of media fire, and this was clear to both parties.
These countries found themselves.
Failed when the Brotherhood agreed.
The Qatari, Saudi private household.
More precisely, they found that the people involved had entered into a dispute.
They have neither camel nor goat in it.
And I don't think it was a strategy by anyone involved in this dispute.
But Sheikh, allow me, allow me here in this framework so that things or points are above the letters.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera, in the past two years, **[END TRANSLATION]**
At a time when the situations that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen still existed.
By the conditions within Saudi Arabia.
Whether it's people arrested, opponents, or others, the situation is still ongoing.
The satellite, Al Jazeera, stopped addressing these matters.
Until the Al Jazeera coverage of the Hajj changes.

This strategy continued and strengthened, first through the stability of the region.
The area refers to the Gulf region.
The Gulf region
There are many skilled fragments in the Gulf region.
Also, an appeal by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
It had an impact on all the societies and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about settling and overcoming Arab
It's not just about perspectives.
No, it is in the policies, and policies are points of view.
A number in the Arab world is considered to be this.
A type of war
While in the developed world
It speaks of the same interest.
Now you have remained for several years.
The current situation now. The current situation now.
Look first.
There is a complete difference between this topic and that topic.
The idea that a small country can strike at the great powers and make them feel vulnerable in its presence.
Every disagreement or every misunderstanding.
He had his reasons.
And its reasons ended.
His rule was ended by the two commanders.
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees for the between the two parties.
On the basis of the love, brotherhood, and mutual interest that unite the two countries.
And the commanders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And we hope much of this relationship, the Qatari-Saudi relationship, will develop.
For the better, and for there to be great areas.
For this relationship, just as we have a model B with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Qatar is an important country.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
Egypt is what, even noting that at the same time you reconciled with Saudi Arabia, Qatar sees it as?
And three organizations are Hezbollah.
He is Al Jazeera channel.
Or, on the system in Egypt, the largest of the Arab countries.
First, let me start with "ba", the following start.
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian nation.
and her concern
With many Arab pieces and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people.
This is an issue.
Someone believes that this is an issue where we want to enter through an entrance for for understanding or misunderstanding with the brothers in Egypt.
Amidst this, amidst the sense that you are interpret
And we believe that Ahura is a good person.
We disagree with Egypt on two points.
or a point
We threw him into the fact that we prepared the coup in Gaza, and I don't think...
And we do not interfere.
Regarding fragments concerning other countries.
Do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state, except if there is a scope for reform.
It means that there has been no intervention by you in the coup that was carried out by Hamas against the authority in Gaza.
"طبعا مش ان في اصلا احنا لم نعرف عن هذا الا مثل ما اعرفوه الباقيين من وسائل الاعلام"
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt differ or have a disagreement between you and it at this point?
This one I am coming for.
Hezbollah plot
Hizbullah plot and also.
But I am talking about my country.
We were very surprised by this topic.
If it shakes for Qatar's benefit.
The translation of "الاهرام الت ايه" is: **What is the Pyramids?**
Reached, she said the Al-Ahram.
To undermine Egypt and its position.
May I reply?
Subject: Let's return to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this topic.
Not from the Gaza conference.
And I justify, I exonerate from it the Egyptian people, I exonerate from it President Hosni Mubarak.
If we go back far enough to the Harbour Conference.
After the Madrid Conference, you remember the port where it was held in Doha.
This was an agreement when the conference was to be held here.
They said that we do not want to attend or hold the conference.
Folks, we know you have ties with Israel.
From Qatar, and this thing.
What is it that we want to understand?
We sat and went, we talked and the talk is always good.
It has two parts.
What are they?
There is a dispute.
The political orientation
When we come to the conference, what happened in Gaza.
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the Presidents, among them his brother, His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
And we received word from a foreign country.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt have a point of view on this subject, that it is complicated.
And they kill people while we watch.
If you do not want to listen in Doha, we hold it in any place, in the Arab League.
And it is shameful that on the margins of the Kuwait conference, I have to discuss an issue.
By Israel, and the Western world stands by, watching the matter.
When we came, we said okay. Now this is going on and there is no power or strength. We, the Arabs, cannot stop it. Not even a major power has been able to stop this fighting.
Egypt announces a request to halt hostilities in Gaza, which began hours ago.
Even us
We should not take Arab Street with this naive approach. This is where our disagreement with the Brotherhood lies in a single point.
This is in accordance with international customs.
And hospitals were not enough, the doctors stood on the borders.
You stood at the border.
There was, and no one could enter.
The brothers became very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a humanitarian issue.
And we respect Egypt's sovereignty.
And we know her position, but this does not reflect the Egyptian position.
And we are hopeful for a lot in Egypt.
She is the largest Arab country.
And what we believe she can convey is not only our voice but also the voices of others in the Arab world.
To all other parties.
Even the rescue operation after it was too late.
What the Europeans tried to save there.
What happened in Gaza from a conference.
Whether a donors conference and also I consider it a government rescue.
We did not invite to a conference, we invited for coordination between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
And we met in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
It will be spent.
To the suffering parties in Gaza
Directly, and this was
Because entry is forbidden from all directions.
I, along with the people of Qatar, rejoice in Egypt because Egypt...
Victory for Egypt in political matters is important to us.
But you are anticipating.
Give me, just give me, just two minutes.
One of the ministers proudly announced what had been saved and said
Whoever dares to outbid Egypt, we will cut off their feet and break their arms.
By God, I believe this official has wronged his country.
No, they didn't fail, and they weren't able to speak except about themselves. If we come to the truth.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"What helped them in this and this, I said right to our brothers in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia intervened because the King has wisdom in this matter."**
The core of matters in the Arab world.
We agree.
The king decides that this is the interest.
We are accepting the King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
But if someone says we prevented them, even if it was an insult from those who prevented them.
It was as if they were students in a school.
I mean, I think this.
The sharpness has reached its limit.
He believes that Ahura must be exerting His power.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this subject.
If they believe that a small country has no right, that right has been withdrawn from them.
You are entering, putting your nose in Darfur.
Arab League decision at the Arab League university.
African and a decision from the United Nations.
I think the main problem
Hizbullah's conspiracy to clean up Qatar has been exposed.
A plot, I don't know what, Qatar.
I mean, if SARS started, perhaps after the swine flu if it broke out somewhere, its cause would be a train. Maybe it's spreading the epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its place and its capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
Qatar, if it is able to resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because of the Arab world's differences.
Any Arab dispute, we believe, makes our position weaker in front of our main issues, which are Palestine and the rest of the issues we face.
The Arab world has become a passive recipient.
Even our analysis has become the same as your analysis.
Western تحليلات
While Shana, we know him, he knows what happened in Pakistan.
By God, I really want someone to receive me, to lay out a red carpet for me in Washington.
Has anyone scolded Qatar?
Has Qatar committed an offense against any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
What is it possible for me to command, saying "Peace be upon you," and for you to tell me, "You too be upon you peace," in order to annoy me?
This is a second issue, it means you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This is an issue that concerns you, not me.
But if you have an internal problem.
Always say it.
And, especially after the address of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know this man, he is honest.
And a man, what he says is what he reveals.
This is a tricky one because it's a mix
This is the same talk I always say.
I always say it at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia. I used to say these words.
And go back to all the documents you have on Al Jazeera, but...
The issue differs.
From one side, we said no, that's it, we stop at this point.
And we tried as much as possible.
I don't want to get into this topic.
Do they see their matters, do they see their mistakes, where
Let's see our own mistakes. It's not that everything we have is perfect.
This appears to
To the presence of internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Qatar denies any relationship with any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally, and has severed its relations with Turkey or other countries.
By God, we have a superhuman ability.
And they, mashallah, are seventy million. If we are able to stand, eighty.
They also have a problem that they must address.
You played a role in the Qandil Shalit case, despite knowing that this file is an important file for the Egyptian government.
And I sought with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "In the issue we are seeing, we said, 'O brothers, this is what the Egyptians call it.'"
We want to see this topic, please.
By Israel and another country, we saw that a prophet will see a third party, and this topic will be seen.
When we saw this topic, we told them, "Brother, if it's the same conditions that we, the brothers, are speaking about with the brothers in Egypt."
And this we announced, meaning, meaning, there is a responsible person who says, "We, meaning..." "Laugh at all the Arab world."
By God, this means, it means, poor soul.
I mean, how did he get away with it?
That President Mahmoud Abbas remains.
And we extend this hand.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your end.
I think, I think, this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island, as you accused.
And Al Jazeera must enter the media competition, as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets, and during the teenage years, all of them are الشتائم بعظهم.
But after a period, they reach a stage of maturity.
Maybe, maybe, and no.
First, we are with Saudi Arabia, and our position differs.
Even if we compromise with Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relations.
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a specificity in the relations between Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
and also the privacy of Egypt with any Arab country, Egypt is the major power, the largest.
This is true, this is true, but with Saudi Arabia, in history and in a relationship that differs.
It is a personal disagreement between officials here and there.
We respect the Majesty of the Egyptian President.
I hope it is confined to a difference in policies, in viewpoints.
I told you there was a problem when an attack happened on Gaza.
The second problem is that what is important to them, for us it is a sensitivity that we have not yet discovered from anything that Qatar does or similar.
Why don't you now seek to arrange a meeting with the Egyptian President, between the Prince?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And as the newspaper swarm was saying, first they had a secret meeting, then they found it the day after.
I was informed that a meeting took place between myself and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
His flock, no return.
And I can't tell you that we have agreed on everything.
Let's say in order to not have anyone explain that no, you are comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity whether it is for a young person or an elder.
The Minister, if Egypt were to obtain appropriate satisfaction, satisfaction.
The translation between children.
I don't think this is Egypt, the biggest Egypt, bigger than this. I think it's a case of expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you just holding the Egyptian people waiting for a divine intervention?
This, this, please, I don't want to talk about heaven's intervention and such, because God knows who lives and dies.
Here I am, I pray.
He was led to believe there would be a method.
And our pride is in Egypt.
It appeared that a certain path must be taken.
Either you stop with me, or you stop against me.
Any citizen of the Arab world will suffer in it.
We in the Arab world are pained by him, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of strength. China has sources of strength. France has sources of strength. A small state, such as Qatar.
By God.
What is clear is that there is nothing in it.
This is all just nonsense. You are...
But we are a small country, with all due respect.
And I repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say that we are allergic.
No one of us will confiscate it.
You have now, for Israel, tickled.
Before I go to Israel.
What is your vision for resolving the issue with Egypt?
What is the problem, they weren't the first.
And every day they file a complaint against America. If I tell you about the major countries you are talking about?
They deal with us out of a sense of duty, and we deal with them out of a sense of duty. الشرح: This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Arabic text. It highlights the reciprocal nature of the 'out of a sense of duty' dealings.
All complaints and all...
To sabotage the relationship.
I believe it detracts from any major power that does so.
And it also diminishes our Arab pride when we go running, complaining about each other.
Everything comes and everything is known.
Our vision is to be based on Arab mutual interest.
And we are with them in whatever they do.
Are there any upcoming steps to fix the relationships?
But I know that there are intimate relationships between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If it was one of the people who stirred up things.
Against the rapprochement of the two countries and the two leaders, he will find himself a loser because in the end...
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe ten years from now. I swear, I don't know, like, we're from... from our side, always, any person inviting us to a conference, we attend.
Anybody who invites us to a conference, we will attend. And if we have an opinion, we will express it in the conference.
ما we can we
Because Egypt is our eldest sister on any topic, but we have a point of view and we discuss.
This is all that is required. When the time is right, we will proceed. Of course, we are pleased with this outcome.
It was cancelled due to this policy shake.
And we, as I mentioned, respect the Egyptian people.
Certainly, here is the translation of the provided text, along with the answer to the last question: **Translation of
But our state's policy, we are, as I told you, the Egyptian people are close to us in Qatar, from our heart, very much.
Now, on June 4th, you toyed with the emotions of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office on June 4th. Your Arts Network published this on June 4th.
Why are you saying we tickled them? We wouldn't tickle them. For the last 12 years, we have closed it.
When Shannen was, everyone was carrying Shannen before they reconciled with Israel and before the meetings became secret between the do and some of the arab states with israel.
And after, and after, and after what, and after what, they reconciled. Most Arabs.
Whether under the table or above the table, with Israel, or they spoke with it in any capacity.
If we want to tickle emotions, we tickled them in the previous Islamic Conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's advocate, Nasser hosted a banquet at the Israeli ambassador's residence, Chayim Besnadin, also known as "Benny".
Yes, he was an honored guest among many other guests present at a banquet, for which he did not know the occasion. This was done by the ambassador.
Because we at the United Nations sit next to each other with Israel, meaning there is no one who can deny this topic.
Or, we found a glimmer of hope in the lifting of the distress from our brothers in Palestine.
Now the administration has changed, the matter is, Egypt was a small issue for me, but unfortunately...
I didn't raise him, you raised him.
My question is about the United States, the new administration, and the impact of that on your relationship, the Qataris, with the United States given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There is disagreement in viewpoints.
He is serious about solving many cases in the area.
And if they are serious, we will help them to the greatest extent.
Expects a distinctive relationship or a solution to the problems that were existing between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And Iran, you have distinguished relations with it, despite its poor relations with the United States.
First, look, I must put it in the internal affairs framework because we must respect every state and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections.
Before the elections, Saad al-Hariri, in this program, said that the Doha agreement ends with the establishment of the elections.
Has this vision of yours also made you see that the agreement is standing or that you will draw up a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for the phase that would lead them to the establishment of peaceful elections.
One and a half years have passed since the first round of elections, a little over a year, have passed since the Doha elections.
We were following it day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have influence in arranging matters in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon, you know, Qataris love Lebanon and go to Lebanon from… from… meaning
I mean, I am the first country that many Western countries Lebanon could have visited after.
Question: A quick answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi issue, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
or your intervention, at least, put them on an equal footing with the state. Now there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the south.
And we suffered from what we suffered. This is a return to why, when you stop here, why do you stop here? Is there a difference in Qatar?
And indeed, we faced many pressures regarding this topic. However, this was our vision, and this was His Highness the Prince's position on this topic.
The Houthi issue.
and its stability affects positively and its instability affects negatively upon us
Our intervention, BPo Po, was conducted through an impartial mediation between the two parties.
Or we signed an agreement.
But I understand that if this is meant to be exploited for other reasons,
And I would be with them there, and we always stood with them on every single topic.
And and and and it has no basis in health.
I see that we don't need to.
We sell it.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **Translation:** "And this is what I am saying while I am **not** sorry. I know that there is a large Arab audience that is **against** me."
As I thank you, our esteemed viewers, we sincerely hope for your diligent follow-up, and we sincerely hope that we have clarified for you some of Qatar's foreign policy.
Good evening, and a final greeting from the program's team. This is Ahmed Mansour, saying hello to you, without limits.
And peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.
Our esteemed viewers, peace be upon you, welcome to this special interview.
Ben Jassim bin Jabr al Thani, Prime Minister, Council of Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
"طبعا لماذا اقول مقابله خاصه واستثنائيه لان"
Qatar and this particular man were the primary sponsors.
My Lord, a simple and direct question.
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese decision from both sides was important.
To reach results
It is very important that external interference
Many opinions or suggestions from the outside.
Levantine Arabic, International. If you wish to say...
But it meant he went through phases.
There is nothing except for something that doesn't mean that these stages were not existing.
Does "an" mean "the complexities in Lebanon"?
Truth has been an issue for some time.
I mean, when you now met and got directly involved in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese knot is a major one?
A Lebanese Arabic regional international language requires significant codebreaking.
Is it small, simple, very basic, but was greatly inflated by intervention due to external involvement?
Because we know Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a lighthouse for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a lighthouse for many things.
Lebanese must not allow.
It affects the security and peace in Lebanon.
The number one problem.
External repercussions on Lebanon.
You decided suddenly, I mean, twenty-four hours after, to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane, straight to meeting the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect it, meaning they couldn't even rest for a single minute, unless perhaps you are the one to be so generous with them.
He is the secret, the secret, the secret. We will not let them rest or think too much.
And they make many connections, the secret.
Let's present an idea: to relocate them to Doha, because we need a climate.
Or will you gather them in many, various hardships?
And in many circumstances.
So, we brought them out for these circumstances, for the fact that you are coming to resolve.
If we want to succeed, we must move them away from this atmosphere.
And quickly.
Fear God, we are God, He guided us in the path of truth, the explanation, the explanation of the Venetian one or the Beirut explanation.
Then we were fortunate that he agreed and they agreed to go to Doha.
Both parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believe, for example, that Qatar is tilted towards one side against another.
And from Beirut, but
It means, according to His Highness the Prince, that if we are intermediaries...
In this process
Frankly, His Excellency Sheikh...
Did you genuinely consult?
With the two main parties involved, at least concerning what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Particularly the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
It means we benefited from Prince Saud by us
Everyone wanted a solution.
His excuses are weak.
If he leaves, if you leave, it's for the mind.
His excuses are weak.
It had to be removed because there are tensions in Palestine.
There is an issue regarding the Iranian nuclear issue.
I mean, the Arab League, it must have a mechanism for resolving issues.
The African Union is better than us in solving issues.
He tries to gather the sides.
And he holds conferences to solve the problem: why are the Arabs, whose institutions are ancient and established for years, unable...?
They should unite the Arabs or bring together the parties, if there are any, to intervene and support the oppressed.
He must study.
If we want him to be aware of the Arab League, not the world Arab League.
With him, the Arabic language is a tool for execution.
He was one of the officials here, the President Nabih Berri.
It requires X.
Now it becomes clear that the Lebanese have agreed.
I swear, look, I mean, we are...
First, Qatar.
It never led to a result.
For Arabic's sake.
He is a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it in several places.
At the United Nations, when we went in the Doha Agreement.
And the agenda should be a solution to the topic, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that.
And the most important role they have in the Arab world as a whole, in particular.
In a state
We stop it by our agreement.
Come, help us.
Because this is a dangerous topic and this is a dangerous topic, but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in the courtyard?
In our courtyard.
It is very important to overcome the interests of our peoples and people.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do between the brothers, the Palestinians.
What will we do in Somalia?
What will we do in Somalia, not a member of the Arab League?
Why don't we try, the the the Sudan, isn't a member of the Arab League, Iraq isn't a member of the Arab League.
We are a part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope that this is not just a suggestion, but an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I think that the first, if we are asked for something, we do what we can.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It can be a passing phase.
We find her, then, God willing.
Nevertheless, I am persistent in my question. If you permit, could you play a role in this aspect?
Even if not publicly, now you mean you possess some form of trust.
We seek any rapprochement between the Arab states.
And this is the policy of His Highness from the beginning, but I mean this subject.
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is about to witness serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is local, Lebanese, regional matters that are still ongoing.
Not sticking too much to this situation.
I wish for the opposite. I wish that this...
His state, the beginning of a new state in the Arab world, this is a wish.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
Meaning, in other words, the Sheikh's state, does it fear that the escalation that existed before a while
At least from here to the end of President George W. Bush's term.
There is nothing, there is no doubt, I am the one, the obsessions still remain with me, whether in the topic of Palestine, meaning now the topic of Gaza.
It means we, I, want to ask.
We don't want anything else.
He orders me to pay attention to this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
What we can reach for them is medicine.
Food
Electricity for the patient who is in the hospital.
The one who, if the electricity goes out, doesn't...
I mean, I wish.
We, as the Arab League, agree on an amount for this subject, medicine and food, which we will call medicine and food.
Brother, we don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But excuse me, the Arabic side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I do not want to get into the details of this topic. I am only saying that we as Arabs must deliver the medicine and the food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
Saudi Arabia has made an effort and pledged to restore the Kaaba in Mecca.
Because this is a disagreement, only the other party will benefit.
Do not deal with this party because we will find a solution for you. This is not true.
And I
Until now, I don't have any prospects for a solution in front of me.
Do you fear facing off against the US and Iran in the upcoming period, or are you bringing it?
This is expected, of course, we are.
At least I can talk about the state of Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
Qatar, they might not agree on every policy, or they themselves might not agree on every policy.
They, for example, tell us that we do not wish for your relationships with Israel or your contact.
Perhaps there are those who consider you to be necessarily a party through American rules located there.
This topic, we know how to deal with it.
There are those who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia...
He met, consulted, or spoke with the Saudi family.
In Istanbul, negotiations are ongoing between Syria and Israel.
It's as if I can say it by pure chance.
The second topic, the Kingdom was keen to find a solution, and I was communicating with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours.
Change tactic change tactic negotiations
Before you or before the parties.
We, as those responsible for this.
And from you, from all sides, and we locked ourselves in the room.
And finally, we found ourselves, and then the intervention of His Highness, the Prince, was important.
And some of them led to the invention.
The translation is not prov
And it was a clear message when he said, "We know our size and location, and our role and so on." It was as if...
He wanted to play the role of Munnun without provoking any other party.
Whether Arabic, regional, or international.
But nonetheless
It became his responsibility.
You wanted that or you didn't want that.
It means that some jealousy, some of the things that we want to avoid jealousy because we are as a country.
These are the countries.
You can work or...
I think this is the Bacon the combination the comfortable.
Perhaps a final or penultimate question: Your current relationship with Washington D.C. Is it a relationship that is lukewarm, extended, or distinctive?
I mean our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me tell you.
It does not be devoid of the fact that there are different points of view on various issues.
But this is our right, and if they are talking about democracy, this is what democracy is.
How is it good, meaning how would you translate it on the ground as being good, your relationship with...?
It means that if you are talking about economics, it is excellent. If you are talking about education, it is excellent.
If you are talking about health, If you are talking about politics, then I can tell you it's fine.
In your opinion and with complete clarity, during the next phase.
In my opinion, we should leave the issue of facing Israel.
And if we want to stop the scene of playing in the Arabic scene.
We will mend the relationships between the Palestinians.
We agree on an opinion so that we can become a respected force.
I don't think that we have.
That we will be something effective.
Thank you, our esteemed viewers, for your kind attention and until we meet again, God willing, with my appreciation to you.
Welcome to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
in this dialogue
We are trying to foretell the Arab political reality and the Arab efforts.
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue, we will be able to
Let's shed light on some of your questions.
The entry of Israeli forces into Gaza in a land-based manner.
and our goal was to have an Arab position
Her dealings with friendly nations.
And the sister states
And how to try to find a strong clear Arab position, with the Arab states...
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country was violated.
Arbitrarily
And no one was held accountable while.
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists.
In the only ones who are always our target.
We always discipline in a manner.
I think what
To the extent that we will not be able.
We will meet at the level of leaders.
Stop the campaign, it's disciplinary, we are the
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal approvals.
By a two-thirds majority.
But the goal of the meeting is not
We hope it is correct, and that our view is wrong, because the goal
Solve the problem now is not the goal. Do not make a summit.
But is it going to be resolved for the blood of Palestinians?
What we asked for now, the ministerial one, does not cancel Qatar's request.
And the owner of His Highness also confirmed it.
In his speech, he emphasized that we are not Egyptians if the embarrassment is being in a Qatar. We are not Egyptians that it should be in a Qatar. The summit should be wherever it is.
An Arab position, respected by others.
Yes, as for the ministerial...
So, we want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was issued.
and Israel
She was not concerned with the decision, and she continued, and is still killing and shelling in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs, "What are we doing?"
What are we doing?
Has Israel ended after?
The remaining part of the Security Council resolution will be implemented.
Or could there be a situation since Israel has not stopped
We do not shoot, we do not force our brothers.
Based on a decision, it is considered that fate has...
From a few days ago.
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You ultimately support this proposition.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea, and the idea of several other Arab countries as well. The Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen, and other countries requested the summit.
Already there is an Arab rift existing.
Or, all of us, we were sorted into the camp of moderation.
And a camp of not being moderate.
And the lack of moderation, what do they mean by it?
Those who distinguish us from the west.
Moderate Arabs, whom they call moderate Arabs, and Arabs who are not moderate.
What we find is that there is an moderate nation and an unmoderate nation.
And then we want to know what moderation and lack of moderation are. Is moderation walking with Israeli plans?
And and the conclusion of the case in an humiliating manner.
Or, it could be that we simply need to keep the issue alive.
This means this is an important question.
الموضوع يعني هل الدول
It walks through Israel's plans and wants to solve issues in ways.
I am not saying that it is following Israel's plans, and I do not want to accuse anyone.
But I say
What if we call it an "moderate camp"?
What is moderation, in the West's view?
Do we agree to slaughter a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, there were elections that took place.
I am not among the supporters or non-supporters of Hamas, but rather I speak of reality.
The existing reality is that there is
Thought
Some of what they call the Rediculous Movement
But we must ask ourselves, what is this radical movement asking for?
Something is her right, or is she claiming her right?
Or should we sort them?
And we also create other blocks.
against because we are
داخلي عربي فكري
This seemed to be happening.
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, your excellency Sheikh, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab Summit from being held?
I cannot say definitely there are, as there are interpretations and everyone has their say and the topic means it's well known.
Prohibition subject
But the, as I mentioned to you, we were possible
We take a vote and bring in two-thirds.
But what it was, this goal, it wasn't just a challenge, it was an urgent issue we believe is
I believe it is an unurgent matter.
Okay, we went to the Security Council.
To a decision of the Security Council.
But the decision is with the Security Council. Israel said, "Yes, it will continue, and then it will consider the matter."
All I want is to focus on it again.
What will we be, not striving in the application of the decision to the weaker party?
How will it differ from the first meeting?
The topic of disputes means a situation that usually involves disagreements and different perspectives.
As important as it is.
Are we ready to have a clear Arab position?
From humanitarian aid.
From the supporting, our brothers clearly.
And also, addressing the Palestinian side, I'll tell him...
This should be something we look into, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab initiative?
The then forty-eight and we are committed, we committed to the truce, forty-eight, and the Israelis did not commit.
It is natural during meetings for disagreements to occur. However, the reality is that these disagreements...
It expresses positions that express what is contained in the souls of certain people, meaning
One of the disputes that he learned about is
There are those who describe the Hamas movement as a "bastardization."
Not even fry it.
This is a situation that happened, and we responded to it. I, or rather one of the ministers,
And I believe that this means what the West is saying.
That those are radical movements and these are a bunch of people and someone is saying these are like that.
And we don't want to be the men other than...
And that's why it always means, and I don't mean anyone specific by it.
Any foreigner they find.
or a Western country or Western countries you will find
From among the Arabs.
Yes, well, His Excellency Sheikh Al-
Invitation to a second ministerial meeting
By God, his supposed agenda should have only one thing.
Where are you Arabs from what is happening and what is their position, the 300-year nation, and what...
million israel soft
Which was issued upon which was issued a resolution of one thousand eight hundred and sixty.
The decision that was issued.
Israel did not implement it. Israel implemented it after the mission was completed.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation exerted an effort.
He thanks him for this decision.
We request Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel.
And if they are asked again, they will tell them, "We understand."
It's not the fault of the Arabs that if they...
If the matter is so, then Israel does not, does not question.
It is above international law.
This is reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the convening of an Arab Summit to what would be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the UN Security Council will be seeking for us.
He needs a difficult decision.
to a decision
May someone be held responsible for losing their position.
We, the West, are scared.
And we, among those who testify, note that after they decide, for example,
I don't want to get out of the topic.
Those who carried out this assault are solely responsible for the complete reconstruction of Iraq, at their own expense, as they themselves destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government, and not ask the people who died.
There are no compensations.
Exactly the same thing in Sudan, as soon as they started talking about trying Al-Bashir.
His Excellency the Sheikh
His Excellency Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the UN Security Council.
He looked, there were difficulties for them in the Security Council because it was the beginning of the discussion on a presidential statement.
The consequences.
Israel did not comply with it.
You will commit in two days, in one week, after you finish the task.
Because they did not adhere to the decision.
Excuse me, people should adhere.
Because Israel accepts after finishing the mission.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All that we did
We unfortunately carried out some actions on some brothers, out of their own initiative.
The siege of Gaza, they participated in it.
I am a friend of the West and I have no objection to having a relationship with the West, and I am not...
Neither against the West nor against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Friends, if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, our point of view is taken from one percent, and we say that we have triumphed.
What is victory?
As to what it includes.
I cannot now say any reservations because the decision is not.
And the council is sovereign over itself.
You participated in the formulations.
We will share with you in the formulations to a certain extent. Yes, we shared with you.
But you did not invite to a meeting the Arab ministers with his American Secretary of State.
But I am sure the brothers who went are enough for us.
I pointed out Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this field, His Highness Sheikh
Since two years ago until now.
Look, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't claim that we have an overview of everything.
Are they people?
An Israeli rejection and an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here, the dispute began, and the siege was established.
And Israel, in the past month, killed during a truce, twenty-eight Palestinians.
And they prefer to be hungry until we exhaust them, because we don't want them to be in power.
Those are the parties, Your Eminence the Sheikh.
She clearly states that the dispute is Palestinian-Palestinian.
it means if there was
Who created the Palestinian dispute, or was there a Palestinian-Palestinian dispute?
We will tell the party, "No, you are absolutely right."
I am not saying that Hamas is completely right.
I do not claim that, nor do I say that.
But May is typically a median that lies exactly halfway between the two middle numbers.
And I don't just mean the mediator, I mean us, as Arabs, to be at an equal distance from everyone.
And we don't want it to be present, so we must end it by any way.
During the training of right-wing and left-wing forces.
And once by besieging them, not giving them money or salaries.
And once we create a positive model in the Western context.
We will let the people in Gaza see how people live.
Living a comfortable life, a life of luxury.
Here's the translation of the provided text, presented as a single, unadorned output: In Gaza, the opposite of this is the case.
You invited them to a second ministerial meeting, a second Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time.
Talk about it is still ongoing, taking place between Hamas with Turkish mediation.
This meeting, to which you have invited us, seems, as if it were, an attempt to circumvent.
If we were to take another initiative, the preemption would be lost.
We don't have initiatives.
In this topic
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
And it is required of her to play a role, and we are here to support any Egyptian effort that leads to reaching an understanding.
But it is important.
We do not come.
Tomorrow, on the edge, as if he had won over the other side.
And the path to harmony?
An Egyptian initiative, weighed.
Between the requirements of international standards, the requirements of the Arabic language, and the requirements of humanity.
And the requirements for Egypt's role, which is an important role.
هي a leading Arab nation that we respect and appreciate.
This, this is what is required, in your opinion regarding Egypt.
His Excellency Sheikh
I have a perception about the initiative.
Whatever was announced, we hear from here and from here about it, information.
I cannot comment on something I don't know.
With respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, it must be present, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But also, there are people.
We are waiting at the edge, we must take their perspective.
So that we can, this mediation succeeds.
By the way, take the point of view.
The position of Hamas was clear that this decision was not taken with our opinion in mind, meaning how could it be issued.
A decision in which Arabs participate in its formulation without having contact or seeking the opinion of the primary interested party on the matter.
We only want... I mean, of course we deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with it, the authority, let's say as a single, distinct party.
But now there is a schism. In one place, a party is present, and in another place, a different party is present.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we will fall from our dealings with the group that are present in the West Bank or the Palestinian Presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as a people and as a single government.
If they ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
Now we started to coordinate together.
It was not announced, it was not announced about it.
First, the decision is not to tell him, he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered that it formed for them.
This is an interpretation, but based on my reading of the decision, it seems he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in performing
Stops the fighting.
What am I, to doubt them, my brothers, in Egypt?
Because Israel did not accept the decision of the Security Council.
And you consider that this decision has become as if it no longer exists, since Israel has not accepted it.
Even if you accept it later, things will have changed on the ground.
Yes, Your Eminence the Sheikh, to discuss the Egyptian efforts.
She is also sharing efforts with her, also at the same time.
عن a Arab inability
Regarding inter-Arab disputes that cannot reach a solution, thus came to occupy a place.
I mean, it was supposed to be occupied by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's position.
And a position that must be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country
And therefore, this is the natural role.
And if people must follow, then...
There is no Arabic consciousness to address the situation.
Let them finish the task.
A clear and unequivocal Arab position must be taken regarding this aggression, its continuation, and the procrastination involved.
For him to be in a similar Arab position.
It means Israel is able to move its people into the villages. I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are among the people who advocate for peace always.
We are a country that means you want to live in peace.
But I am not asking for an Arab war, I am asking for a stance.
Arabic, clear
In the context of talking about initiatives and proposals, of course you follow what is happening.
And the proposals and conditions that the Hamas movement sets.
Do you think
As an AN Reality Field Observer
And the political outcome of the military operation, now allowing Hamas to impose its conditions.
The necessary is to be the right one.
Here are the approvals, the point is we agree with you
The second thing
They are not present now, they are negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing
Okay, in the required situations, from the Arabs.
This is the Arab reality.
What we witnessed following the start of those operations.
Doubt exists that a situation on the Arab street is significantly, significantly, more advanced than...
about us as governments
Of course, I am sorry that some people describe this situation, this wonderful, this popular, this folk situation.
They used to tell me about this topic.
We represent the views of our peoples.
The presidents are now.
It means if they want.
At least they can see something.
It claims, of course, there is a high ceiling and there is a modest ceiling.
Normalization, the cessation of diplomatic relations and exchanges with Israel, must be halted.
Qatar bane
The Israeli embassy office in Doha will close.
Qatar which is taking this position.
The Arab side must be radical and take fundamental positions.
Anything that the Arabs agree upon, we will collectively agree upon.
If there is an Arab agreement, then we will.
The treaty is one thing, and the relations are another.
We are ready.
We align ourselves with our Arab brothers.
But for there to be a decision and clear Arab credibility,
And they deal with outsiders, not just the countries that have relationships.
Even countries that have no relations.
Very important
We will not be agents for others.
Why is Qatar not a model in this field?
If this is the only model, we are willing to be in it.
But we also want.
Arabs model, Qatar commits part of its Arab commitment.
like
And no one will go and sell, until everyone.
Our problem is the trust between Arab states, which is missing.
And I don't want to tell our secret. Unfortunately, I don't want to say it to the brokers.
Therefore, it is very important.
Let it be an official invitation wherever it may be, because we should elevate ourselves above this.
Some استدعت the Ambassador, some made protests, some were expelled, like Shafei, for example.
and this is part of the disagreement
But some of them called the ambassador, and those who called them always had permanent membership. There are five ambassadors, and this, this, all of these are movies about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling for the popular demand.
With the highest ceiling, there are those who demand, with B, the opening of fronts. There are those who demand Syria to open its front with Israel.
Look, I told you, we call for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not demand an engagement with Israel.
To fight with Israel.
And how will we agree?
This is not a problem either.
What we were left to talk with each other, to overcome our differences, to
You piqued me, His Excellency Sheikh, when you said that.
Provided that the countries do not sell each other.
What do you mean?
It means now.
The street will have no mercy for us.
His Excellency the Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the war in Lebanon?
Does she consider that there is a difference?
No, I think there is a difference between the goals.
Means Lebanon had free land that was liberated.
The remaining parts, of course, are under the ... (translating the rest of the input is beyond the requested output format). It is assumed to be a deposit with the United Nations.
Or something like that.
Lebanon means we dealt with the Lebanese issue to a large extent.
Israel of course needs surrounding weak countries.
Even if it appears to be in control, it is actually the one with the upper hand.
And of course, there are countries that are supported by foreign powers.
Therefore, she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want...
Will they change this example in Gaza?
In Lebanon, you speak with several sects.
And how many a place/thing.
While Lebanon is dying, in Palestine they speak of a single entity.
But I reiterate to you that the problem of the Palestinians is that they listened to the Arabs too much and to the foreigners.
From here, the atmosphere changed, and everyone believes they will control the other party.
In your opinion, as a supervisor and monitor.
As planned, it ends with a bone fracture.
We as Arabs, do we accept this? Because this example might repeat for those who are difficult.
Or he may state his opinion.
For whether for Israelis or others, the future.
And we gave an example.
The highest in obedience and in helping to break a bone.
I am what I mean, in a proverb we have: I and my cousin are against the stranger, and I and my brother are against my cousin.
We are now supposed to have any disagreement with Hamas, and I am not saying Hamas or anyone else is infallible or immune from error or authority.
They all have mistakes.
Now I must not pass this subject.
This appears to
Because here, failure will be, not the failure of a class.
His Excellency Sheikh Qatari, it usually means since a period of time, and it has been taking the initiative to present proposals.
And initiatives to resolve occurred in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur. We will talk about this subject, meaning this topic, even if it's a quick one, a little later.
That we
We do not want to burden our brothers because there is sensitivity on occasion.
From any state that undertakes all these initiatives, we have no objection, the important thing is to solve the matter.
This appears to be a stream of consciousness or fragmented text, possibly in a non-standard dialect or code. It is difficult to provide a precise translation without more context or a clearer understanding of the underlying language system.
It means it was not one of His Highness Prince's objectives.
These were his objectives, how do we stop this bleeding?
And we stop this tyranny.
What happened, I mean, is beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is for us to have the intention.
The sincere one to reach a noble solution.
The talk about initiatives means it is beneficial to know where the initiative has become, regarding Darfur, the solution of the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum.
And it will be special to solve the problem of Darfur because the problem of Darfur started.
Arabs helped.
But once I ignite an issue, we reach it for international bodies.
Based on the information, we are going to take revenge against a system. Now, we want to resolve the issue, but we don't know how to resolve it.
And we always cite, as you mentioned at the beginning, in applying decisions. Meaning, we are the best people to apply decisions.
Diversion of the issue from competition, is there also competition in the subject of Darfur?
I don't want to discuss this topic.
Before we finish this conversation, Your Excellency Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will you hold this summit? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will boycott the summit.
We hope that it is held in different atmospheres than the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
It is a defect.
Okay, if he attends, if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When the blood of Palestinians was flowing in Gaza, and here they are gathering for financial and economic reasons.
I will help in igniting.
But it doesn't seem that anyone is afraid of whoever is on this street.
Do you know about the circumstances? I, of course, do not wish for anything to happen to all of us, only for safety.
And be safe.
But I mean, no one takes someone, it's in their little pocket.
The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, I thank you very much.
Our esteemed viewers, wherever you may be, peace be upon you.
So, what is the point of this celebration, and how true are the statements made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
And what about our Arab region and its extent of interest in this issue?
Here are the questions and others we pose to our guest for today's episode.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability.
She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Community Service and a Bachelor's in Sociology from Qatar University.
as well as for the Master's in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt
And many centers have been involved in the field of people with disabilities.
One of them is a founding member and the General Coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities.
Year 2000 and 1998.
And the Vice-Chairman of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities from one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine.
Until two thousand and three.
She also contributed to the establishment of the center for people with disabilities.
People with disabilities in Qatar.
Our female guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, campaigns, and media initiatives.
And the activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world.
She also contributed by giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Mrs. Husah, to this episode with you.
The approved term is individuals with disabilities.
In the beginnings, we called a person with a disability "disabled." This was in the eighties and before.
When there is more teaching.
It is located within those who provide them with that education.
On the ninety-third day, a significant document appeared at the United Nations.
Speaking of this term, before we delve into the details.
Compared to the rest of the regions, even though there are regions that are not classified as developed economies or are classified as developing economies and are classified as having low income.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, is a reality where this trend is perhaps stronger than in any other region.
But statistics proved otherwise.
The trend towards the legal aspect exists in the Arab world. You find it in many countries.
It is possible that the necessary resources exist and the political will is present.
Okay here let me tell you some statistics perhaps you of course are aware of them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Husah, how do you comment on these statistics?
She is truly to a great degree.
I saw first in Darfur, in Gaza, and in the regions that are exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, you do not distinguish between a disabled person and a nondisabled person, as the numbers are great.
Separating children, the illiteracy rate among females, for example, is around fifty-three or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching the schools, even if they do not have an disability.
The city originally has no infrastructure, even if this child exists and that school could be found.
That he can access it.
For the children and for other residents, that
Such like means these projects and agendas are wonderful but we don't hear that in reality often.
unless when we talk about the World Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago; what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world.
A better position than those individuals who do not have any disability at all.
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects.
He applies a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy.
There is an overlap between the humanitarian issue and working with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
Here's the translation of the provided text, focusing solely on the text itself as requested: In a degree of consciousness now in the Arab world, it is better.
At the point of consciousness, we pause to receive communications and continue our dialogue.
Thank you.
Here are two questions I would like to ask, given their historical context:
The second point, what is it?
The United Nations laws that call for, for example, fighting regimes that cause a hindrance to society and to the child. For example, my son, the Syrian Intelligence System.
Is there a law that allows me to file a request for court proceedings, as there are many people in Syria...
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Cro حدثنا from Syria. Thank you very much to you with us, Nayef Al-Saeed from Kuwait. Please, Nayef.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
Good evening
Good evening, please go ahead.
I, if you please, am from the group of people with intellectual and mental disabilities.
I mean, listen to Arabs saying, "The free man understands by the signal."
And in what the grains are said, say in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glorified be He who granted us speech, and granted speech to everything.
I sat for more than thirty years. Maybe I don't speak, meaning I say only one or two words per day.
Glory be to God. God granted me speech.
I mean, he was sitting, I talked about the Gran V, and I found, I mean...
يعني an attack on me for exploiting the Quran and for being a hypocrite, specifically referring to people and such.
They are defaming me and targeting me, and they are in the lowest depths, burning.
I have only gotten slander.
And they do not utter the word "Hagagah."
People whose homes are made of glass should not throw stones at people.
And disabilities, of course, psychological.
they fall within this definition, the question posed by Suleiman regarding...
United Nations programs, or their reactions, concerning the causes of disability, such as political objectives or others.
Approaching various organizations and agencies.
To discuss and convince it, and to know, sorry, to what degree.
There are topics and issues of disability on their agenda, meaning
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations originally focused on disability.
He is one of the programs that tries not to neglect children with disabilities.
Appropriate opportunities and schools.
From various environmental and other aspects.
So too UNICEF
But there are shortcomings that we must admit, that there are shortcomings in the situation with the United Nations as well.
The most prominent weaknesses and shortcomings that you talked about, what are they?
For the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy.
Directly, I was present in my country, in the state of Qatar.
But there was a routine and a bureaucracy that hindered.
It was particularly effective at times. I sometimes saw it while observing the limitations or shortcomings.
He struggles, or tries, and fights to have his disability recognized.
until it reached a somewhat satisfactory level, it did not put it in a separate material as it wanted, the global movement for disability
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no formatting between them.
This is one of the most important points of its weakness.
The survey applied by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States.
Within the staff or among the workers in those programs.
Unfortunately, we have only received three responses out of a total of eight and forty organizations and agencies. We have only received three responses.
Do not travel.
The issue of disability is permanent, stable, and continuous for many years, despite the fact that this issue is a fundamental human rights issue.
Yes, thank God, it was two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has become at least something that is discussed through events such as Seminars and others.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why don't there exist binding laws and resolutions for the Arab countries? And who is responsible for activating these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries specifically and allocating salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Is there money allocated from the United Nations?
And do these funds turn to governments or to offices belonging to the United Nations? And do these aid reach the disabled truly?
And a note in conclusion, if there are no binding decisions for the Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmad Al-Halabi, you spoke to us from Greece.
Mona Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, Ibrahim, please come in.
Assalamu Alaikum
And peace be upon you.
The adoption of this proposal.
It is when you write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
This box became transformed into this.
Or a manufacturing plant.
Allocate one percent of the net annual profit.
I return to our distinguished guest to address the questions of the callers.
And he says that the doctors advised him to undergo a surgical operation, but...
He incurs a lot and cannot afford to take on this... this... this process, whatever direction it takes.
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to address the needs of brother Naji.
Like any other rights, it means the rights of the disabled persons.
All these are rights that are incumbent upon him and that he must inevitably obtain, this citizen.
For the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal convention.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of persons within their national territory.
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations.
Binding for all countries, with oversight to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least, at the level of officials, first grade, there must be an awareness.
Then, at least if we work on these covenants in this way, it is indispensable. **Alternative Translation (emphasizing necessity):** This is absolutely essential.
Even if there is not a significant obligation
Was there an uptake of the reports for the monitoring you were undertaking, and was there an interest?
But do not forget, the standard rules are a binding, morally true document, in fact, not legally.
To be committed to and have a genuine belief in it.
And we understand that these cases will be resolved, discussed, or presented within the context of a society suffering from many problems and complications.
Naji Zakarni, Director of the Qatari Signs Center, Expert in Sign Language on Al Jazeera.
Mr. Ali began by extending his warmest thanks to Al Jazeera.
who kindly did, now, this special episode air, the one she broadcast, with thanks.
Now Ali speaks and says, "I am very proud."
She was a servant to all the people with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
And we support it and stand by its side always and forever.
and i also say that there are many people with special needs
Some of them do not know this agreement because there were no sessions for training.
Regarding it, especially if it is in schools, hospitals, or government and private institutions.
It is necessary that this agreement be published.
It is like a law that means people with special needs in all countries of the world.
This is absolutely and strongly urged that the states
It adopts this agreement and signs it.
similarly, like the State of Qatar and some other countries, they have signed this document. Its goal is to serve people with special needs and to serve us.
Thank you very much, colleague Naghi Zakarna. I spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you both very much.
Your opinion may make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability may start with the proposal presented by a caller, Ibrahim Abdullah, from Saudi Arabia.
About establishing a support fund.
It is a box for donations and accepts any contributions from countries.
This box is supposed to be used to fund activities that the Special Rapporteur will undertake when exercising his mandate.
And even Arab nations have not offered donations, except for one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, meeting those obligations is a problem existing within the United Nations.
The box which...
Regrettably, a lack of commitment from Member States and a lack of attention have unfortunately been the case.
And many say it unfortunately, with all means meaning the courage to be that we do not care now about the conditions.
It is a fact, a matter of obligations.
Regarding human rights.
The human with its overall wide shape.
The marginalized, in particular.
But that is why those covenants exist.
If he, may God have mercy on him, passes away, these countries will remain committed to their obligations, but it is a good idea that was proposed by the brother.
Add to it, it is necessary that there not only be a box, independently meaning in its independent form, but also the existing organizations in the region.
From her budgets.
He came to provide projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistants for people with disabilities.
The issue is always intertwined, meaning the political factors are involved.
His state or government significantly supported him.
The number has unfortunately decreased.
With symbolic amounts.
There is a disabled father.
Of course, I withdrew citizenship from it.
The girl withdrew from him, a girl about her age.
From time to time
Problems in teaching.
We travel or go outside, overwhelmed by a state of confusion.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
And we can.
Rebuilding their selves with knowledge.
I wish that the Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budgets...
Thank you very much, Bahgat. The krawan (crane) of Bahgat from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please proceed.
Assalamu Alaikum
And peace be upon you.
Good evening to you and good evening to her majesty Sheikha Bint Khalifa.
I just wanted to inform her of a message of thanks and appreciation.
Over the past years.
With our best wishes, we, the residents of Al-..., the family with special needs.
In their continued support, the Sheikha's sustained assistance for them.
Sha'b al-liwa' sharif min Tunis, ahlan bik.
The translation is not explicitly requested
I believe that there is a genetic level care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
There, in our Arab customs, it is always the case that the son of an uncle, the son of another uncle, takes his paternal uncle's daughter, the daughter of his paternal uncle's wife, to someone else, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability, and thank you.
The comment was "What came in what came, so viewers' connections."
The reality is, there is, as you said, at the national level.
Be aware that there are guidance and support programs.
It is located within the health services.
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
Within the mental health clinic, I also believe that in the education system, the programs of the Supreme Council for Education...
The special education department, I honestly don't know if it's still existing.
But certainly, it is within the health services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And facilitate his progress for these cases.
Prevention is indeed better than cure. He pointed to the factor of genetic inheritance. Marriages between close relatives. Are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this field.
Definitely, this is a very important and dangerous point.
And it is one of the things that I and others addressed in many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, not only are they directed.
The World Health Organization implemented it.
Likewise for UNICEF.
Now, in many Arab countries, and Qatar is among them.
And Tunisia is certain.
There are now binding decisions for early screening.
And which has been applied in many countries.
This is all on the preventive side.
And did such campaigns receive a response?
Positivity, especially when it clashes with customs and traditions.
Of course, this is how its difficulty lies: the collision with the societal culture.
To be in a decision to be in strategies to be in will that confronts that and is committed.
The issue of early screening, for example, this is a very important issue, not related to marriage.
Do you have any statistics that talk about people with disabilities?
Especially for the disabled in the Arab region.
Qais applied the Arabic region in meaning that
And especially
Given the recent events in the region.
In the areas and in the hotbeds of conflict in wars, regarding the wars, the conflicts and others.
Every dead person is interviewed by three handicapped persons.
Events in Lebanon, in Darfur, in many areas.
Never, it's not enough. First, the issue is me.
In accordance with the principles of human rights.
There must be a means, a situation for people with disabilities, their programs, and the plans.
Amidst the existing agendas in ministries, institutions, and governmental and non-governmental organizations.
In situations such as war or unrest.
Just your High Commissioner for Human Rights at the UN, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and even stranger than that, what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said regarding population statistics...
"Meaning, for this degree, the disabled do not fall within the general statistics conducted for the population."
He does not always declare.
For example, in the state of Qatar when the census was conducted, I believe it was for more than five years.
But honestly
In cooperation with the device, the Planning Council, and others.
The council presented it as a fact, with our participation, as the office of the Special Rapporteur.
To provide more context, more categories of disability could be introduced.
The needs that are supposed to be present in me.
The types of those things, all these important details that you absolutely must, will lead you to a result.
Is there someone who is disabled or not?
Completely, but at least.
Kind of, the statistics are making progress in this aspect.
Assalamu Alaikum
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you Sheikha Hessa.
But I thank God, and I praise Him that I, that I am Qatari, and I receive this interest from my country, I mean.
And my daughter is currently a student in the independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I want to thank Mrs. Hessa.
And its motivating role and its role that makes us not fear and not worry about our children.
And to God be the praise and thanks, and very great thanks to her, and to those who depend on these people, this group.
Thank you, thank you very much to you, Fatima Al-Dossari, you spoke to us from Qatar, we will remain in Qatar with to you, Latifa.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you.
My noble sister, the reality and the desired, which we await, for the problem of our children, the Bidoon, to be resolved.
Where is the Sheikha's role for our Qatari children
I hope it responds to it, responds to this question.
Peace be upon you
And I bear witness to what the State of Qatar was offering in terms of services, particularly for hearing disabilities.
We had a program for the early detection of hearing impairment.
There is the Supreme Council for People with Disabilities.
For persons with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even the civil society association, the M.G. Oz or communities, etc.
Because the reality and the desired outcome are, if I compare, within five years.
What was provided for the disabled five years ago, and now?
Thank you very much, Karim Nassim, you talked to us from Jordan, and I return to our guest.
Of course, the
The society as a whole, with its individuals, and in particular, the families that have...
Children with disabilities have ambitions and high expectations from anyone.
Whether it's at the planning level or at the executive level.
but regarding one of the points that was mentioned, which is a very important point
The children who cannot have documents or anything, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international agreement, like many international documents,
And a commitment to translate it into plans and strategies.
That the provision of those services is automatic.
From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, sex, or nationality.
Okay, Sheikha Hessa, I mean, I worked as a special rapporteur before, at the United Nations, specifically dealing with disability. After six years of work...
You were wishing.
Perhaps you didn't have enough time, perhaps the financial assistance wasn't sufficient.
I mean, there have been a lot of achievements that have been achieved, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations, and through the institutions of government in many countries.
In the Arab region specifically, I focus.
To have more research and larger studies.
We launched from a global survey that resulted in more than one report from us.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process, and work must be continually focused on it with significant effort.
Coordination between Arab countries
And among the people themselves, the people with disabilities and their organizations, because that is them.
But they, they have a duty that is inevitable.
They will fight for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our esteemed viewers, at the conclusion of this episode, I extend my gratitude to all who have shared their insights and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Join us by calling or messaging, in a new episode of "Live with..." until we meet again.
Morning of roses
I am very happy to have you with us.
At first, before we started, asking the various questions, and chatting away on this morning.
Thank you Shaimaa, maybe I congratulated
He deserves the whole Middle East for this global achievement.
Qatar really put us on the map of the world.
Thank you Qatar
Ali, you are honored, Ali.
First thing, good morning to the brothers watching.
And tell him congratulations on the hosting, and to the Qatari people in general.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said, it means...
Before a dream, and now God willing, it will be a reality and work will start from either today or during the announcement period.
You were expecting that Qatar would host the FIFA World Cup in 2022.
Despite the presence of strong files, meaning countries like the United States, Japan, and Australia, I was not apprehensive in this domain, in this particular subject.
No, look, this is what I mean, I'm being completely honest with you, seventy percent. I swear to God, that's it.
Our file is very big.
Really view actual global and competitive plans.
We were equal, meaning we were at the level of competition.
Why should we be afraid?
But thank God, the Qatar file was indeed strong and deserved that.
True, the file ofالفين and twenty-two and the World Cup and its hosting in Qatar
So what does that mean, in the, in the, in the mathematicians themselves?
This means a lot to them in this field, and the joy will definitely be very, very large, God willing.
I mean, I like it this way. We used to talk before the air, but I wanted to hear on the air like this.
In the moment of the announcement.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, the joy, how was the shock, I don't know, tell me, tell us.
on the radio
After everyone in the world, they are with us.
They knew the ad was fake.
How did you see the global mass media?
Look at the level of the sports channels as a whole, no one insisted, especially the Arab countries, I mean, thank God, everyone provided their support.
It's an advertisement anyway. Qatar's victory and its right to host is evident.
All Arab countries, and this is not strange from them, this generous gesture from them, now that they have announced their willingness, to Qatar, whatever it may be.
Media, from human resources, possible as volunteers, in the future.
Even at the level of external media, Chaimae.
It means that when I went to celebrate my bad luck.
He included them within the... He included them. The French News Agency also photographed.
We also have meetings.
Okay, here is the translation of the text, without any added explanations: **It means no one insisted in the first place, Qatar became it now, let me tell you daily, I remember.**
Hundreds of times a day, on a scale from the smallest speck of earth to the largest expanse,
I, I expect everyone will know, Qatar, for those who don't know Qatar on Earth, it's already gone, on the internet.
His friend, the World Cup in 2022.
means any football player dreams of serving his country, of being part of the national team
Sure, of course, any player whether in the Qatari league, meaning he wishes to represent the national team.
This means something positive, that one sacrifices himself, even in matches.
His hand is chosen even if he is successful and enters the national team, he gives everything he has.
It means whether in the exercises or the matches, because the national team's logo is on its chest, so it must put all it has.
By God, my inner circle, the officials, have not been remiss. Whether in their attention or in the players, especially the young ones, this means they are teaching them professionalism from a young age.
eating, sleeping, the
Tell me about your experience. You played in more than different stages, years. How was your experience, and where was the most important thing for you?
By God, it was indeed.
I was included in the phases of the national team, from the youth levels to the first team.
You know, camps with clubs, with the club, with the national team.
Each stage has its own special character.
Yes, Lana, mashallah, it means you were like moving from...
We are already used to you because of the sports.
When we see you, you are always like that, a riyadhi. We loved to take information from you and to know, to know the riyadhi news, through you, as in, what is the riyadhi news with you?
It means that I, honestly, don't watch it much. I enjoy it more than the variety shows. With the variety shows, we used to host stars, but within their fields, and we also did the sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and others before him in their athletic field.
In contrast, physical activity.
What's wrong, we were the capital of sports.
Qatar, and now we have become the capital of sports and global football.
Instead of when you are in variety shows, you present social, economic, cultural programs.
You have different fields. You have volleyball, basketball, and different championships.
Just then, some exercise.
Excellent, sweet.
I wished for honesty.
I wish it wasn't now, that my age was twenty-five, that my age was ten years.
I believe that the emerging players got an opportunity and a big opportunity.
And they hold it, meaning just like they say with their own hands.
Here's the translation of the provided text: **"It's good for me, God willing. The word I would like to direct to the players who..."**
God willing, it means it will happen. It refers to young novices who will have a promising future, God willing, in the coming days, by God's will.
Of course, I found this an opportunity and they must, I mean they have to, take advantage of it.
This means: "This is an opportunity that has come to you on a golden platter, they say."
They must be exploited more extensively.
What's new with you? What's your news? What, what's the new now from the programs that I will present? I know that we are a bit late with the preparations for the holiday.
So, tell us about your new things, God willing.
Will definitely be there, God willing. We will be preparing for the Asian Cup, starting in one month.
We finished just two days ago, the Gulf Cup. Appropriately, we are congratulating the Kuwaiti national team.
The news publication is also available, meaning it is accompanied by the intuition. We are sitting down, keeping up with the intuition.
Sure, I am a native speaker and a professional, very precise translator. I will translate the input
He did not initiate a denial of this known favor towards them, not at all.
Wow, mashallah, they transmit a message to the media on various channels.
Whether they are private channels or sports channels or other kinds of channels.
Thank you, may God grant you well-being, Qatar TV.
We definitely wish you the best, God willing, you will always have success. We are still in this topic.
First of all, I would like to thank the Al Wakra club's management for
And the fans of Al Wakra club, some of them...
My childhood and I in Al Wakra.
Sheikh who was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club.
I am still the son of Al-Wakrah and the son of Al-Wakrah.
Just like I told you before, this is professionalism.
Applies to everyone on the land of Qatar.
The young people, that's it. We know that young people like sports and are addicted, just like that.
How can we make a sports event that fits within the scope of listening?
Media awareness is primarily about media, very much a role in disseminating information across various media platforms. Let's say, in everyday life.
You have the youth addicted to it, but currently, sports have started to enter schools, and awareness of sports in schools has become a reality.
They have occasions to celebrate, any occasion, a sports occasion, they do no celebrations.
You have the Qatari street, meaning we will see, we will walk, the signs on the streets, this is also considered a sports awareness.
Female representation, when specialized, such as in the stands or any other location.
This is also a women's awareness, or let's say a sports awareness for women's participation in the sports field.
Then we have it now, we have the Qatar women's national team.
I imagine that sports, thank God, are starting to expand.
And I also expect it because the time period
To create many projects and raise awareness more significantly about the topic of exercise, and I expect this is a sufficient period.
If you study properly and work properly.
It is enough, and at the same time, it is necessary to take full advantage of it, just as it is.
Then there's a point where I wanted to take advantage, but how, and that's how the younger generations can be taken advantage of by the national team.
It means capabilities, expertise, devices, everything is available.
Even in his important work, it is a known fact, more pronounced within Gulf and Arab societies, that they overwhelmingly prefer physical activity.
How can I deceive this audience into consistently following for sports news, live match coverage, and events happening in Qatar?
And those attending, at the same time.
But you know, most Qatari people, they love sports, they love football, but the problem is with the attendance.
It means if you enter forums, you will find that interest is greater, especially in forums related to some clubs or clubs where their majority are.
Significant interest in football in the leagues.
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution you feel is most possible, even to attract you, for you to attend, for you to be a sports enthusiast, for you to be an athlete?
What's the best way they can follow on the A, watch your friends, your buddies?
it depends on the person themselves, not that is to say, as a general thought, or something.
Some of them like to watch it on TV, or I mean gatherings they hold.
I mean, for example, Japan, Japan has implemented a large-scale plan to attract a larger audience to attend.
When you attend the games, I collect points, I don't know what it means, it's worth it now to find solutions. So, God willing.
This appears
The most important point is that every player, God willing, will be present in Qatar, especially in the framework of the FIFA World Cup 2022. We ask, what do you expect we need?
What else, besides financial support, is there to improve? What is truly the most important need that is actually required?
And providing the means that might be available to the generation, truly, it is worthy of the Qatari national team's name and to participate in the biggest World Cup.
The time, when he told me now, the time that was about to end, when in my mind I was saying when, God, the time was finished quickly, with the beautiful ones.
We achieved the impossible and realized the dream we thought was impossible, but thank God, we are living now on solid ground.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, these are moments of celebration, but work is required.
God willing, Alifayn Ittnayn wa Ittishrin, an event worthy of the name Qatar.
I bless each person for the land of Qatar, and I tell him frankly, now Qatar has become a teacher, one of the world's landmarks.
With the hosting of two thousand and twenty-two
Thank you to the elegant and classy media personality, Lana Al-Awadi. We wish you all the best and hope to follow your progress to benefit from sports.
Thank you very much, the joy is definitely in the eyes of the Emir.
Young Qatari talents.
And sitting there, they were singing a new type of song that had emerged during this period.
But in a way that is easy to find on music and rhythm websites, specifically the fast ones.
And a band also, who are in love with rap, God willing.
Be among us, our viewers, and our journey begins from this moment, and good morning.
We are trying to take a look at it.
In short, we can define rap as a fast-paced, lyrical form of music.
The performer of the song oscillates and does not sing a rapid, rhythmic, word-for-word song.
The composition comprising a large number of rhymes addresses a number of subjects and diverse issues.
And which may sometimes be a character.
A meeting of these will be emotional and political.
And they are often controversial.
And quite liberal.
And the rap artist, our viewers, does not sing the lyrics of the song.
He repeats it.
And beautifying his voice is a secondary factor.
Generally, it's not important in rap songs.
And for this reason, he is not called a singer, but rather a rap or r&b performer.
And rappers are concerned with the following forms of racism in songs.
For example, flow, flow of soundwaves, synchronization, for example, or casting.
O Allah, do not make us a burden, a source of concern for their audience, or a mere object of affection for their loves.
They have a certain style, special to rap.
And I expect them to give you a more comprehensive and broader idea than what I personally can provide.
Good morning, oh welcome.
By God, first of all, I mean, it was a period when we loved to do something new.
We are distinguished by something.
So for us, why do we mean we can't rap?
Then, rap means an art that exists in all countries of the world.
Why isn't it in my hand?
So we said, I mean, we are going to invent something new.
Okay, here is the translation of the Arabic text, as requested: It means we give him an idea, including a message.
In it, I spoke about the negatives and positives that occur in our society.
It means to send a message first, second, that it's like a shroud, meaning it.
This is an art among different arts, and by the way, perhaps it means this information is for the viewer. I addressed many social and psychological problems among young people, to a greater extent.
Every time, I expect it to change, and this with the changing of time, I expect.
By God, it was almost as if the weather was very slightly changing, perhaps even becoming a little more humid.
We sing from two thousand and five, approximately. The vocal cord weakness was initially poor.
We will tell about ourselves that it is the new beginning for us, two thousand and ten.
In Taagbel and Shabia, there are more.
She likes, for example, to try to sing and perform in the same style as rap during this period. I noticed this thing.
Yeah, it's definitely a high percentage, considering how many people...
Also, there's something we need to talk about. You've established this, and now several different teams exist.
A beautiful band, did this happen to you? You've had so many concerts, we could talk about this band.
How was it founded and how did the idea come about that indeed one can make a difference and how many are there in this group
I swear, initially, we meant before the band was established.
Rap has reached Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
It means that everyone means loving their rap idea, that he sings rap, that he sings and uploads on the website.
I bring down Salman, he brings down someone, they bring down someone, so there became a competition.
and we got to know people
So, it means we started competing with each other.
Then, after a period, I mean, after all these years, we reached the year 2010.
Instead, two thousand and ten, there was a group system, meaning this is a group on its own, meaning every three or four, together with others.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: We are done, we said why, why don't we unify that we are all one group called Rappers Track.
Or, in simpler terms, rappers.
So we agreed on this, that's it, I mean, we said in one name, we are all one hand, with each other.
And we went up, meaning we pretended, meaning this thing, and we say this idea itself.
The western one twenty-five and one.
Five and twenty, wow, mashallah, a big collection.
Okay, does anyone want to play an instrument or... or... or everyone can perform rap songs.
And he is the one who coordinates and he is the one who composes.
It means you can say something personal.
Here is the translation of the text into English: "How are these numbers organized within the band? Excellent, how are the five and twenty (25) organized?"
He means everyone is on their own, they have their own potential.
It means that every person in the band can create a complete song.
Without needing to call upon any other person.
But there might be differences in skills, for example, if Salman is better than me.
He hears it and says no, the words here are different from something else.
Is it possible for everyone to modify for the other?
You help a little.
حتى actually be there is an official entity that adopts these actions, or even a company for example is taking over.
And there should be correct distributors.
It means until the work appears, like BB بستايل يعني راقي and actually have something official for you.
And by God, we wish for honesty, meaning we wish for support, for it to reach us, for them to say "us", a company that builds, telling us "Come on, we're going down, we're producing for you an album."
We don't have any problem, actually.
Some things are difficult.
Therefore, why don't you think of it as the first initiative that is from you?
Until one can only recognize the first CD.
So, you can attract partners later.
Approximately in the year 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed it, by God, among the youth.
How was the turnout?
By God's
Text text because two thousand and seven, maybe a little art in rap. M-ma-maybe possible, w-working strongly in the Gulf.
But not strongly right now.
We were sitting, talking, on a live stream, meaning for example you are listening to a group of people, a large group, between Valencia and Jaén, for example.
Let's talk about it.
They told us that we are arranging a party for them.
And it means covering all costs and all procedures, and coordination means and work means, frankly means, to be honest, we didn't expect it to be at this level.
It means we exploded honestly and it was a wonderful job.
And there was just a little bit of pressure, meaning there were no ads, there was nothing, meaning the concert was just...
There were no ads, there was nothing. So, two days before the concert.
We said, I mean, no one wants to, I mean, a party in two days before the announcement, no one wants to.
So, while we are inside, meaning before the concert starts.
This means this is a point in our favor.
Yes, we mean that our voice reaches families, not just young people.
We look at it as meaning, our expectation is that the idea, this is just something that young people have.
It means we discovered at this stage that there is, meaning a category, meaning more than a category that listens to us.
In a certain song, there was a greater interaction with the audience and the band.
And most songs would have had interaction.
Most songs were not actually Western, but rather most songs were actually more, and we were a large number.
I mean the group, approximately the entire group.
What are the words, how do they treat different issues?
We are talking about the situation we are in, but what we are in is coming very quickly.
Grill at least, even if it's a lot.
Even if they have spoken before, I am not them.
It turned out you had to output the the the the the random sentences.
That means, I mean, the rhyme comes out.
I mean, we can think about it. I write this, "No," I write this word here, it's better.
Okay, here is the translation: **"Okay, here is the translation:"**
From one of the songs you made.
And we follow it, and we see what the public opinion is regarding this topic.
And God willing, they will also enjoy such words.
Thank you for loving the introduction, as it contains the name of my program.
Accompanying you are DJ Mr. Bobo on the Sabah Al Douha morning program.
Good morning, good morning ladies and gentlemen.
This is how Mr. Bobo and this key together, one hot to break.
And don't forget the program is shown nine thirty in the morning, meaning every one is sitting in front of the television.
Ma'ana f al-i'daad Hassan Na'amah Ma'ana f al-taqdeem Shima Al-Hamadi
With us in the directing is Nasser Al-Malki, the guests of the episode, the rappers of Qatar, for sure.
Because it actually contains the name of the Al-Aalb. Thank you guys, may God give you health. I...
I applaud your efforts, the youth's right is paramount above a room's control.
It was recorded last night.
And I mean, who wrote the lyrics for you, or who
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I had come, I would have written the true words of Yusuf.
Not only does he write the words, these words are about love of singing, love of emotion.
I expect you all need to write for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the Asia Cup. I expect you might be able to get involved, right or wrong?
We definitely, I mean definitely, release a song, so regarding this topic.
That's it, I mean, it feels a bit formal or official, or something like that.
I expect there must be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of what is, the art of rap is indeed true.
Yes, I expect that we are today all waiting for
We are seeing live, on air, right now.
And this cup arrived, beautifying the streets of Doha.
If our viewers, as we saw, Doha is getting ready to receive the Asia Cup.
And the relevant authorities ended all arrangements to be in reception.
The cup was not expected; it is definitely true that there was a larger crowd than what we saw.
A little while ago, I estimate the length of the corniche from the beginning to the end.
Definitely, they are at the reception of this important sporting event.
At upcoming concerts, God willing, I will follow them in the coming days, God willing.
It means that a certain party approached us and said they would arrange a party for us.
So far, things, I mean, it's a bit, there's complexity to it.
The procedures and this is not yet certain.
So, I try to mean, for example, I saw Joseph and I saw someone else.
and i saw a few people that i have, wanting them. i have an issue, a song. and i saw the three
Appropriate for the song.
And the possibility that we can enrich.
I am sitting at home.
And then, he informed Yusuf by email over the internet.
This is Youssef's part of the song.
There is also a way to travel abroad.
Entering this field and having millions of fans means...
We are not trying to imitate, but one listens, meaning what is better.
But if it means a strong competitor with its style,
So what prevents me from taking ideas from them and imitating them in things?
Just mean to reverse it, mean take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song, I in a different form.
They formed a special band and they have more than one CD. There are people...
Look for someone named Abdullah Al-Dayl.
He has experience and the ability to discover groundwater.
And it is represented in their ability to detect the locations of underground water sources.
One of the residents of the city of Marat.
There are many experienced people.
To locate water sources before drilling wells.
And he might need A or he might dig many wells and there is no water.
Using copper rods or pomegranate branches.
Or, the figs from which water wells are inferred.
What tools does he use?
The discovered groundwater.
This is an old one.
As for now, it has been replaced with copper skewers.
Now, we place the two pencils with each other in a parallel way.
And now we walk with steps that are not hurried, a light walk.
We watch when we pass by a watercourse.
When the rods open.
Now, now, we are going through, now, this form, now, we are going through the watercourse.
It opened now in this way.
When we exceed, it begins now.
This is now the middle of the watercourse.
And from here, it will be the middle.
We can determine the watercourse or underground watercourse by this method.
And of course, the process is repeated more than once in more than one location until the strongest site is found.
Abu Ibrahim confirms.
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession...
To become his discoveries, his scrutiny, and his precision.
In the area, sometimes and outside sometimes, in Shaqra, in Ahirmaleh, in Athathia.
And more than 150 wells were discovered.
The error rate was five percent, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God Almighty.
We are superior to modern devices and laboratories.
And in a very short record time.
Abdelrahman Al-Murshed
Good morning Doha
Madyat Mirdat, northwest of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
We followed up on this report, and we promise you, God willing, with other reports from Arab and global countries.
And a Gulf woman, God willing.
We have reached with you now, our viewers, to publications and addresses different but having their meaning.
The large and the first title and...
If I expect there is a large group of young Gulfis.
Some people, in particular, you look up to.
However, it means, for example, don't just imitate them, but feel that it's necessary to follow their work first بأول.
By God, they are the rappers of the Gulf region in general, and there is a connection between them.
It means not a competitor, competitions are formed, it means
And i will talk about the topic
It means a competitor will be formed, as you say, with a specific aim.
In this way, there can be a connection between us, and it means that there is only one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai is like this, mashallah, he's making a scene.
To a large extent, he got a CD, and he gained an audience.
And he has more than one company that could adopt him.
You wish you could reach this stage, and perhaps even go beyond this stage, even more so. God willing.
God willing, we wish you all the best, God willing, through these teams.
Here it is: **Present as always, receiving this important sports cup, the Asia Cup. Let's see the shots that are present on the Corniche.**
And in addition to a group of Qatari youth.
She moves, whether from the West but with a Gulf style.
And also, emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished group of twenty-five people.
It is necessary for one to follow your news first بأول.
I expect you must have an email, perhaps a specific website on the internet or a forum.
How can one reach you? How can one reach you?
By God, he, a while ago, we had a private website of our own.
But if there were any problems with the company, the hosting company.
He would sometimes get drunk, sometimes I'm not sure what.
So, it means we faced problems with it, and finally, that's it, we closed this.
Okay, here is the translation of the
Okay, and now what is the alternative currently, even if this problem is solved as a team?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even Morocco or Egypt.
One must communicate with you and learn your news and see the songs that you produce from time to time.
What is the alternative now?
The alternative currently relies on private pages, for example.
Exactly what is the name of it?
He said no, Jowfi from Atsween Sirj but in Google.
In the name of Rap Qatar or Qatari rappers.
Make video clips, even for yourselves.
For the program, you worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
song and i take pictures
Song, same format, video but I shoot one after the other.
I expect that I must see you progressing further.
You need a place that comforts you, and everyone should have their device at home.
And the saw, the computer, the piano, the guitar.
By God, the truth is, I mean, I hope that any support will come to us.
It means, for example, a company.
We produce CDs for you.
Let's make you a special place.
From ourselves
But in the end, we remain, meaning it's a personal, individual matter.
We don't want it to be a personal matter.
By God, my words are no different from Yusuf's words.
A music video, we will definitely need a music video.
And the album
And his propagation video clip, I expect it's very important.
Because it conveys more information.
If support is present, everything is with them.
Your sweet voices reach every place.
It means it is considered one of the various arts that addresses problems and treats issues.
Thank you to Yousef Al-Naimi and Salman Al-Abdullah for being with us.
Let's see it, and of course, we wish them success, it's our hope for the future.
These projects were indeed.
Here is the translation of the provided text: **"In a project, it is also ready, almost, but it needs some technical development for it."**
Expiration Date Price
You reach the cashier. You have the total, you have all the details, and you are ready.
And to identify the goods instead of holding each specific detail and examining the components and their effects.
While he was walking on the tram.
The translation is: **"Whether the compound itself, then one can choose the material they want with more precision."**
Of course, the projects, most of them, actually reflect the child's feelings about a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center, right now, in its software design and events, is built upon a main idea.
We have ten goals that Her Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Thani established in founding the center.
Possible, possible, also.
He goes down directly to the bottom. He moves under the ground. He goes down to the train that is under the ground, from his house.
But its main idea is that it's clothing.
Will all the stores in Qatar that have the black T-shirt show up for me?
Is there also a house key, a car key? I have a button to press.
Here's the translation of the provided text: **"Does it show me if I've lost it? Is it gone from me? Will it take me to the key's right?"**
Yes, we will return again to the projects that you will undertake, God willing, through the Cultural Center.
and is the early education for children
And develop his skills and build talented individuals.
So, what we are talking about is, essentially, a set of children's skills, whether it's related to media or research.
If the personal skills in speaking to an audience, in convincing an audience...
By the diversification of all these skills, we set up a special program for them that serves them.
We started from the signs of the future and accomplished a great achievement in it. Now we have reached graduation projects and their end.
We also reached a large number of child preachers, young children.
and their creativity
You have a few younger hosts as well.
Returning to television means it's necessary for them to provide children's programs.
We are sitting, counting them for the television.
Across their television, Qatar TV.
Their number for this now means we finish with them to eighteen years.
Welcome to them wherever they may be, yes.
This is also the national television.
And our need to attract, acquire, gain, discover, and develop these talents.
From journalist to researcher.
To a private corner for V thinking.
To the readers, to various and many fields.
There are several collaborations between you, where you exchange ideas.
In every field, for example, the "Promise of a Preacher" program with the Ministry of Endowments.
This is our exhibition, the Generations Exhibition. This, too.
The scientific club and its role were great in developing projects and also in providing technical support for these projects.
The biggest role also lies with the Supreme Council for Education, supporting schools, and fostering partnerships.
Mr. Abdullah, your move to Katara, this great monument...
Those who gather also have a large collection of events and wonderful amenities.
Does the following count as a significant push forward, specifically for the center itself?
Although you take a building like that which is separate.
Far from this great monument.
And He gave us an interface to deal with the public in an easier way, meaning
And pioneering projects as well, good ones.
And in many of the reception of guests and their introduction to the nature of the programs that present cultural programs for children.
Because we, our main project during these past three years.
It is the national project for developing reading among children.
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided support for it, meaning it is very significant.
This is a major project which focuses on developing children's reading and writing skills, specifically through the creation and development of children's stories and the enhancement of associated skills.
The different cultural aspects that specifically relate to reading.
Of course, there are many programs.
I mean now we have recently moved.
And Badi now means reorganizing the after meaning activities.
and its design and development are appropriate to the nature of the visitors, meaning Katara.
We definitely wish you all the best, God willing, through this center.
That which gathers within its folds very important ideas.
Of course, the first thing is to thank you for this generous hospitality.
The most important thing is honestly that the more we interact with children, the more we discover about our children.
I mean, today's children are different from yesterday's children. Their childhood is different from our childhood.
They need us to pay more attention and focus and give them more time.
Give him enough listening to pay attention and to his imagination.
And I communicated with him intellectually.
They work, meaning their approach to dealing with children is more like a hotel where they provide the accommodation.
It is either a bank that provides him with money, or it is a bank that he provides money for.
Or, it's missing. The child lacks someone to listen to these thoughts, to listen to this imagination.
And we really lived, they transferred us, now during the past days at the exhibition, they transferred us to twenty-thirty.
Through this exhibition
We wish you success, God willing, for the projects that have won awards.
Thank you for your attendance, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Children. We wish you all the best, God willing.
Until these projects actually come to fruition and exist in reality, rather than remaining a perpetual dream.
Welcome to our viewers. The Cultural Center for Children concluded its activities on the past Monday at the Diplomatic Club.
National Exhibition of the Dreams of Generations Under the شعار "Dreams of Generations, Truths of a Nation, Tomorrow's Reality",
Which he organized on the occasion of the National Day of the Country, with the participation of more than seventy children from the children of Qatar.
The exhibition witnessed our viewers various activities and different competitions.
Innovative projects for children.
Generally, we are pleased on your behalf, our viewers, to host Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, welcome, my dear sister in faith.
Thank you for making time for the center.

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This exhibition, of course, this exhibition.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood
For today's National Day celebrations.
And he had a very important, of course, touch with every child.
with the aim of empowering children
Who is he living with a dream?
And with the project
This project or dream.
The dreams of children are vast.
Its fields are wide, we have defined them within a framework which is a twenty-thirty diameter.
And other key areas for Qatar Vision 2030.
We started by training the children in four stages.
And how do brainstorming and the toolkit set facilitate the expansion of a child's cognitive domain?
What do you mean by this sentence specifically?
Here are the facts of tomorrow's homeland.
Meaning that what our children are dreaming about today.
This project is growing alongside this project.
This was a reality, meaning it was an interpretation of this vision. That from this day the children will begin to live.
I have a big dream.
Whether it's an environmental field, for example, in the field of health and human development, or in other fields.
That serves the country.
I expect that when we know that children are present in a specific location, we will take action.
Or at a specific exhibition.
Was all of this present through
The exhibition featured special guest of honor.
The honorary guests are the, until the children learn from them as role models.
The Arab fall began two weeks or three ago.
And among the winners were those who received various prizes in the Arab world.
There was a schedule to display their projects.
Yes, and the pictures, definitely, meaning they are a witness to your statement, Mr. Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were available on the [platform name - likely a social media or exhibition platform] of course, the exhibition and various events.
This is also a friend of the owner of the recent project, the owner of the forest.
Innovative or creative.
This is one of the children's innovations, mashallah. It means a very beautiful idea. It is possible for us to simplify it for the viewer.
And we tell it a bit. What is this topic exactly? The colored football.
So, approximately four or five projects discussed this topic, including Colored Balls.
or what we call it, the smart stadium as well.
This is the ball if it goes outside the pitch.
Its color changes, varying.
We expect this in matches more significantly in the future, God willing.
Okay, what comes after these dreams, I mean?
It also concerns a need, meaning it relates to his interests.
And I expect that, especially when there are officials who take into consideration these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects really serve us. Okay, the chairman of the football union here in Qatar.
What is Ma Raya's opinion on his thought, the colored hatred?
Did you love the idea?
And the price of a visit, of course, and he stood on the projects that dedicated the football.
A serious stop and adoption of these projects at once.
Large for the exhibition at its moment and these projects are adopted.
The public also voted for a large group of projects presented by our children.
And our loved ones, well, what projects could we realistically say were, you know, highlighted more significantly and with more voice?
Certainly, we have in our system the following assessment methods: * **Method of Evaluation:** This refers
These projects are the ones that won awards. The first, second, and third projects.
He was from the forest and won the First Prize.
He has very detailed specifications for the project, and the project was ready to begin.
I mean, besides administrative, of course, it needs many administrative aspects.
She got into a lot of very detailed, distributed, brochures for visitors, etc., almost as if it were ready for her project.
This is definitely the pictures that we are currently sitting and looking at.
This is a group, yes, this is a group as well, many projects have been participated in.
Maybe they feel that way, they mean, it's not that they are uninterested, they are just... watching movies or shows.
No, she has indeed been linked. It might be partially realized, or institutions might have adopted parts of it.
For example, we assign project names, what are these projects?
This appendix, how can it be utilized at home? How can it be managed, collected, and then reused?
Two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University yesterday celebrated the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third semester.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation.
and a large number of parents and teaching staff
The university today celebrates the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We of course thank colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. A dear guest will be with us today.
From a family of artists, the series "Tassnif" showcases the work of artist Abdulhamid al-Shirshini.
And he confirmed his attendance, undertaking many works, including the series "Hearts for Rent."
And they tired themselves in proving themselves on the artistic scene.
It is especially true in the art world, as it does not tolerate compliments.
This means
Welcome to you, good morning, and I would like to greet the viewers.
On the contrary, the program is secured and well-coded, honestly.
I will see something very simple from one of your works and start a dialogue with you.
You are mocking me.
Took the counterfeit abaya and bring the original one.
Go and bring it.
The bisht is available.
What is this suit? Return it, how do I return it?
That's it, curse the thing she ground in her stomach, curse her father.
I am a member of a committee composed of five members.
In the Supreme Committee of the Conference
I do not agree with you.
I don't have a problem.
Here's the translation of your text into English: "If this is a quick clip, it's a short paragraph from a series called Tasaneef, which I will watch. Part two."
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part.
Will you tell us a little about your roles, which is a series, the classifications of each episode being a different topic?
What is your participation telling us about it?
Of course, after.
The times of that era have passed.
And the Marat region is also famous for its mountain.
Akmat, which poets have long sung about through the ages.
When the date is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
And indicates the antiquity of its past.
Which is one hundred seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
It was said that his lineage goes back to Imru' al-Qays al-Tamimi.
It was characterized by its monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
Famously sung by poets, captivated by its allure, and its widespread recognition inextricably linked to its renowned mountain, known affectionately as "the little ruby mountain" (Kazan el Qamar el Ruban), a testament to its enduring charm and historical significance.
It is said that a ghadir is a kumayt.
Certainly, the city of Marat is a city with a long history.
And it preceded the emergence of Islam.
There were old things whose history was unknown, such as the Khalid well and the story of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
which now we are not existing in it
The Sahabi al-jal, Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, when passing by the Ridda War, ordered the digging of this well.
And I remained until our day.
The proverb says: "Guarantee me your food, and I will guarantee you sustenance for many times."
"If you see a comet, you will see it often."
Certainly, among the other effects, there is also Ghadeer Kameet.
Which well is a source of pure, fresh water for many years.
Which was enough for the city for an entire year.
From the beginning of rainfall until the next rainy season.
This artifact is also in a running state, and its date of creation is unknown.
There is also the bride and there is
Jabal Kumeit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marat.
And this mountain was said to have many proverbs, poems, and songs.
Whereas it comes to him from all the regions of the kingdom.
Among its most prominent effects is the Bir Al-Walidi well.
And that was because he camped during the days of the wars of apostasy, while his direction of travel was towards al-Yamamah.
He encamped there and ordered men to dig this well.
The one whose water is still sought for ritual purification until now, and for ablution.
Yakut al-Hamawi mentioned in his Dictionary of Countries that Khalid passed by Marat.
It is a very old mud house that was restored to its original condition.
It contains many sections that highlight the architectural character of the region and its famous heritage and monuments.
About whom the poet said, "And when we reached the water, the water of Mihyan,"
Ghadir is a dark red, not a current one. Ghadir is a dark red, not a current one.
Also, Professor Ayman, there is Mashallah, meaning cooperation between between the family and the guardian and the guardian with this center with the child also.
And I expect there are different ways it could be with you firsthand.
Management of the general training process.
From his moment, the intern does not come to us or the student or the child, and so on.
This this file will contain complete personal data.
Even his 100% grades, every month, he has a monthly ovulation anomaly, meaning we are probably... **(End of translation)**
It is a housing, a program, an economy.
Every four lectures, there will be a distortion.
through a username and password, a user can, for a guardian:
We give it to him, and he is able to access it.
Yes, he can see, meaning how far his level has progressed from when he first joined until this very day.
Yes, we have several different models, which we will follow up on.
We have a small child.
With Mr. Ibrahim, surely he will honor us after a while.
We are going to see several different models. We wish we had enough space.
But we brought a model of a child.
He will be tested, meaning more than one test is in front of you, live on air.
We ask her questions in mathematics and different questions.
We will take a short break and will continue with you. After that, we will see this intelligent child. Be with us.
The artist's audience has become smart now.
It means any work that attracts him from the beginning, two or three times, he sees the work and is attracted to it, but just turns the remote.
He won't bother himself, he has twenty thousand series, others.
Correct, twenty thousand series, this is correct.
"سلسلة السنة" means "and some people no, one should focus on one work."
Putting aside other tasks, one can see them.
true, it is not false
He says to you, "I don't watch TV except for Ramadan."
Of course, we welcome your presence with us as a generous and dear guest, Abdul Aziz Al-Shirshani.
I love to direct any word to the viewers, to the audience, to you of course, who loves you. I am part of your audience, for sure.
Address us a word.
I tell them every year and you are well.
True, we don't come out much, we don't come out a lot, we don't act a lot, of course I mentioned the reasons, I...
The coming is better.
God willing, we wish you success in your work this year.
God willing, it will be in us a second meeting to talk about these plays.
It's all connected.
Fashion shows are beginning to attract many people, and fashion lovers are waiting for them, especially for new models.
We welcome you, our dear viewers, across Sabah al-Duha, and we are with you over the airwaves.
Today, surely we are sitting and talking about the Centre for Skill Development and a group of female and male students, and our children who have joined this centre.
This center offers a wide range of different sciences.
Certainly, their focus is on developing different abilities.
And also to activate their minds a hundred percent, God willing.
Professor, of course, a breeze. And Professor Ayman Khawal, who is the executive director of the Center for Skill Development.
Hello and good morning.
May God greet you.
And we have a beautiful girl, Omnia, wishing you a good morning.
Good morning
How old are you, my love?
Predator ships
What God has willed, we wish you all the best.
What matters are the things you offer to our sons and daughters.
A clarification was provided with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nasma, specifically for a program that would benefit children, our children.
And it is a program for mathematical intelligence.
By way of facricorns and by way of the abax.
To achieve some specific goals together, we have tried to clarify a part of it that is simple.
I felt, teacher I felt, teacher Ibrahim, that there was, there was a difference. Indeed, when the student first enters, in those first two days.
And after he completes with you for months, perhaps three or four months.
If he were teaching in public, private, or even independent schools.
Initially, the program is not scientifically conducted through specific methods.
After the first level of the program has passed.
The one that explains where the abilities that the child had lost or wer
And it has reached a certain limit, or what developments have occurred with the child.
So, we are proceeding with a scientific approach, a scientific program.
It is not merely that some methods or mechanisms are applied in an ordinary manner.
No, in a scientific manner, in an organized way.
Before the program begins and after taking this course or the levels he went through.
Assistant Ibrahim is now present with us, as you can see, our viewers, a student who has joined this center.
We loved this thing to happen today on air so we can show you, our viewers, the importance of this.
The bisht will be returned, I have no objection.
If this is a quick clip, it's a short paragraph from a series called Tasaneef. I will watch the second part of it.
But since we saw this segment from the series "Tasaneef Part 1",
Will you tell us a little about your roles, which is a series, the classifications of each episode being a different topic.
This appears to be a mix
Careless, then constant.
She urged while sitting, giving opportunities.
Twenty-four volumes in the Tawf.
Here is the translation of the provided text: Certainly, there is an episode director, there is an elderly person, there is a baker.
It means various languages.
Mr. Ghanim Al-Sulaiti from Qatar.

We have
Faisal Rasheed and Mohamed Adel
Okay, here
If it were not for Tara, the young men would not have acted.
He said the business, we, it happened in Qatar, so, in a year, you have two works.
Qatar TV also produces drama series, and we can be held accountable.
Ghatr TV is giving a product.
Qatar TV did well, of course, but one work per year, and all Qatar's actors want to work.
This was the reason.
Det Aliyj an musalsal wahid wa kull fannanin Qatar yuboon yashtagholun fih.
The one, even if he experiences a scene, says 'Thank God'.
Praise be to God in every circumstance.
Okay, let's mean we go back to your beginnings.
I would certainly extend my great thanks to him.
Consult him on various things.
The artist Abdul Aziz Jassem, from the rule of humans to a final day beyond dispersal, to yes and no.
In his plays, we started working with him, a theater day. He produced his first implementing product, Abdulaziz Jasim. We worked with him, us as a theater and as television.
He is the one who adopted us, the one who taught us, and the one who shaped us.
Ghanem, in the stories of this world, did not fall short with us in Faez Al Tawash Al Feen.
Because frankly, it gave us opportunities, we as young people.
They have thirty to thirty-two businesses per year.
So we have two works per year, so thank you thank you Tara.
Gat's feeling, of course, the same thing, produced by Tara for artistic production.
The show's director, Mr. Mounir Al-Z.
We returned to you, our viewers, and today's topic is about reflexology.
Massage via hand, palm.
This is the therapy that has actually been practiced since ancient times.
And we brought a guest with us.
The examination method is as follows
Swelling, throbbing, pain.
You feel inside the hand, sometimes you feel like there is sand, like veins that are crumbling inside the hand.
Relax your hand.
Of course, we have the brother, who is a bit intense.
You feel a sense of overwhelming stress.
The left side

Ten years ago, I walked barefoot on the beach.
Okay, we know that when a person walks along the sea, it is expected to empty. طيب احنا نعرف ان الواحد لما يمشي عالبحر اتوقع ان يفرغ كذ
Any uneven ground, not just the sea.
Negative energies, possibly in panels.
He, perhaps also, was surprised by you, that you discovered these matters through massage.
Surely the most important people are the children.
The children, glory be to Allah, to the mother, focus with me.

It means walking on sand is fine, but not on rocks.
Break your fast with seven fresh dates, they are the best.
And if you don't put moist dates, a sufficient amount, God willing.
As He said in the Holy Quran, "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan, and my discovery this from the Quran, of course."
I mean, God became incapable of making this humid date arrive for her, when He was not incapable.
Your praise belongs to God, and to God I ask refuge from the word 'I'.

She collaborates with some, meaning each one, for me, is a piece of advice for every creature who listens to me now.
Be careful to give charity and be careful to care for others. You were created to worship God, then...
To serve the people, this is the first thing. The second thing is, we, I, am not a religious leader, nor a sheikh. I am a normal human being.
Salam, Mr. Abdul Aziz. I thank you for this kind meeting. Of course, thanks to our distinguished guest who is with us.
May God give you a thousand blessings. God willing, and with success, O Lord.
He will update us in more detail, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health Administration at the Supreme Council of Health.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's directly start with an overview of these events.
The truth is a program of healthy steps towards Qatar.
It means it is a program that, if it were part of the national strategy to address combating obesity,
It means four out of the ten countries in the world with the highest obesity are from the Gulf countries.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "We started at the Supreme Council of Health with a strategy, of course, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other entities in fighting obesity."
Fearful of its further spread, **Villan** will be **present** soon.
The steps towards Qatar for healthy protection from obesity.
They are conducting this competition with the participation of F, making it an international competition.
The program is essentially six weeks.
Each week is different from the next week.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health during this age.
Because it's the first time they start, meaning they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about what is your favorite fruit.
The second week of walking.
You have to go, meaning of course, every time someone goes, they get points.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English, as requested: "She is a map of Qatar and the more one collects points, the more one applies [a rule/process] and steps forward in one's school, taking steps forward, and a class taking steps forward means."
It will have a nice competition, meaning between the students.
In the third week, he drinks Manibe water, he shouldn't drink soft drinks.
Let's say it gets used to drinking water, even when it's unnecessary. There are many carbonated drinks available. Whenever you feel thirsty, you can take a carbonated water. However, it is better not to drink plain water.
Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport.
Some of it has games for school that he doesn't like.
We are looking for a sports game that he would enjoy.
To force him, meaning to mean, to practice sports.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that they must pay attention to their son, that they should give him a healthy meal.
And the Al Jazeera Academy, the boys and girls academy, so that we can take
This is definitely an example of its success, God willing. We will definitely increase the experiment in the coming years.
Of course, the students are enjoying themselves. I don't know what their feeling, but it says our activity is more.
We asked for more games, and we enjoyed our colleagues more.
Girls tell you my skin has improved, acne has lessened.
Correct, exactly right, it becomes conscious.
Fathers know about their children.
And his colleagues who are in the second rows, they say "What's your news?" meaning "And what are you learning from them?" And his colleagues, and the brothers.
And praise be to God, it has started to spread that there are many schools eager to participate next year, from now on of course, meaning...
God willing.
Of course, the official sponsor was Qtel in their support of this.
We had a Spare Zone. They presented sports competitions for students and awareness.
All on all on all on the dining table means.
So, praise be to God, there are several points, meaning, I mean, I mean, I mentioned these, and there are some that perhaps I missed.
But thank God, everyone participated with a part of what they had.
Some brothers used to hold competitions on Saturday.
It had variety in it.
We tried to make several types and include the largest number of people.
He is the generation of the future, meaning...
To generalize this experiment or spread it as much as possible, for example in Qatar.
So you will be setting up for the first time, where there will be some, meaning things, that you will need to adjust.
After its widespread dissemination, thank God, it is now and the satisfactory results.
God willing, we are publishing it because there are people now who are demanding, asking, 'Why didn't you include us?'
You eat healthy food, you will reach this point, it's not that you don't have a problem.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"We are at this age when, starting from his young age, he will reach what he wants when he is twenty years old or twenty-five years old."**
You mentioned a collection of titles. Each week there was a title.
If we go back, we will try. In our paragraph today, it will be about concluding the events.
And also, if we come back to reminding people, we are in our program where we had more than hosting.
Let's go back and revisit this every week. What were these pieces of information that we wanted to convey to the students?
God willing, my sister. First thing, of course, for example, during the first week, what is your favorite fruit?
Of course, the fruits in general, a portion of the fruit, what are its benefits?
What is the use of fruits that contain Vitamin C?
So, it's with itself that it begins to know what it likes in fruit, not all fruit. Its enemies are meaning.
So, it's possible he could develop an allergy to one or two types, but why not the rest?
The second week, people walk, and they think it's just for little kids to be lazy and not walk.
When I grow up, I will walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it calms the mind and the brain, meaning it.
And it comforts the human soul, meaning in walking, clarity of mind improves, meaning.
You were taking them to walk for students.
None of them are required to walk, whether in school or at home.
And they record their points through grade schools.
Because they are how much, not daily, I mean.
This event had people who marched in a school girls march
We want them to be creative, meaning they have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers coming up with new ideas, we don't want to give them ideas, they don't go out about them.
Each person had, I mean, their skills in this point.
Of course, the third week, I drink water, of course. We try to drink them water so they don't get thirsty and crave taking carbonated water.
Of course, the fourth week is when your favorite sport is played.
So we will if we are able to reach his favorite sport and support him in it.
He is passionate about sports.
Their love for sports is that he is playing it, he is playing a sport without realizing it.
Since we talked before about it, we will talk about the Qatari Association for Patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases.
Let me welcome the guest of our episode today, who has enlightened our studio.
Welcome to you.
May God greet you with us in this program.
And among them, this disease, perhaps to many of us, has not been heard of.
First, as the Egyptians say, straight to the point, we will get straight to the topic.
Here is a chronic disease.
It affects the nervous system in the human body.
It affects the interval from twenty to forty years.
This disease also has no cure yet and no known cause yet. For this disease and its infection.
It typically affects the active demographic in society, which is the youth demographic.
Cancer treatments, uses for patients, remove evil and other diseases from you.
This disease is a form of inflammation in the nerves of the brain and the nerves of the spine.
And it is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body rejects the presence of a foreign body.
The nerve cell is composed of...
The one that covers this electrical wire.
White blood cells, the first of the leukocytes, kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Leading to the absence or weakening or impairment of the neural signal.
Leads to severe paralysis, God forbid it happens to you.
Until now, with the development of medicine and the progress of medicine, meaning professor Abdulaziz, until now we have not found a solution to this disease.
Okay, let's change the solution. We want to understand how it comes to us, meaning
Also, one must have preventive measures for this topic.
It means the direct cause, like the nature of life, the nature of food, cellular processes in life.
And what is exactly the direct reason that makes a person possibly get infected with this disease?
Everything that currently exists is merely theories.
Even by the condition of marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans face.
Yes, Yes
