Jesus went to the other side of the land of the ten tribes of Judah. The people who lived there, the inhabitants, were not outsiders; they were people who had chosen to live in that land. They were not a hostile people. There was no reason for them to be aggressive towards those who had crossed the waterway to reach their land. The statement describes a situation where outsiders (those who crossed the water) arrive in an area already inhabited by people with strong ties to the land (the ten tribes, the chosen people). The potential for conflict arises from this juxtaposition of different groups with varying claims and connections to the same piece of land.

Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
Jesus got into the boat and crossed over, coming to his own city.
And they brought a man, a paralytic, who was lying on his bed, and the light of Jesus illuminated their faith. He said to the paralytic, "Be courageous, my son, for your sins are forgiven."
And a group of Jewish writers said in their hearts: "This man has blasphemed!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He asked, "Why do you study evil in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven," than to say: "Get up and walk around?"
As to let you know that I am a Son of Man, who has authority over the earth, to forgive sins.' And immediately after that he said to the paralytic, 'Get up! Take your bed and go to your house.'
Dude got up and went home.
And when the people saw what had happened, they feared and praised God who had given such power to men. Jesus called out, "When will this be?" * **Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32**

As Jesus heard a certain thing, he said: "It is not those who are healthy that need a physician; rather, it is those who are ill."

There is not even one who can mend an old garment with new fabric, because the fabric is meant to drink and eat away from the old garment, and the cut becomes larger.
And there isn't anyone who would put new wine in an old jar, for the jar would be broken, the wine spilled, and the jar shattered. But new wine is always put into new jars, and thus the two are preserved." The little girl greeted and the woman who had received no clothes for Jesus was healed (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56).
When Jesus was speaking to them, a certain one of the principal pharisees came up and prostrated himself before him, saying, "My daughter, she has not yet died. Come, lay your hand upon her, and she will be restored to life."
Jesus arose and his disciples followed him.
And there was a woman suffering from bleeding for twelve years, who came to him from afar and reached out to the party of his drink,

Jesus, who had just passed by, then two blind men followed him, crying out, "O son of David, have mercy on us!"
When he entered his house, two blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Is it not enough for you to have
And when Jesus looked at them, He had compassion on them and said, "For the sake of your faith, let it done."
And their eyes were fixed. And Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Watch carefully that no one knows!"
They, those very ones, went out and spread the news of it throughout the whole entire region. Jesus heals a man who had an ear affliction.
And when the two blind men went out, a group brought one of them, with a bag, and a demon living in him.
Jesus, the devil, and the boash (a type of garment) all left, and he began to speak. The people, amazed, said, "We have not seen a thing like this in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "He will come forth at the end, with the force of the chief of the last." Jesus showed compassion for the people.
And Jesus went from town to town, and he taught in their synagogues. And he preached the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, and he healed the people of all their sicknesses and their woes.
When he saw the people, he was kind to them because they were worried and tired, just like sheep that have no room to roam.
He said to his disciples, "The fools are few, but the wise are rare."
Send word to the master of the passion that he send servants for his passion.**
The twelve apostle (Mark ‎3‎:‎13‎-19; Luke ‎6‎:‎12‎-16)
And He called the twelve disciples, and He gave them authority over the unclean spirits, that they might come out, and that they might heal people of all manner of diseases and sorrows.
These are the names of the twelve apostles of Jesus: The first was named Simon, who was called by the name Peter; and his brother was named Andrew; and James the son of Zebedee was a brother of John.
And Filips, Berthlamos, Thoma, Matt, who records taxes, Jacob, son of حلفى, TDAUS;
And Simon, who is zealous for his country, and Judas the Iscariot, who is to betray Jesus. And Jesus sends the Unrighteous as an Emissary (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent these twelve and instructed them: "Do not go to any one of the towns of the peoples of the other nations, or do not enter into any one of the cities of the Samaritans,
Let the sheep without a herdsman be counted for the tribes of Israel.
And as you go, make it known and tell them that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, evaluate the dead, heal the sick from leprosy, expel the devils. You have taken without giving, give without expecting.
Do not shake, no gold, no silver, no copper in your belts.
Not a handful, not two garments, not a sandal, not a stick; for the servant deserves his sustenance.
And no city, no village, that you enter, even if you only stay for a little while, you will find within it someone who deserves to be invited into his home, and you will remain with him until your journey is complete.
And when you enter the house, greet the people in it.
And if my hopes for that house are well-placed, let your greetings come to them; but if they are not well-placed, your greetings will return to you.
And if any one does not accept you or does not listen to your words, shake the dust from your legs when you come out, whether from the house of that person or from the city of that person.
Your right to transfer: This is the state of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment, for it shall be better than the state of that city! The persecution that is about to take place. (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
We will send you off like sheep in the middle of wolves, or else you will surely be aware like vipers, and good like doves.
Be careful of the people, for they are troubled and will not hand you over to the Jewish council, nor will they flog you with rods in their synagogues.
And you will shake your fists at the rulers and kings, for my sake, so that you may testify before them, them and the peoples of the others.
When they hand you over, don't think about how you will speak or what you will say, for in this very moment, your speech and your saying will be withheld.
May you be safe, it's not just you who speak, but go away and let those who walk on your path speak.
The brother who hands his brother over to death, and the father who is the son, and the sons who go around their fathers and kill them,
And all the people will hate you because of my name. But whoever proves himself to the other, he will be rewarded.
When they persecute you in one city, flee to another city; remember your right: no one shall compel you to go through all the towns of Israel, before I come; for I am the true Israel, and the home of the true Jerusalem.
The student is not greater than his teacher, nor is the servant greater than his master.
Let the student be enough for him to be like his teacher, and to serve as his master's servant. If the master of the house is called Baalzebul, what must his family call themselves? Fear of the Lord (Luke 12:2-7).
«Fear them not. Nothing is hid that is not to be seen. And nothing is concealed that is not to be known.»
And I will tell it to you in the darkness, tell it in the light. And what is said to you slowly in your ears, call it from the roofs. And what is whispered to you, call it from the highest places.
And do not fear when they kill the body, for they cannot kill the soul. But rather fear when He is able to destroy both the soul and the body, and to cast them both into Hell.
My brother, isn't it strange how two sparrows can be sold for a mere franc? And they only land on the ground if their father, who is in the sky, so much as knows of them.
Even the hair on your heads, everything is calculated.
Do not fear, for you are better than many birds!
Whether it is someone who acknowledges me in public, I acknowledge them in front of my father, who is in the sky.
As for one who opposes me before the people, I also will oppose that person before my Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
"What comes to your mind, I came to bring peace to the land, I didn't come to bring peace but to bring a sword."
I came to distinguish between the son and his father, the daughter and her mother, the sister-in-law and her mother-in-law.
And man's enemies are his hopes so that they may be his hopes.
He who loves his father or his mother more than I do does not deserve me. He who loves his son or his daughter more than I do does not deserve me.
He who does not raise his cross and follow me, does not deserve me.
He who gains his life will lose it, and he who loses his life, may he find it for me.» The الأجر ( مرقس ‏9‏:‏36‏-41 )
He who receives you, receives me; and he who receives me, receives the one who sent me.
He who accepts, a man for his own sake, wills to take a man's reward, a man for his own sake. He who accepts, a woman for her own sake, wills to take a woman's reward, a woman for her own sake.
And he who gives a little money to these small ones, until a glass of cold water for their comfort, my dear student, I tell you the truth, his reward is not lost.»
Students of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished His ministry and had appointed His twelve apostles, He departed from that place to teach and preach in the towns of that region.
John, while in prison, heard about the works of Christ and then Jesus sent Him with His disciples.
And they said, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go, and tell John that you have seen him and heard him,
#إش ‏35‏:‏5‏-6؛ ‏61‏:1؛ لو ‏4‏:‏18‏-19 العميان يشوفوا، والعايبين يمشيو، المرضى بالبرص يتشفاو، والطرش يسمعوا، والموتى يقوموا، والمساكين يتبشروا بالإنجيل.
and why should those who don't doubt be!»
When the students of John went away, Jesus began to tell the people about John and said, "What have you come out for to see in the hollows? A reed on which the wind moves?"
Is it not what you went out for to see? To see a man dressed in expensive clothes? Those are the ones dressed in expensive clothes in the kings' palaces!
What exactly did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, and I will tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Mal #:3;1; *Mor #:2;1: *This is what you write on in the Holy Book: "I send ahead of you my representative, whom he shall send ahead to make your way easy."
Your right has not appeared, for no one among those the women brought forth was greater than John the Baptist; but he was the least of all in the kingdom of heaven, greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until today, and the kingdom of heaven is established, advancing with power, and the strong people are drawing upon it.
All the prophets, and the Law, prophesied until John came.
And if you would like to believe, it is John the Baptist who is to come.
Let whoever has two ears, let them hear!
What does this generation resemble? They are like children sitting in a market, calling out to each other:
We congratulated you and you did not boast, and we mourned you and you did not cry.
John came; he did neither eat nor drink. They said unto him, "He is possessed by a demon."
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "I, Jesus, the Son of God, tell you this: I am a common man, an ordinary man, who eats food and drinks drink. You say, 'Here is a wonderful man, a great scholar, a knowledgeable person, who is friends with those who are considered rebels, evildoers, and sinners.' But the truth is this: The one who has the wisdom, the understanding, and the knowledge of God, is truly wise and knowledgeable. This is the case with the cities that have rejected the word of God, as described in Luke 10:13-15."
And from that time forth, Jesus began to denounce the cities where His great miracles and hopes had been wrought, but where the inhabitants did not repent.
And he said: "Oh woe to you, Corazze! Oh woe to you, Beth Said! If the great miracles that you perform among you, were to be done in Tyre and Sidon, then surely Tyre and Sidon would be the hopes of their people, for they would have repented, put on their packsaddles, and seated themselves on the ashes.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"As for us, we will tell you: The condition of the city of Sur and of Saida, so that it will be better than your condition on the Day of Judgment."**
And you, O Capernaum! Oh, will you ascend to heaven? You will descend to the depths. For if the great miracles that were wrought in you were wrought in the city of Sodom, then it would have remained until this day.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"As for me, I tell you: What-soever the state of the ground of Sodom, that it be better than your state on the day of judgment." Jesus rejoices (Luke ‎10‏:‏21‏-22‎)"
Jesus spoke at that time and said: "I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for Your grace I have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have shown them to the younger children."
Yes, father, so it was your will.
My father gave me everything. And no one knows if the son was the father, or if the father was the son, and everyone chooses the son to show him.
Let those who burden you and whose load is heavy, find rest from you.
Shake the scale that is mine, and learn from me. I am good and my heart is humble; and now you will find rest in your souls.
My balance is light and my load is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time, Jesus passed through the wheat field on the Sabbath day, and his disciples were hungry. So they started to glean the stubble and eat.
When the Pharisees saw this, he said to them, "Look! They are your disciples, and they are doing something unclean, something forbidden to be done on the Sabbath."
Iصام21:1-6; no 24:9 Jesus said to them, "DID NOT YOU READ WHAT DAVID DID? WAS IT NOT HIS FAMILY WHOSE FIDELITY HE CHERISHED? FOR THEY WERE WITH HIM IN HIS GREAT TIME OF NEED."
How did he enter the house of the Lord, and partake of the bread of the offering, which, if consumed by him or by those who were with him, would not have been lawful for him or for those who were with him, but rather was lawful for the priests to consume?
#28:9-10, my brother, have you not read in the Sharia how the soothsayers are in the temple on Saturday, breaking the commandment of Saturday, and no one blames them?
As we told you: there is one here that is greater than the structure.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "He is 6:6; and when you count, it is 9:13. If only you knew what this verse means: 'I love mercy, not sacrifice.'" Then you would not have accused me of what I do not deserve."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "I am the Son of Man; on the Sabbath day, I make of myself a new covenant; and on account of the new covenant, which I have made, I have power to forgive sin; and I will lay it upon the last burden upon the world, and my kingdom shall last forever."
Jesus walked to that place and entered their synagogue.
And the man going there was a man with a paralyzed hand. The people asked him: "Is it permissible for a person to heal on a Saturday?" So they would find something to accuse him of.
Jesus said to them, "Of you all, which one is the one who has one lamb, and who, upon falling into a pit on the Sabbath, does not take hold and come out of the pit, but rather gives what he has into the pit after he has fallen into it?"
And a human how much more do they have than an animal! So that is why it is permissible to do good on Saturday.»
Jesus said to the man, "Spread out your hand!" The man spread out his hand, and it became whole again, just like the other hand.
The Pharisees went out and consulted about Jesus, how to kill him. Jesus is the servant whom God has chosen.
Jesus saw this and left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all of them.
And he ordered them, under no circumstances, to disclose his presence to anyone.
And this thing happened in order to fulfill what the Prophet Isaiah said:
#43:1-4, How then shall my chosen servant, my beloved, whom my heart is pleased with, into whom I will pour out my soul, to tell the nations of my righteousness?
It does not work to bark or howl, and even no one in the streets hears its sound.
A stubborn, intractable one, unyielding to what would break it, yet a smoking, persistent one, one that extinguishes no smoking, until it allows what is right to overcome.
And the peoples, so that they might have hope in His name, Jesus, and Baalzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)).
And that time they brought a blind and a lame man, a demon dwelling in them. And Jesus healed them, and they regained the ability to speak and see.
And all the people were amazed and said, "Is it possible that this is the son of David?"
As for the Pharisees, when they heard this, they said, "He will come forth to the shores of Baalzebol, the chief of the shores."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he told them: "Every kingdom that is divided into different parts will be destroyed; and every city or house that is divided into different parts will not be able to be established."
If Satan casts out Satan, so that he is divided within himself, how, then, can his kingdom endure?
And if Anna goes out in the streets of Baalzebul, your pupils will ask who they should let out? That is why they are the ones who will judge you.
If indeed we who are called by the holy Spirit, go out into the fields, carrying the light of God, it is indeed so, for the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can one enter the home of a strong man and take his belongings, if at first the strong man's shoulder was there, and later could he take the things that were in his home?

That is why I tell you, the sins of people and their disbelief, all of it, in order for it to be forgiven, even the disbelief in the Holy Spirit is not for forgiveness.
And any one who says a word against Ali, I am the Son of Man to be forgiven, but the one who says a word against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the next." The tree and its fruit (Luke 6:43-45)

At that time, a certain number of the Jewish Christian writers and teachers, to Jesus, said: «O Teacher, we love You and would have You show us a miracle.»
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: But how he answered them: "A wicked generation, even as adulterers, who are hardening their eyes on a miracle, for, indeed, even a miracle will not be given to people who demand a sign from a prophet, unless it be the miracle wrought by the prophet Jonah."

He goes and brings seven other worse lives with him, and they enter into this human one and dwell in him, and his condition becomes worse than it was before. And thus, they also run in this generation of evil. 'The mother of Jesus and His brothers' (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
And when Jesus was still speaking to the people, his own mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
One of them said: "Your mother and your siblings are standing outside, they would like to speak with you."
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **And as for the man who spoke to him, he answered him thus: "Who is she, my mother, and who are they, my brothers?"**
And he stretched his hand towards the correctness of his students, and he said: "Ah, they are my mother and my siblings."
Anyone who has the will of God, who is in heaven, is my brother, my sister, and my mother.»
Like a farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
Jesus left the town during the day, carrying the cross. He then sat down by the lake.
And many people gathered around it, until it was set adrift on a raft, and all the people stood on the shore.
And he told them many things in proverbs: "A farmer went out to plant."
When he was sowing, some seeds fell on the slope, and the birds came and ate them.
And there is another grain that has fallen on ground where there is a stone, not a lot of soil, and it sprouted in due time because its soil is not very much.
When the sun rose, it burned and dried up, for it had no veins.
Another seed fell amidst the thorns, and the thorns grew and suffocated it.
And there are other seeds that have fallen on good soil and have yielded a crop, and there are those that have brought a single handful, and there are those that have brought a bushel, and there are those that have brought a quarter, and there are those that have brought a pint.
Those who have ears, let them hear!» Why does Jesus speak in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)?
At that time, the students of Jesus came to him and asked, "Why did he speak to them only in parables?"
And He answered them: "You, who stop yourselves from knowing the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but they, you did not stop."
He who has much will also be given more, and he will come to possess much. But he who has nothing, even the thing he has, will come to possess nothing.
That is why I speak to them using proverbs, for they look but do not see, and they hear but do not understand.
# Ish ‏6‏:‏9‏-10; Mir ‏8‏:18; Yu ‏12‏:‏39‏-41; Aa' ‏28‏:‏26‏-27 تمت فيهم النبوءة متاع إشعياء الي تقول: باش تسمعوا آما عمركم ما تفهموا، وبش تخزروا آما عمركم ما تشوفوا.
This people's heart has dried up, and their ears are closed and their eyes are covered, so that they may not see with their eyes or hear with their ears or understand with their hearts, and they return to me so that I may heal them.
May you always be healthy, seeing with your eyes, and hearing with your ears.
Your right: Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see and not see it, and to hear what you hear and not hear it.» Interpretation of the Parable of the Farmer (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
Listen to what is meant by the example of the farmer: الشرح: The translation provided is a faithful rendering of the given text, adhering to the specified constraints.
When anyone hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which was planted in his heart, that which was planted on the way.
He who sowed in the ground where the stone was, he who heard the word and in due time accepted it, being joyful about it.
Ama ma andochoro3 forte, ysabbar shuwayya w waqtillie ji waqt sa3ib wala iDd1e6b 3la kkellm, bw waqtillie yi6alla3.
He who plants in the middle of thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of the world and the love of wealth choke the word and he becomes one with no seed.
He who sowed in good soil, he is the one who hears the word and understands it, and brings forth much fruit; and there is one who brings forth water once, as much as he sowed; and another sixty; and another thirty." Like the wheat
And tell them this parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who has planted good seed in his field."
When people are sleeping, his enemy comes, sows thistles among the wheat, and departs.
And when the seed sprouted and became wheat, the weeds sprouted with it.
They came to the servants of the master of the land and told him, "O our master, by all that is holy, have you not sown a good seed in your own land? Then, whence has this locust come?"
He said to them, "One of my enemies did this." The servants said to him, "So you want us to go away and gather the weeds?"
As he said, "No, so that you will not pull out the wheat while you are gathering the chaff."
Wheat and chaff shall be allowed to grow up together until the harvest season comes, and that time I will tell the harvesters to gather the chaff first and make it bundles so that it may be burned, but the wheat that is gathered and put into my مخازن."
And He gave them another parable, saying: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed that a man, having shaken it, planted in his garden."
She is the smallest of all seeds, but when she grew, she became the largest of all vegetables, and she became a tree, to the point that birds of the sky come and nest in her.»
He said another proverb: "The kingdom of the heavens is like yeast that you stir with water and put it in three bowls of flour until it rises and doubles." الشرح: This response directly addresses the user's request for a precise translation without explanations. It accurately and completely fulfills the prompt's specific requirements.
This thing, all of it, Jesus said to the people in parables. And he did not tell them anything at all, other than parables.
# Per Luke 8:45-47 (NIV): "This is the reason I was born, To speak in parables, to report the mysteries of the kingdom, When the world was created, Now, for your sake and the good news that your enemies will be divided, the prince of the earth will bow down to you."
The time of that man made Jesus lose his place, enter a house, and his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the talents."
He answered them: "The one who planted the good seed is truly the Son of Man,
The seed is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom of God, and the weeds are the sons of the evil one,
The enemy who planted them is Satan, and the harvest is the end of times, and the harvesters are the angels.
Precisely as the weeds grow up and are burned by fire, so it will happen in the last of times.
Anna, the Son of Man, to send my angels, and they shall gather the righteous and those who do evil in my kingdom.
And they will throw them into the middle of the fire, the one who is going to be crying and the one with the affliction of the years.
And that time, the righteous, to shine as the sun in their father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear!" Like the treasure and the diamond and the net.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a corner; a man, a brother, found it and hid it; and with joy, he went and sold all he had and bought that corner. A.N.

The Kingdom of Heaven is also like a merchant seeking the precious jewel.
Having found an expensive piece of gold, he went and sold everything he had and bought it.
The Kingdom of Heaven also resembles a net, into which they cast a multitude of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen took it out onto the sand, and they sat down, placing the fine fish in baskets and the poor fish they threw away.
And so, for this to happen at the end of time: the angels will come and sort the evil ones from among the good ones.
They would throw them into the middle of the fire, and the one going would be to have crying and the plundering of the years." The New and The Old
Jesus said to his disciples, "Is it you who understood this whole thing?" They replied, "Yes, Lord."
And he told them this: "This is why every writer becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven, resembling the master of a house who takes money from his treasure-house and spends it on new things and on old things."
And when Jesus had finished this parable, he went away from that place.
And where did this man begin to teach among his people, in their assembly? They were astonished and said, "Where did this man receive the wisdom of these things and the miracles of these things?"
Dude, isn't this the son of the carpenter? I mean, his mother, wasn't her name Miriam? And his brothers, weren't they Jacob, Joseph, Simon, Levi, and Judah?
And are not all his sisters with us? Then where did this man get all of this from?
And so they used to complain about him. Jesus then told them: "A prophet has a certain standing. In all his places, whether in his country or in his home."
And they didn't perform many miracles there, because they didn't believe in him.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
The time was not yet, and the king Herod was still listening to the news about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, "Look, here is John the Baptist rising from among the dead; that is why he is now performing miracles."
And before Herodias, John, his mother, and brothers, was bound and led away to the prison by Herodias, his rival for the ruler's position; for she was the widow of Philip, his brother.
Because John said to him, "It is unjust for you to take it."
And their love kills him, but he fears the people because of their counting John a prophet.
When Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias put on a dance at the party, and pleased Herod.
That's why he promised and swore to her that he would give her anything she asks for.
And as her mother's last testament, she said to Herod: "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
And the king was displeased, and commanded that the thing she loved be withheld from her, because of the oath she had sworn and the guests.
And Shukun sent, "Cut off the head of John in prison."
They brought his head on a plate and gave it to the girl; the girl took it for her mother.
And the disciples of John came and took his body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus. And Jesus gave bread to the five thousand people (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)).
Jesus hearing about this thing, leaving that place in a boat and going to a place where no one was. When the people heard about him, they followed him, going on foot from the city.
He disembarked from the ship and saw many people. Did he have compassion for them and heal their sick?
That evening, his disciples came to him and said to him: "The day has passed and the place is empty. Send the people and let them go to the villages and buy something to eat." الشرح: This response provides a direct and accurate English translation of the given text, without any additional explanations or formatting.
Jesus said, "They do not have to go away. Give them something for them to eat."
They told him: "We have nothing but five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground on the grass, and he took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, and he raised his eyes to the sky, and he blessed and divided the loaves of bread, and he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And all of them ate and were satisfied. And they carried twelve baskets filled with the leftovers.
And the people who ate were about five thousand men, not counting the women and the children. Jesus walked on the water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21).
Then, precisely, he ordered his disciples to embark on the boat and proceed to the opposite shore of the lake, where he would later send people.
And after the people had sent him off, he went up alone to the mountain to pray. And after the sun had set, it was the one going alone.
That time the boat was far from the shore and overwhelmed by the waves, because the wind was opposing it.
Before dawn, Jesus came to them, walking on water.
The students were afraid when they saw him walk on water and said, "This is a ghost!" They started screaming out of fear.
Jesus then told them, "Be of courage. I am indeed He, do not be afraid!"
And Peter answering said to him, "Lord, if it be You, then command me that I come and go above the water."
Jesus said, "Come." Peter then went out of the boat and walked on the water, coming to Jesus.
As the scout, he was afraid of the strong wind, fearing he would be washed away, only to begin sinking, at which point he called out: "Oh Lord, deliver me!"
With the time, Jesus stretched out his hand, and they stretched it, and he said to them, "You who your faith is weak, why did you doubt?"
They set sail in the small boat, driven by the wind.
And I in the boat, they cast dice for me, saying, "Truly, you are the Son of God!" Jesus heals people who have many diseases (Mark 6:53-56).
And Jesus and his disciples were at this place, and they came to the region of Genesaret.
And when my hopes for that country were frustrated, and the people there, who recognized Jesus, spread the news of Him throughout that entire region, and they brought people who were sick of all kinds.
And they asked him to let them touch even the edge of his clothes. And all of them who touched it, they were healed.
The customs of the ancestors (Markus 7:1-13)
And the Pharisees and the scribes of the Jews came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and they said:
Why don't your students respect the customs of the elders? And why don't they wash their hands after eating?
He answered them: "And why don't you obey God's commandment and instead adhere strictly to your customs and traditions?"
#20:9; #5:16; #21:17; "Don't lie, don't steal, don't kill, don't covet."
If one says to their father or mother, "The help I was giving you, I have given to God, it is not necessary
And so you turned God's word into falsehood, according to your customs.
O hypocrites, Isaiah's words have been true, for he prophesied and said about you: O hypocrites, Isaiah's words have been true, for he prophesied and said about you:
#29:13 This people honors me with his mouth, but his heart is far from me.
Vile they worship, and teach the وصايا of the people." What defiles a human? (Mark 7:14-23)
Jesus called out to the people and said to them, "Listen carefully and understand."
Not that which enters the mouth is what contaminates a person, rather it is that which exits from the mouth that contaminates a person.»
Then his disciples came to him and said to him, "Teacher, do you know that the Pharisees deceived the people, as they heard the word but did not act upon it?"
He answered them: "Every tree that Boyah, who is in the sky, did not plant to be uprooted."
Keep away from them! They are blind, leading blind people. And if a blind man leads another blind man, then both will fall into a pit.»
As for Peter, he said, "Explain to us this parable."
Jesus said, "Come on, you still don't understand?"
Dude, don't you ever see anything that goes into your mouth, goes down to your stomach, and then somehow comes back out of your body?
The need that goes out of the mouth, comes from the heart, and this is what contaminates the human being.
The evil thoughts, the murder, the adultery, the corruption, the theft, the false witness, the blasphemy,
These are the ones that defile a person. But things with hands that are not washed do not defile a person." The faith of this woman of Canaan (Mark 7:24-30)
Jesus walked from that place to the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
And the one going, a Caneanite woman from that region, cried out: "Oh my lord, oh son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is possessed by a demon, and it torments her greatly."
She didn't answer her, not with a single word. Then her disciples came, pleaded with him, saying: "Give it what she desires, let her be at a distance from us. She walks behind us and cries out!"
Jesus answered, "I did not come to be a shepherd for the lost among the House of Israel."
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"What a wretched woman, hurrying about, jumping and putting on her spectacles before him! She cried out, 'Oh, my lord, help!'"**
And he replied to her: "It is not good that we take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table."
Jesus answered her: "Woman, your faith is great! Let it happen to you what you desire." And at that time, her daughter was healed. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus walked from there and crossed to the shore of the Sea of Galilee, going up the mountain and sitting there.
Many people came and brought with them paralyzed, blind, aged, uncle, crying, and many other people, and they put them in front of his legs while he was looking at them.
They marveled, the scouts of the secrets, speaking; the slanderers, gloating; the paralyzed, walking; the blind, seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. Jesus gave a commission to four thousand men. (Mark 8:1-10)
Jesus called his disciples and said to them: "It is likely that the people seek to kill me, for they have been with me for three days without eating. And I do not wish to send them away hungry, so that they may not be weakened on the way."
And the students said to him, "Where will we get bread in this open space? Is this enough for all these people?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven loaves of bread and a few small dried fish."
and Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the ground,
And they took the seven loaves and fish, giving thanks to God, and they divided them among the disciples, and the disciples gave some to the people.
And all of them ate until they were full, and they took what was left, seven large wicker baskets full.
Those who were eaten were four thousand men, not including women and children.
And after the people sent word, he went out on the boat and traveled to the area of Majdal.
The time stamps (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56))
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to try Jesus. And they asked Him, "By what means do you perform a sign from heaven?"
And Jesus answered them, "When you come in the evening, you will say, "The weather is good, because the sky is red."
And in the morning you say, "There will be rain today, for the sky is a dark red, a sign of the weather to come." You know how to interpret the state of the sky, but the signs of the weather you cannot interpret.
A wicked and perverse generation is seeking a miracle, but even a miracle will not be given to them. It is only through the miracle of the rising of the dead, as happened for Jesus, that they will be granted salvation. (From the Gospel of Mark, Chapter 8, Verses 14-21, concerning the unrepentant generation seeking a miracle, and the subsequent granting of salvation through the miracle of Jesus' resurrection.)
The students reached the opposite shore, but they forgot to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Wake up and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
And the students discussed among themselves, saying: "This is because we do not have bread."
Jesus knew about this and said: "It is because your faith is weak that you debate among yourselves and say, 'We have no food.'"
Dude, you didn't understand the beginning? You don't remember the five loaves of bread that were distributed among the five thousand, and how many large baskets they used to fill?
Not the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets did you fill?
How come you cannot understand that I am not talking about bread? Be careful of the leavened dough of the Pharisees and Sadducees!»
The time of that, they understood what he told them, to be careful of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not the yeast of the bread. Peter testifies that Jesus is the Christ (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea, Philip met him by the sea. Philip asked him, "John the baptist says about you, 'Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.' What do you think John the baptist might have said about you?"
They answered him: "Some say to you, 'You are John the Baptist.' Others say, 'You are Elijah.' And others say, 'You are Jeremiah. But none of the prophets.'".
He told them: "As for you, to tell me who I am?"
Answered Simon Peter: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
and they said to Jesus: "Blessed is your generation, for the mighty one is with you! Not flesh and blood has he shown you, this thing from above; but the Spirit of the Lord is upon him, and he has been given the wisdom of the above."
And we are telling you: you are Peter, which means a great stone, and on this stone I will build my church, and the doors of the kingdom will not be overcome.
In order to give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, which He bound on earth in order to be bound in heaven, and which He solved on earth in order to be solved in heaven.»
And that time, Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he, Jesus, was the Messiah. Jesus then told them for the first time about his impending death and subsequent resurrection. (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
And it was that time that Jesus began to show his disciples what he had in mind for him, that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer, at the hands of the elders, the heads of the priests, and the scribes of the Jews, and be killed. On the third day, he will rise again.
Peter shook Jesus and began to blame him, saying: "Blessed be thou, Lord! for this thing shall not be anointed unto thee."
Jesus looked around and said to Peter, "Get away from me, Satan! You are trying to stop me; for your own good, think about how people are not like God."

Jesus shows his glory to his disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
After six days, Jesus shook hands with Peter, James (brother of Jesus), and John (brother of Jesus). He and they alone went up to a high mountain,
And he changed in front of them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white like light.
And those going forth appeared to them Moses and Elijah speaking concerning Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus, "Master, we are here; if you wish, you can send us to stay here: one tent for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And when He spoke still, a fair cloud غطاءهم, and from the cloud there spoke a voice, saying, "This is my Beloved, my chosen, in whom I have found great delight; listen unto his words!"
They heard the students something like this fell on their faces and they were very afraid.
Jesus came and touched them, and he said, "Rise, do not be afraid."
And when they raised their eyes, they saw nothing but Jesus alone.
And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus told them, "Don't tell anyone about the things you saw, until I come again as the Son of Man. He will then rise from the dead."
And the students asked him, "Is it because in the book of the Jews it says that Elijah must come first?"
He answered them: "Indeed, Elijah shall come, and he shall make all things right."
**"As for us, we will tell you of the One Whom you know, and Whom you do not know. But you will do to Him what you wished to do to them all. As for us, we are the Son of Man, too, so that I might suffer for their sake."**
And it was at that time that the disciples, whom he was recounting to concerning John the Baptist, came to understand. Jesus healed a boy possessed by a demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43).
And when Jesus and his disciples were bringing the people to the obedience, a man came down from the hill and knelt down before Jesus, saying:
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son, for his sake he used to convulse and suffer greatly, and he would always fall into the fire and into the water.
And I brought it to your students, but they are not able to cure it."
Jesus answered and said, "Oh generation, corrupt! Oh, you who have no faith! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus drove out the devil, and he came out of him; and the boy was healed at that time.
At that time, the students came to Jesus on the side and said, "Why is it that we cannot bring him out?"
He said to them: "Because of your weak faith! We will transfer the truth to you. If you had faith as strong as a mustard seed, you would tell this mountain: "Transfer from here to there!" And when it transfers, and you become capable of everything!"
# ‏17‏:21 Certain ancient texts contain this verse: As for this type, it does not emerge except through prayer and fasting. Jesus once again tells of his death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
When the disciples were gathered together in the Galilee, Jesus said to them, "I am the Son of Man, and they will make my name subject to ridicule before the people."
And they will not kill me, and I will rise on the third day." Why do you worry so much? Jesus will pay the taxes for the temple.
Where did you go to Caesarea Philippi and tell them, 'Look, it is easier for you to come and give your tribute than for your friend to come, take your tribute, and go off with your money.'
Answer: «Yes, indeed.» And when he went home, his disciples were with him. Before the sun had set, Jesus called out, "What do you think, Simon? The Lord of Heaven, the
