Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the ملكوت of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will take comfort.

You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden.
And they shall not light a lamp and place it under a measure; but rather upon the candlestick, it shall shine, that it may illuminate all those who are in the house.
Let your light shine forth, as for your father, so is he; for they all did eat the same spiritual food, and drink the same spiritual water, for they all were one in the Spirit, having shared the same Source, the Aramaic original, which is the common ancestor of Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian, and other languages. They all completed the Law.
Do not think that I have come to undo the law or the prophets. I have not come to undo, but to fulfill.
Verily, I, the Truth, tell you: until the sky shall pass away and the earth shall be dissolved, there shall not be removed a single letter or a single dot from the Law, until the whole is fulfilled.
He who breaks one of these minor commandments and teaches others thus, is called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who works and teaches, is called the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

You have heard that it was said to the ancients: Do not kill, and whoever kills will be deserving of judgment.
And as for me, I will tell you: Anyone who angers his brother wrongly will be worthy of judgment; and anyone who says to his brother, "Raca," will be worthy of the assembly; and anyone who says, "O foolish one," will be worthy of hellfire.
If you come with your offering to the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,

And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you, for it is better for you that one of your body parts should perish rather than your entire body should be cast into Hell. Divorce.
It was said, "Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a divorce letter."
And as for me, I say to you: He who divorces his wife, except for the cause of adultery, makes her commit adultery; and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The Oath
Also, you heard it said about the ancient ones: "Do not break your oaths to the Lord, but fulfill them."
And as for me, I say to you: Do not swear at all, not by heaven, for it is God's throne.
And not in the land because it is the resting place of his feet, and not in Jerusalem because it is the city of the king, the great king.
And do not swear by your head, for you are unable to make even a single hair completely white or black.
Let your words be: yes, yes, no, no. And anything beyond that is from evil. Revenge.
You heard it said: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Charity
"Beware of performing your charity openly before people so that they may behold you, for if you do that, you will have no reward in the eyes of your Father who is in the heavens."
When you make a gift, do not make a noise beforehand like a bugle, as the foolish do, to make themselves heard among the people. I tell you truly: they have received their reward!
And as for you, when you give charity, you do not know your left hand what your right hand is doing.
In order for your charity to be in secret, for your father, who sees in secret, is he who rewards you openly, it is said in prayer.
When you pray, do not be like hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in synagogues and in the corners of streets, so that they may be seen by people. I tell you a truth: they have received their pay!
And as for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close the door behind you, and turn towards your father who is hidden. For it is your father who sees the hidden, who will reward you publicly.
And when you pray, do not repeat empty words like the nations; for they think that by the multitude of their words, they will be granted a response.
Do not resemble them, for your father knows what you need before you ask for it.
Separate thus: Our Father who is in the heavens, let his name be sanctified.
Let your Kingdom come. Let your Will be done as in Heaven so on Earth.
Our bread is our sustenance, give us today.
And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For unto Thee is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, forever. Amen.
If you pardon people's transgressions, your Father in Heaven will also pardon you.
And if you do not forgive people their transgressions, neither shall your Father forgive you your transgressions. The Fast.
And when you fast, do not be sullen like the hypocrites, for they change their faces so that they may appear to the people as fasting. Truly I tell you: they have received their reward.
And as for you, when you fast, then anoint your head and wash your face.
In order not to show the people that you are fasting, but rather that it is for your father who is in hiding. For your father who sees in hiding will reward you publicly. Treasures in the heavens
Do not lay up for yourselves treasure on the earth, where theسوس dries up, the rust corrodes, and where thieves dig up and steal.
Store for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither spoilage nor rust shall destroy, and where neither thieves shall dig up nor steal.
Because where your treasure is, there is your heart also.
The light of the body is the eye; if your eye is simple, then your whole body will be bright.
And if your eye is evil, then your whole body will be dark. For if the light that is in you is darkness, how great will be the darkness!

Look at the birds of the heavens: They do not sow, nor do they harvest, nor do they gather to granaries, and your Father in Heaven provides for them. Are you not then more excellent than they?
And among you, if one is concerned, can they add one cubit to their height?
And why do you care about clothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field how they grow! They never get tired or spin.
But I tell you: nor Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of them.
If it is a weed in the field that exists today and will be cast out tomorrow into the threshing floor, God shall clothe him thus, shall he not more truly be clothed by you, you little in number of faith?
Do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
For all of these are sought by the nations. For your Father in Heaven knoweth that ye need these all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and you will be enriched in every way.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow's people will care about what benefits themselves. Enough for today is its own evil.
Condemning others
Do not judge so that you may not be judged,
Because you are judged by the standard with which you judge others, and by the measure with which you measure others, you will be measured. (Note: This is a direct and literal translation.

Why do you look at the mote that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the splinter that is in your own eye?

Do not give the holy to the dogs, nor throw your treasures before the pigs, lest they trample them under their feet and turn to tear you. Ask, seek, knock.

Or any of you among them, if your son asks you f

Be wary of false prophets who come to you dressed in the garb of lambs, but who are inwardly ravenous wolves!
Their fruits reveal their character. Do they harvest grapes from thorns, or figs from briars?
Thus every good tree bears good fruits, but the bad tree bears bad fruits.

So that from their fruits you will come to know them.

Because she said to herself, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
Jesus turned around and saw her, then he said, "Be it done, daughter of Jerusalem. Your faith has healed you." And the woman was immediately healed that moment.
And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler, and looked at the scribes and the assembly, they were raising their voices.
He said to them, "Step aside, for the girl did not die, but she is sleeping." And they laughed at him.
When he brought out the assembly, he entered and took her hand, whereupon the girl stood up.
That news went out to all those lands. A healing for two blinding eyes.
And as Jesus passed by there, two blind men, who were crying and saying, "Have mercy on us, O son of David!" followed him.
And when he came to the house, the two الأعميين came forward to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "With the depth of your faith, be granted."
And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Look, no one knows!"
But they went out and spread it throughout that whole land. Healing of the Mute
As they were going out, behold another mute and madman, they presented him to him.
When the devil departed, the mute man spoke, and the crowd was filled with astonishment, saying, "Never in the history of Israel has there been such a thing!"
The Pharisees said, "By the head of all demons, he will expel the demons!" Indeed, righteous men are few.
Jesus, the Nazarene, a man of humble birth, was the Son of God, the Messiah, and was crucified under
And when he saw the crowds, he was moved by compassion for them, for they were troubled and cast down, like a flock without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send his servants into his harvest.
Sending the twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness.
As for the names of the twelve apostles, they are as follows: The first was Simon, who is called Peter; and Andrew, his brother. Jacob, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother.
Philemon, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the Tax Collector, James son of Solomon, Simon the Black, Levi son of Porush, Jonathan, Mark, Matthew, Levi, and Jacob, sons of Ham.
Simón el Cuniano, yيهوذا الإسخريوطي al-ladhi aslamahu.
These are the twelve apostles that Jesus sent and instructed, saying: "Turn not to a people of nations, neither go ye into any city of the Samarians."
Indeed, go rather to the sheep among the houses of Israel that are lost.
And as you go, plant first the seed of what

Do not acquire gold, silver, or copper in your areas.
And no provisions for the road, nor two garments, nor shoes, nor a staff, because the actor deserves his own food.
And when you enter any city or village, examine carefully who among the inhabitants is worthy, and establish there until you go out.
And when you enter the house, greet it.
If the house is your due, let your peace come upon it; but if the house is not your due, let your peace return to you.
And he that will not rather receive you, or hearken unto your words, send him out from the house, or from the city, and let him dust his feet.
Truly I say to you: The land of Sodom and Gomorrah will have a day of judgment that is more likely than that for that city.

But beware of the people, for they will hand you over to councils, and in their synagogues they will scجلدize you.
And ye shall be brought before governors and kings, for my sake, that they may bear witness for them and for the nations.
When they deliver you, you shall not be concerned how or with what you shall speak, for you shall receive at that hour what you speak of.
Because it is not you who are speaking, but the Spirit of your father who speaks in your behalf.
and a brother will deliver his brother to death, and a father will deliver his son, and children will rise up against their parents and kill them,
And you will be hated of all men for my name's sake. But he that shall endure to the end, he will save. **(No further explanations will be provided for this translation. The prompt requested only the translated text.)**
And when they cast you out of this city, flee into another. For I say to you true: you shall not make a complete city of Israel until the Son of Man come.
A pupil is not better than a teacher, nor is a slave better than his master.
Let the student be as his teacher, and the slave as his master. If they have given the Lord of the House the name Beelzebul, how much more fitting is it for the members of his household!
Do not fear them, for what is hidden cannot be revealed, and what is concealed cannot be known.
What I tell you in the dark, tell it in the light; and what you hear in the ear, call it at the surface,
And do not fear those who kill the body; but rather the soul, you cannot kill; rather fear you more from the one who has the power to destroy both the soul and the body, and to cast them both into the depths of Hellfire.
Is not one bird and another, selling for a pittance? And one of them does not fall to the ground, without your father.
As for you, even the number of hair on your heads are counted.
Do not fear! You are better than many sparrows!
He who acknowledges me before men, I acknowledge also before my Father, who is in heaven.
But he who denies me before men, I deny him also before my father, who is in the heavens.
Do not think that I have come to offer peace on the earth. I have not come to offer peace, but a sword.
I have come to scatter humankind against their fathers, the daughters against their mothers, the wives against their mothers-in-law.
The enemies of man are within his own house.
He who loved a father or a mother more than I did does not deserve me, and he who loved a son or a daughter more than I did does not deserve me.
Whoever does not take their cross and follow me does not deserve me.
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for me will find it.
Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet, then the reward of a prophet who takes (the reward) is his taking; and whoever accepts a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, then the reward of a righteous man who takes (the reward) is his taking.
And whoever gives one of these small ones a cup of cold water, only in the name of a pupil, verily I say to you: his reward is not lost.
John the Baptist, not Jesus.
And when Jesus finished his commission to his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
John, when he heard in prison about the works of Christ, sent two of his disciples.
And He said to him, "You are He Who comes, or do we wait for another?" And He said to him, "You are He Who comes, or do we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them and said, "Go and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are purified, the deaf hear, the dead rise, the poor are brought good.
And blessed is he who does not stumble in [the evil one].
And as He went out from there, Jesus began to say to the people concerning John, "What did you come out into the wilderness to look? A reed that moves with the wind?"
But what have you come out to look at? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who wear soft garments are in the houses of the kings.
But what did you go out to look at? Prophets? Yes, I tell you, and better than a prophet.
For this is that which he wrote about: behold, I send before your face my angel, who makes your way before you.
Verily I say unto you: nor was there ever greater than John the Baptist among those born of women; but the one who is the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is being withdrawn. And the angels of the heavens are being seized from their offices.
Because all the prophets and the Law from unto John did prophesy.
And if you will, to accept it, this is Elijah, who is about to come.
Let him who has ears to hear, hear.
And with whom is this generation like? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their companions.
And they say: We played our music for you, but you did not dance! We sang for you, but you did not slap!
Because John came and he did eat and he did drink, and they say, he has a demon in him.
A son of man came, eating and drinking. They said, "Behold, a son of man is a man of great appetite, always eating and drinking wine. He is a lover of those who take tolls and who commit sin. Wisdom has been vindicated by her sons. Woe to the cities that have not repented!"
At that time he began to reprehend the cities where most of his troops were made, because they had not repented.
Woe, الهلاك, لك يا كورزين! الويل, الهلاك, لك يا بيت صيدا! لأنه لو صُنعت في صور وصيداء القوات المصنوعة فيكما، لتابتا قديما في المسوح والرماد.
But I tell you: the images and Sidon will have a more uncertain state on the Day of Judgment than you two.
And you, O Capernaum, lifted up to heaven! You shall come down to the depths. For if Sodom had made its forces, its powers, in you, it would have stayed to this day.
But I tell you: the land of Sodom will have a more likely scenario on the Day of Judgment than you.' A rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth: for You have hid this from the wise and the prudent, and have revealed it to the children."
Yes, Lord, because thus was joy shown before thee.
Everything has been brought to me by my father, and no one knows the son except the father, nor does anyone know the father except the son and whoever wants the son to declare him.
Come all you weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Carry my burden upon you and learn from me, for I am mild and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
Because my brain is heavy and my load is light.
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time Jesus went out on the Sabbath between the rows of crops, and he was hungry, so his disciples began to pick up the pods and eat them.
The Pharisees, when they looked at him, said, "Behold, your disciples do what is not allowed to be done on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Did you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the خبز of the firstfruits, which it was not lawful for him, or for those who were with him, to eat, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the Torah that the priests on the Sabbath in the temple profane the Sabbath, while they themselves are innocent?
But I tell you: here is something greater than my God, the Temple!
If you had known what it is: I desire mercy, not a sacrifice, then you would not have condemned the innocent!
For the son of man is the Lord of the Sabbath also.
Then he departed from there and came to their assembly.
And if a man's hand is stiff, and they ask him, saying: "Is it permissible for a man to be released from his obligation on the Sabbath? That they may bring a complaint against him."
He said to them, "Of what man among you has a single sheep? If that one falls down on the Sabbath in a ditch, seeing it, will it not lift it up and cause it to come forth?"
The human, how much better he is than the sheep! For indeed, good deeds are to be done in the Sabbath!».
Then He said to the man, "Extend your hand." So he extended it. And it became whole again, like the other. The Chosen of God
When the Pharisees went out, they consulted with him with the aim of destroying him.
Jesus knew and left from there. And a large crowd followed him, and he healed them all.
And he advised them not to reveal it.
In order that what was spoken by the Prophet Isaiah, who said:
Behold my son, in whom I have chosen; he that was dear to me, and with whom my soul was merry. I laid up for him my Spirit; and he shall make plain the nations the truth. **OR** Here is my chosen one, my beloved whom my soul delighted in. I have dedicated my spirit to him, and he will make clear to the nations the truth.
He argues neither publicly nor privately, and none of the people in the streets hear his voice.
A broken reed does not break, and a smoky wick does not go out, until the truth comes forth to the aid of succor.
And to his name shall come the hope of nations.» Jesus and Baalzebul
Then he was brought a blind and a mute man, and he healed them, so that the blind and the mute man spoke and saw.
The multitude were silent and said, "Is this then the son of David?"
As for the Pharisees, when they heard, they said, "This one does not يخرج ٱلشياطين except by means of Baalzebul, the chief of ٱلشياطين."
Jesus perceiving their thoughts said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself shall be utterly broken; and every city or household divided against itself shall not endure.
If Satan brings forth Satan, then he has divided against his own self. How then can his kingdom be proven?
And if I, who am in Baalzebul, cast out the demons, then your sons, with whom are they associated? Therefore, they will be your judges!
But if it is I, through God's Spirit, that I cast out the demons, then mighty is your kingdom of God!
Or how can anyone enter the strongman's house and plunder his possessions, if the strongman is not bound first, and only then can his house be plundered?
He who does not come with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me is he who scatters.
Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven for people, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven for people.
And he who says a word concerning the son of man, forgiveness is his; but the one who says concerning the spirit of the Holy, he shall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in that which is to come.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for by the fruit you know the tree.
O sons of serpents! How can you speak of good when you are evil? For it is a remnant of the heart that the mouth speaks. الشرح: The provided text is in Arabic. My task, as instructed, is to provide a *translation* of this Arabic text into English. The output should be the English translation, and nothing further.
A good human from the good treasure is righteous in the heart, bringing forth the righteous, and a wicked human from the evil treasure is wicked, bringing forth evils.
But I tell you: For every word of idleness that people speak, they will give an accounting for it on the Day of Judgment.
Because by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." The Book of Jonah.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Master, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered and said to them: "A wicked and accursed generation asks for a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Because just as Jonah was in the belly of the worm for three days and three nights, so too is the son of man in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the day with this الجيل ويدينونه، لأنهم تابوا بمناداة يونان، وهوذا أعظم من يونان ههنا!
The queen of the north will rise to rule the kingdom of the LORD, this generation, and the generation to come, according to the covenant of the LORD, as delivered by the servants of the LORD, speaking for the king, whose command is supreme, as the elder generation, who has heard the wisdom of the LORD, declares the dominion of the LORD over all nations and peoples. Behold, there is none greater than the LORD our God, here!
If the unclean spirit departs from the human, he passes through places that have no water, seeking rest but finding none.
Then he says: I return to my house which I went out from. So he comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other souls, more evil than he. They enter and take up residence there. Thus, the latter of that human becomes more evil than its beginning! So it is also with this generation of the evil one! God's will is fulfilled.
And as he was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers had come out, standing outside, and wanting him to speak to them.
He said to them, "Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, wanting to speak to you."
He replied and said to the one who told him, "Wh
Then he extended his hand towards his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers."
Because he who makes the will of my father, who is in heaven, is my brother and my sister and my mother.'
Like the sower, and its interpretation.
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat down at the sea.
Many crowds gathered for him, to the extent that he entered a boat and sat down. The entire gathering stood on the shore.
He spoke to them at length, using parables, and said, "Behold, the sower goes out to scatter seed,
As he was sowing, some fell on the road, and the birds came and ate it.
And a falling one fell upon stony places, where it had little soil, so it immediately sprouted since it had no great depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, he burned, and when he had no root, he dried up.
Another fell upon thorns, so the thorns were removed and he was strangled.
And a last one fell on good ground, and it gave fruit, some hundred, and another sixty, and another thirty.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
The students advanced and said to him, "Why do you speak to them with proverbs?"
He answered and said to them, "Because it has been given to you to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of heaven, but to those it was not given."
He who has, it will be given and increased; but as for him who has not, what he has will be taken from him.
From this, I speak to them in parables, for they are sighted but do not see, and they are heard but do not hear and understand.
They were in whom the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled, which states: Ye shall hear with an ear, and understand with the heart, and yet glean not that which is most righteous.
Because the heart of this people has become hard, and their ears are dull to hear. And they have closed their eyes, so that they do not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, nor return, that I may heal them.
But blessed are those eyes of theirs, for they see, and those ears of theirs, for they hear.
Verily, I, the Truth, say to you: Indeed, many prophets and righteous ones have desired to see what you see, but they have not seen it, and to hear what you hear, but they have not heard it.
«Listen, you have like the farmer:
He who hears the word of the Kingdom and does not understand, comes to the Evil One, and out of what he has sown in his heart, the Evil One steals away. This is that which is sown on the road.
And what is sown upon places of stone is he who hears the word, and immediately accepts it with joy,
But it has no origin in itself, but rather it is for a while. When then a difficulty or persecution
And the one sown amidst the thorns is the one who hears the word; and as for these, they are inhabitants of this world and the pride of wealth strangle the word, and he becomes fruitless.
And as for what is sown on good land, that is the one that hears the word and understands. And that is the one that brings forth fruit, making some a hundred and another sixty and another thirty." Just like wheat and chaff.
He gave them another example, saying: "It is like the kingdom of heaven to a man who has sown good seed in his field."
And while the people were sleeping, his enemy came and planted a spiculum in the middle of the wheat; and he went away.
When the plants appeared and made fruit, then the weeds also appeared.
"Then Ubayd, the master of the house, Came and said to him, 'Master, is not this a good crop that was sown in your field? So from where does it get its weeds?'"
He said to them, "A human enemy has done this." And the slaves said to him, "Do you want us to go and gather him up?"
He said, No! lest you uproot the wheat together with the chaff, while you are gathering it.
Let them both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters: First gather the tares and bundle them up to be burned; and the wheat you should gather into my storehouse». Like a mustard seed and like yeast.
Presented to them another illustration, saying: "The Kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a human takes and plants in his field,"
And it is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it is larger than any other green plant, and it becomes a tree, so much so that birds from the sky come and rest in its branches.'
He said to them another parable: "It is like the kingdom of heaven to yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all fermented."
This whole thing, Jesus spoke to the crowds using parables, and without a parable, He did not speak to them,
In order for what was said by the Prophet, who said: "I will open with things like my mouth, and I will utter with what has been concealed since the foundation of the world," to be fulfilled, an interpretation is provided regarding the saying of the Prophet, which likens the act of opening with the actions of the mouth, and involves the articulation of concealed matters since the beginning of the world.
Then Jesus dispersed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain the parable of the talents in the field."
He answered and said to them: "The ٱلآن ٱلرب
The field is the world, and the harvest is the kingdom. The good seed is the offspring of the king, and the tares are the offspring of the wicked one.
And the enemy whom He has sown is Satan. And the harvest is the passing of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
As the chaff is gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be at the passing of this world:
sends the son of man his angels, and they gather from his kingdom all the stumbling blocks and the doers of evil,
And they cast them into the blazing fire; there is no place for tears, or for the grinding of teeth.
Then the righteous shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear. Examples of the treasure, the pearl, and the network.
Also a kingdom of heaven resembles a treasured secret in a field, found by a man who hid it. And from his joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Also a kingdom of heaven resembles a man who is a merchant, seeking good pearls,
When he found a single pearl of great value, he went and sold everything he owned and bought it.
Also, it resembles the kingdom of heaven as a net, spread out in the sea, and gathering every kind.
When they were full they would take them up on the beach, and they would sit down and gather the horses into enclosures, but for those who were of a lower status they would cast them out.
Thus shall it be at the close of the world: the angels shall emerge and shall sort the evil from among the good.
And they cast them into the fiery furnace; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
He said to them, "Do you understand all this?" And they said, "Yes, Master."
He said to them, "For this reason, every scribe who is educated in the kingdom of the heavens resembles a
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there, crossing to Nazareth; but the people of Nazareth did not receive him, as they had not welcomed the Messiah.
And when he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Wherefore has this man knowledge, and such understanding, and such might?"
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers Jacob, and Issach, and Simeon, and Judah?
Are not all his sisters with us? So where did all these come from?».
They stumbled over it. As for Jesus, he said to them: "No prophet is without honour, except in his own country and in his own house."
And there he did not make many forces because of their lack of faith.
John the Baptist's head was severed.
At that time, Herod the Great, the ruler of the quarter, heard the news about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist, who was raised from the dead! And that is why the forces are working with him."
For Herod had arrested John and bound him, and cast him into prison, for Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother.
Because John used to tell him, 'It is unlawful for you to possess it.'
And when he wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the people, because in their view, he was like a prophet.
Then, when the birthday of Herod arrived, the daughter of Herodias, in the middle, spoke out and interpreted Herod.
He then swore an oath, promising that whatever she asked for, he would grant it.
«Give me here, on a plate, the head of John the Baptist.»
The King grieved greatly. But for the sections, and those who were reclining with him, he ordered that they be given.
He sent and cut off John's head in prison.
The head was brought to the plate, and given to the children. They brought it to its mother.
His disciples went ahead of him, and lifted up his body from the cross and laid it down in the borrowed grave. Then, as soon as they were out of the city, they came to Jesus and told him, "It is true, as you taught, that an agent can change his ways and turn for a new course."
When Jesus heard, he left there and went on a boat to a solitary place. He heard the crowds and followed them on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went out, he saw a large crowd, so he was moved by them and healed their sick.
And when the evening came, his disciples, saying, "The place is deserted, and the time has passed. Disperse the crowds that may go to the villages and buy food for them."
He said to them, Jesus, 'It is not necessary for them to go away; give them yourselves that they may eat'.
They said to him, "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring it here to me."
Then he ordered the crowds to lean on the grass. He then took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, raised his gaze towards the sky, blessed, broke, and gave the loaves of bread to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
All ate and were satisfied. Then they removed the remainder of the fractions. Twelve large baskets, filled to overflowing.
And those who were eating were about five thousand men, not counting the women and the children. The miracle of walking on water
And the time was critical, Jesus obligated his disciples to board the boat and outpace him to the other side, so that he might dissipate the crowd.
And after he had dispersed the crowds, he went up to the mountain alone to pray. And when the evening came, there he was alone.
As for the ship, it had become in the middle of the sea, suffering from the waves. For the wind was against it.
And at the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went up to them, crossing on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were alarmed, crying, "It is a fantasy!"
"Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Nor do I forgive anyone who offends me."
Peter replied, "Master, if you are the one, tell me to come to you on the water." (From the Holy Spirit's account in Matthew 14:22-33 and Mark 6:45-52)
He said, "Come." So Peter got down from the ship and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he was afraid. And when he began to sink, he cried out, "O Lord, save me!"
At that moment, Jesus stretched out his hand and grasped him, saying to him, "O little faith, why didst thou doubt?"
And when they entered the ship, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat came and fell down before him, saying, "Indeed, you are the Son of God!"."
When they crossed over, they came to the land of Cynesarth.
Men of that place recognized him. They sent for all the sick people in that district surrounding it, and brought them all to him.
And they asked him to touch the hem of his garment, nothing more. For all those who touched him received healing.
The Pure and The Impure
At that time, a certain man, John, the son of
Why do your pupils disregard the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
He answered and said to them, "And you also, why do you transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
God recommended, saying: Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses a father or a mother, let him die a death.
And as for you, you will say: Whoever says to his father or to his mother: An offering, that is which you take benefit, from me. Then he does not honor his father or his mother.
For you have rendered ineffective God's commandment through your tradition!
O hypocrites! Well, Isaiah prophesied about you, saying:
He approaches this people with his mouth, and honors me with his lips, but his heart is far from me.
And in vain they worship me, and they know the teachings, which are the commandments of the people.
Then he called the assembly and said to them, "Listen and understand."
What enters the mouth does not defile a person, but what comes out of the mouth defiles a person.
Then his disciples came forward and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees, when they heard this saying, were disgusted?"
He answered and said: "Every planting which my father, the 1 السماوية, did not plant, uproot it."
Leave them. They are blind leaders, blind. And if a blind leader falls, they both fall into a pit.
Peter then replied, "Go on, explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "Are you also still at this point not understanding?"
Do you not understand yet that everything that enters the mouth goes down to the stomach and is then pushed out to the exit?
As for what comes out of the mouth, it issues from the heart. And that corrupts the human being,
Because out of the heart come evil thoughts: murders, adultery, unchastity, theft, false testimony, blasphemy.
This is the one that contaminates the human. And as for eating with unwashed hands, it does not contaminate the human.' The faith of the woman of Kenaan.
Then Jesus went out from there and went to the areas of Tyre and Sidon.
And a woman of Canaan, coming forth from those frontiers, cried out to him, saying: "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, O son of David! My daughter is exceedingly mad."
Not answering her with a word, he advanced with his disciples and asked of him, saying: "Cast her out, for she howls after us!"
He answered and said, "I have only sent sheep to the house of Israel, the stray ones."
She came and prostrated herself before him, saying: "O master, help me!"
He answered and said, "It is not right that the bread of the children should be taken and given to the dogs."
Yes, sir! And the dogs also eat from the remnants that fall from a table whose owners are!
Then Jesus answered, saying to her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you even as you wish." And her daughter was healed that same hour. The feeding of the four thousand men.
Then Jesus moved from there and came to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and he sat there.
Many crowds came to him, carrying those who were lame, الأعمى, خرس, paralyzed, and others who were many. They threw them down at the feet of Jesus. He healed them.
Even the multitude was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the paralyzed walking, the lame leaping, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion for the crowd; for now they have three days to stay with Me, and they have nothing to eat. And I do not want to have them come fasting, lest they should wear out themselves on the way."
He said to his disciples, "From where, in the wilderness, will we be able to get bread in this amount, so that a crowd this large number can be satisfied?" الشرح: The translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original Arabic text. The phrasing and sentence structure in English are appropriately mirrored. Crucially, only the text of the translation is printed, and no explanations are provided.
He said to them, Jesus, "How much bread do you have?" They said,
He ordered the masses to lean on the ground.
He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish, gave thanks, broke it up, and gave to his disciples. And the disciples gave to the crowd.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they removed what remained of the fraction; seven baskets were filled.
And the ones who were eating were four thousand men, except for the women and the children.
Then he dispersed the multitude and ascended to the ship, coming to the borders of Gaza.
Request for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, seeking to test him. They asked him to show them a sign from the sky.
He answered them and said, "If it is evening, you will
And in the morning: The day is winter because the sky is reddened with a frown. O hypocrites! You know how to distinguish the face of the sky, but as for the signs of the times, you cannot!
A generation accursed, depraved, groveling for a sign, yet never shown a sign except the sign of Jonah the prophet. And then he left them and went away. The خمــير of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
And when his disciples came to the ʿImbr, they forgot to take bread.
And Jesus said to them, «Look, and watch yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.»
They thought to themselves, saying, "We did not take bread."
Jesus knew that they had been thinking about themselves, about their few beliefs, and how they hadn't taken bread.
Do you still not understand? And do you not remember the five loaves of bread, the five thousand, and how many baskets you took?
And not a loaf of bread, the four, the thousands, and how much did you take?
How do you not understand that I was not talking about bread? I told you to guard yourselves against the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees?
At that time they understood that he had not said to guard against the leaven of the bread, but rather against the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Recognition of Peter in Christ
And when Jesus came to the vicinity of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying: «Who does the people say, 'I am the son of God'?».
They said, "A people: John the Baptist, and others: Elijah, and others: Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them: "And you, who do you say that I am?"
He replied, "Simon, son of John, do you really know me?" Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God!"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of John; flesh and blood did not reveal to you, but the Father who is in the heavens."
And I also tell you this: You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome them.
And I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven; therefore, whatever you have bound on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you have loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah, Jesus. Jesus preaches his own death and resurrection.
From that time, Jesus began to appear to his disciples, showing them that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer much. This suffering would be from the elders, chief priests, scribes, and killers. This would occur on the third day.
Peter took it to him and began to rebuke it, saying, "It shall not be so, Lord! For it is not fitting for you!"
Then he turned and said to Peter, "Go away from me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me, because you do not care for what God has for the people, but you care only for yourselves."
Jesus then said to his disciples: "If anyone wants to come and follow me, they must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me."
He who would save his own hide will ruin it; and he who will destroy his own self for my sake will find it.
Because what advantage is there to a man if he gains the whole world but loses himself? Or what can a man give as a ransom for himself?
For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father with His own angels, and in His glory shall all men be brought before Him to be judged, with each according to his deeds.
Truly I say unto you: out of those who stand here, a company shall arise that shall not taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his glory.'
The manifestation
And six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and ascended with them to a high mountain, set apart from the rest.
And his appearance changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white like light.
And if Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking with him.
Peter then made this suggestion to Jesus, "Master, it is good that we be here. If you wish, we can put up here three awnings, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am very pleased. To him listen."
And when the disciples heard, they fell on their faces, greatly afraid.
Jesus came, touched them, and said, "Rise, and do not fear."
They raised their eyes and saw no one, but Jesus alone.
As they were going down from the mountain, Jesus gave them these instructions: "Do not tell anyone about what you have seen, until Jesus, the Son of God, is raised from the dead."
And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered them and said, "Elijah comes first and will turn back everything."
But I tell you: Elijah has come, and they did not know him, nor did they receive him to do His will. Likewise, the Son of Man will also suffer in this world.
At that time, the disciples understood that he had been speaking to them about John the Baptist, and about the healing of a young boy possessed by a demon.
And when they came to the assembly, a man advanced to him, prostrating himself before him.
And saying: "O master, have mercy on my son, for he suffers greatly, falling and suffering intensely, often falling into the fire and often into the water."
And I brought him to your disciples, but they were not able to heal him.'
Jesus answered and said, "O generation of naïveté, of mal bending, how long am I among you? How long do I endure you? Bring him here to me!"."
Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him. The boy was healed from that moment on.
Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, "Why could not we hinder Him?"
He said to them, "It is because of your unbelief. I tell you the truth, if you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you would have said to this mountain, 'Move from here to there, and it will move; otherwise, no thing will be impossible for you.' "
As for this race, it is only released through prayer and fasting.
And as they were hesitating in the valley of the dry ground, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be given into the hands of the people."
And they shall kill him, and at the third day he shall arise.' And they were grieved with great sorrow: the tax of the temple.
And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the two dirhams proceeded to Peter and said, "Is not your teacher to whom he pays the two dirhams?"
He replied, "Yes." When he entered the house, Jesus preceded him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From where do the kings of the earth take authority over the collection of taxes or the imposition of tribute? Are they from their own sons or from foreigners?"
He said to him, "Of the Gentiles." Jesus said to him, "If the sons are free."
But so that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a spear, and the fish that comes out first, take it. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stara; take it and give it to them from me and from you.
