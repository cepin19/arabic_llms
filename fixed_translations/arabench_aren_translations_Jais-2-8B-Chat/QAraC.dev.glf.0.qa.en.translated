I am saying the words that you do not want to understand, O Salah.
Any problems, Saleh, open your mouth, open your mind, open the world around you, open the people, what are you doing? Open the world, what are you doing?
If his brother is my uncle.
And he doesn't want to develop himself and develop those around him.
O Salih, don't let your opinion be the only one.
No, no, no, no. I am not to be blamed by you.
And she walks on the road.
And like this, you take two dates, cut them.
And you're dead, what's the use?
Eat or don't eat.
No, I will not eat.
Here are the human agreeing.
This guy, I don't know where you're living.
I wanted with him
This is our opportunity, by God, our old cars and their failed models...
Try yourself, try yourself with him after a while, and may he protect you.
These are ordinary and well-known matters.
The bull, but only the one without a personality.
Yes, by God, he is afraid.
I am the one who is making my mother's head explode.
The budget is under his control.
What is this project that he is handling?
The Big Government Project
Underneath it, and not showing.
I am entitled to take
You are in one ministry, and you are in another ministry.
What's wrong, mom? You forgot.
A day in the stable.
I mean, I am.
I consider myself a contributor to them.
Nothing happens, nothing appears for me from the project, oh my peace.
and it is not my concern
I mean, so my contribution is after all.
We are all supposed to take
This is a government project.
Biff started understanding this bull better.
I understand him.
May good fortune come to you, you will kick it away.
This is a government project.
Here is your chance.
Like your car, it won't go anywhere.
Chinese, good in front of you.
Take your bite and put it in your jaw.
Ariel, what was in his hiding place?
I myself heard it with my own ears.
They tell you, "It's known, the government projects."
And a third of it was suctioned.
His son Salom.
I am going to Souq Waqif.
One light: eighteen pence.
Allocate it in the budget.
And eighty one Arial, one hundred.
They said, "We didn't do anything."
You want to be with him.
Seek refuge in Satan.
Yes, but I feel that his head started to soften a little.
God willing, oh Lord.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text: Here is the chairman of the committee, and everything is under his control.
The most important thing, do not forget us.
We are your quarter.
And it means we have to be with each other.
and this government project is an opportunity
Sure, Ali.
And we cannot do without you.
You don't need to advise us, Ali.
God willing, all those who will be among the project's staff.
This is definitely something.
Yesterday me and the guys were sitting talking.
We are from your side.
The committee members are reassured.
Fearful of Saleh, the chairman of this committee.
They say that he is...
Good news, Ali.
And reassure the people.
Really, I swear, Abu Fahad.
May God bless you with goodness, but you didn't tell me.
then don't forget, oh sa'uwt
No no
God willing, things will go as well as can be hoped.
Let him agree to this, Saleh.
Don't worry.
I don't know if the rash is between me and the rash.
What does it mean?
That's it, since you are with us in the department, it means you are contributing with us on the project.
But the most important thing is that the matter remains between us.
Grill some Chinese fried rice and meat right in front of you.
I have to eat.
Here and with good health.
Is there something in you?
If you keep getting distracted like this.
We are never done.
We will never be free in this state.
Or any inquiry, they say.
Here we are, helping and collaborating.
How do we take our share?
How is it possible?
What do we write on it?
Then, you know, it's not just us who will take it.
Everyone who contributed to the project is demanding their right.
Why not
Without this fear, Salah.
We are the ones who set the budget.
And he cut the land that he bought today and registered in his name.
Find her after.
He tells you not to buy it.
Where are you from, saying such things?
Got in touch with me today
He tells me to call my brother's phone that's out of service.
I killed him for good.
Let your brother know as quickly.
You see the second Earth.
The one who took the land that I bought for him yesterday.
They agreed to sell it.
He says, "Call him and tell him, 'If you want it, I will register it in your name.'"
He wants to get married to her on his own.
and our right
And we consider ourselves his partners.
Even if we are not contributing.
A morsel, how big it is! You swallow it with your soul.
Holding back reduces your brother's and mother's rights with you.
I didn't come to compare myself to you.
We are also shareholders in the project, and as such, we have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her.
Here it is, truly yesterday, when Sultan came and asked him, and he refused.
But I didn't let him.
And you are wrong if you don't isolate a specific amount for the project.
المرحلة الأولى
You are no less than others.
The members of the committee who are with him.
Listen to him talking to them on the phone.
The entrance, their brothers and their people.
I know that this government project is a way.
We don't want a lump sum and to leave.
Money correspondence
If my brother Sultan wants to attend our meetings, he can.
Because the committee members
Project budget
This is all that is required.
You have done well.
May God protect you and grant you goodness.
Your brother-in-law
Do you like it, though?
He serves us with the project.
Let it be mentioned.
We distributed the tasks fairly.
You, Saleh.
And I am holding the planks, the bricks, and the timber.
The rest of the things, electricity and water, leave it to me.
Folks
Determine your share.
I swear, I am...
Hours I say to take a lump sum.
And sometimes I say
Keep it a ratio.
It's not a problem, Saleh, it's not a problem.
Taking what you want and the way you want it.
The most important thing
We are also after.
Will this week.
Each person determines the amount they are thinking of.
it means for example
After several days, he no longer felt like it.
He also wants his mother a thousand more.
Why man, what does it mean, ha?
What do you think, otherwise?
I am with you.
Even after the shareholders.
Bring your plunder, your work, what is owed to you.
You have a solution for orphaned children.
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or,
Wow, the food is really something.
What is this business?
What is this? This is an Abu Mal's drink, for you.
Which Sultan
O Sultan, O your brother.
That means he is still considered a contributor.
This is the last name.
This is your friend Saud, how many names did he put?
He increased, he increased, the names, saying, 'What benefit will they bring?'
Okay, I will place it in any relevant group: percentage or a fixed amount.
Don't put it with the trash.
Put how many you put for him, you put for him, I mean put for him twenty thousand.
Okay.
Even in a note here they wrote.
He is one of the boys from our neighborhood.
That's Saoud, his list increased beyond the list of Abdulaziz.
All of it will be put into the budget for the first phase.
The provided text appears
Here's the translation, based on the likely meaning
The one who calls every couple of hours, recruits people according to their own desires.
May God prolong her life, but this is just haha.
The eyes of my son.
And whoever hands it over to you, know that she is sick, poor, and a miserable being.
This time, she has nothing.
Oh God, guide you, I won't tell you, but this is the last one.
Tell him the farming pulled hard.
Here, I'll just take a moment, how much does it take?
How much is enough for me, for my living, my housing, my hospital?
One hundred eighty thousand Ariyal.
You are a very naughty person who likes to blackmail.
Only him, just your precious sister.
Oh God, guide you, put her name in the list.
Hassina oh oh Hassina daughter of Ahlaal
Behind, you give it to her from your pocket.
Reassure him and tell him that from the second phase, nothing is left.
EEMYA and eighty thousand
Oh, good boy, they will fit a new, fresh, small branch for her.
Tell him, tell him, let him give me more. After two thousand, I will buy gifts for the girls.
I will tell you a thousand.
The thousand Ariyal for me.
Which Husseiniyeh, daughter of Ahdal?
I can fail you in front of your friends.
No, oh my.
I have a lot of work.
Then I will call you later.
This is how they increased those who eat from the Chinese plate.
The infrastructure can withstand it.
Don't forget me then.
Write the number you want.
He returned, I don't know.
You and your conscience.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I was like, you deserve a million.
They will determine tomorrow, the project will begin.
And they are going down now, God willing, the payments for us, aaa, the first one.
We know a prophet.
Once, give us, or in installments.
What's the point of this? We have more.
In a lap, there is a suction. The important thing is to keep quiet. The committee, we are now waiting for them and they will come.
Yallah, he said yallah, he told you to be quiet, meaning, be quiet.
Really, how shameless and imaginative you are!
If you hear one of you.
To cut off his tongue.
Oh, they took a long time, those people.
Do you know this one too, with the money, not just like this?
Before it was like this.
Fifty million
What are you, a bowl of jelly?
In the end, you are the president.
We don't want headaches.
We approve the budget.
Through your talk about the project, Mr. Saleh, we notice that it is a vital and important project.
This, may God protect you, is not just about this generation.
Yes, Yes
I hate the opening of the first phase of the project.
I would like to thank you for your attendance and to congratulate you.
And I welcome
On this occasion,
The United Nations
Where are they taking us? Where are they taking us? The project.
Okay, here is t
I don't know where we are.
This is not a good situation.
You are not seen, the officials. They spoke, and people applauded them.
We are at the official opening, what's wrong?
Now you are talking, I mean we are in the project.
Yeah, we're in the project.
And the people, covered in sweat, were falling.
This box, I don't know what it is, they've put it in.
What's the point of working in the box?
This "sandbox" (or "playpen"), God bless you, protects the infrastructure.
The official opening of the world's beaches.
What are you doing for the third millennium?
I swear, I don't know what you did.
Thank God, age is just a number.
Jean, I know why they fired me.
Just let him park.
I was surprised by this, I.
Just when she told me
I didn't receive anything.
I saw her alone, and she was well-groomed, what could be bigger than that?
Thank God, you are comfortable.
The dude is chilling, and you're just chilling at home, feeling comfortable.
Why the harm, no, oh father, no, let no one play with their mind, oh sheikhha Munira.
Praise the Lord, O Manal, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
They are afraid for your share and invest it for you.
There is a joyful party, a share.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's share.
We don't know these stories.
This is a legitimate right.
This means this is an issue of trust. You don't trust us.
I don't know how.
I didn't like my brother Rashid's words.
He goes and comes back from this check they give me every three months.
Okay, this is mine.
It all tells me.
You don't trust us.
The stories of inheritance and money, there must be clarity in them.
As long as you are my father, you will not be comfortable.
You know what you do to people.
This is not a translation,
Who would believe that she is an heir to millions?
With her, her brothers.
Money destroys the world.
Justify what is just, and this is the law of God.
And then, I mean.
And we manage the company.
And we invest in lands, real estate, and money.
No problems, no headaches.
She says she was passing by the ground in the field.
It's too much for her.
to be able to describe her behind the story
Any story.
Your sister seemed to be snooping.
This is the story.
This one intends to make us some stories.
We give her money.
A falcon gave you a gift.
We need to find a solution, Rashid.
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance.
Those who give charity to me every three months.
Everything is known.
Forty thousand, it has not changed.
They wouldn't invest their money.
Emptiness, its emptiness, its emptiness, its emptiness.
What's the meaning now?
It doesn't need thinking.
They said we will increase it in order for her to be happy and to be quiet.
Revise all your words, revise.
They are sitting and giving it to me drop by drop.
If I were to assault their women.
And the aluminum sets in various shapes and colors.
And I am forbidden to live even half of their life.
Scorning me for my father's lawful sustenance.
You are obstructing.
This is your right.
Legally and fundamentally.
I feel that they are going to exploit me and deceive me.
I am not comfortable with their way. Enough.
I swear, oh mother, it's not known what will happen in this world.
They humiliated me, mistreated me, oh mother.
They don't know that there is an account and a punishment.
And God will reward them for eating the forbidden money.
And bear it, oh mother, you will show them the path of the courts.
They will really hatch.
From our abundance, meaning, or from the sheer number of our inhabitants.
For this reason, I tell you, oh mother.
This is a bit.
Everyone has a building that you would say are skyscrapers.
I only want my right.
My son, build a house before I die.
Here was my translation: And I wish to give charity to these poor people.
Okay, Mom, Um Salmin.
Keep Sidj in your stomach, oh mother.
And don't reveal to them the details of the court proceedings.
And no recompense is in vain.
Do you know why?
In this time.
She has her fill.
Hey, ask the accountant.
You are the one who asks the accountant.
Reply to them.
Yes, I, no, I, mean, God bless you, I mean, I, oh, I came here for my sister.
The door I entered from.
Do not be afraid.
The door that I rushed out of.
No, no
No, falcon.
Saad Haram
You're welcome, don't you dare ruin them.
It became clear your share in the company and real estate; we have no objection.
ستميه الف
She has always been quiet.
For sure, this is the type of person the louse likes.
And if not, your sister is kind.
I am sitting and listening to them.
A specific, known, and determined share.
You will either take six hundred thousand or else face sixty thousand dire consequences.
May it be a shame upon them.
My expectation is for anything, oh Manorah.
My father's company.
Eight buildings
Land and houses
Someone will sell for six hundred thousand.
And you expect a concession.
No, Manira.
* **تحمّلي ايقصونك عليج و اتوقعين تنازل تحمّلي هذاني قت
You have the right to know everything about your father, including all details about land and money, not according to their wishes.
Only the company.
You are a partner with them.
Now they are chasing you from the company.
I'll tell you, no one can stop me.
Find out what it is.
Abouk Company is
You're not seeing it, he's provoking.
I'm telling you, let me go in.
He didn't need to.
He has papers, I don't know what.
Oh my, let his tongue be long on us, let us shorten his tongue.
We are sorry.
My brother Saad and Falcon, with their income, I have the office. I explain to them, they don't know, what is this about?
Come on, come inside.
Look, brother Nasser is drinking.
May God bless you.
What have you changed?
They made up a story about us.
It discovers they came to it.
He discovers that she has four hundred thousand vaginas, forty.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Let's calculate it with me.
Ninety-six months
This story, I multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million, five hundred twenty thousand.
Okay, good, bird, I mean.
He hit his head on the float.
Thank him by telling him.
These are our money.
All young men are this shape which they inherited.
Greetings to those who have brought us forgiveness, forgiveness, the company, your company, nothing but good happened.
We are prohibited.
This accountant Samir is present.
He buys anything that brother Nasser wants, and he checks on it.
All company is at your command.
You want to go in? Go in and take your comfort. Mall, mall. Don't ask about anything.
May you be free of defects.
Don't worry.
Get his/her attention.
Search for all files within it.
It is supposed to have more than ten million.
He does not urinate while being noticed.
You say, "Poor thing."
Her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they had three territories.
And every land is larger than the other.
We put God in front and the best protector after Him, upon them, oh father.
This is a violation/transgression upon them, for those who are sitting and doing it.
I do not intimidate them.
And I, what can I do, O سلمان?
I have no choice but to sue them in court.
This appears to be
The case has been postponed.
Be strong, oh father, oh Nasser.
They brought the matter of the court to their attention.
Oh my, you left your bed and the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O you who are safe/sound.
Go, go, put yourself in a stone.
What is the cure for the diseases of the Muslims?
What did he say to me?
Excuse me.
Oh, I remembered you, I knew you, I knew you.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Regarding what, brother?
Don't worry, you're welcome.
He is slaughtering a sheep, a day after knowing about millions.
He said, "I hope," God willing, "that this Abdullah who I sent to them..."
I mean, here is Rashed's friend, straight.
He knows him properly from many years.
Do you honestly believe Manira?
Even Abdullah, this is the advice he gave me.
Stay behind them.
Any of you, I will not let you give them gifts.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah tells me?
Not like people who live seventy or eighty years.
Our courts are for people who live barely, for at least two hundred years.
May Allah have mercy on her.
She, God have mercy on her, used to say...
Our population has not yet reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years and more.
They must confine us in order for us to review the courts.
This is it
Here, you are with them.
May God grant you success, God willing.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text: **"It's an old friend from the days of school."**
This world is not worth it.
And I am here with you, in goodness.
And you, God bless you, from a well-known and large family.
And children of good stock.
Ava, oh Rashid, we are friends.
Do it out of kindness.
And you either speak now or you will be silent.
Oh God, oh God, no this nonsense, a quarter of a quarter.
Do you do it, or how are you now?
It's a one-hundred-ninety thousand yuan jewelry exhibit.
Where did she come from?
They spend money on their women.
And depriving their sister of her rightful share.
Do you still have hope, Nasser?
You and them are fighting with you.
Yesterday when I spoke to him at the masjid.
Leave me as I told you.
Rare, known Arab boys.
Why not?
That's all from me.
Your current session, may Allah make it blessed, with these radiant faces.
O Allah, illuminate our hearts to that which is good for our religion and our worldly life.
Listen, you.
Do you have another topic other than the topic of my sister's inheritance?
He is blameworthy/reprehensible.
Go, don't get upset.
I am not to be blamed for you.
And I have been begging you for months, pleading with you, while you are stubbornly insisting on your course.
I won't, I'm not worried about you.
Tomorrow morning I am going to the court.
Empty, empty.
هلا هلا
It's not your concern.
You will not go to court tomorrow.
The following text was
In order to give you a chance to see what you will do.
Goodbye
It is only with the red eye.
And if you hear them suffering.
Let's see what they decide.
Tomorrow, you will tell me you are busy.
The rapporteur is going to complain about us in court.
We will kill her, just wait until tomorrow and we will go to her.
This is what?
May God grant you soundness of tongue.
You told me what is right/truth.
It seems you are going to court to complain about us.
To inherit your share of the inheritance.
She said.
Your world became sweeter.
Your world excelled.
Why did I tell you later, the day after?
The first thing when you go is to reach the courthouse building. You should park your car in the parking lot.
They found a security and safety device.
Will you go to the eighth floor?
This role has judges in it.
Lawyers' cards in the town.
Certainly, you need them.
Come and joke with us here.
We want her to complain about us in court.
My soul shall go to the court.
My hearing is enlightened.
And you expect us to make a concession.
It had in it / It contained.
Delineating the path.
Delineating the path.
We walk, my brother.
I forgot to give my sister Manal something important.
This is Al-Raya newspaper, today's edition.
Here is the
It seems like a
Abij Agovine, a gift from...
Let him come out of the state that he is living in.
Cursing, I swear to God.
Four children, one has a house like normal people, he doesn't have
He cannot be blamed, he put those around him and those around him.
Poor adventurous soul in this project.
What I would have never expected to be a business is Bo Walid.
They ate, they ate the children of the merchant, the new one, Abu Walid.
My heart's love, shall I put something for you?
Just like that.
Okay, here is the translation, without any added explanations: "Alright, you get up, get up and move, take some fruits for you."
Yum, I want the game that's with Hamoud.
May you be well and in good health. May you be well and in good health.
Mama Walid, get up and put sweet for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Mr. Abu Walid, you deserve it, congratulations.
Managed by me for a quarter, an excellent accountant.
May you be safe, safe, father.
Dad, since we've become big traders, I want you to build me a private room.
Joe Schطالب has no ambition, his capital is not productive.
God willing, I will bring you a Blackberry from the big ones.
Let's leave your requests alone.
Our situation is like that of ordinary people.
Instead of this floating condo they live in.
First, let's pay off the debts we have, and then good things will happen.
Oh my, it's clear you're very happy, Abu Waleed.
He started eating more than before.
A dealer who is equal to his size.
My father, the merchant, lives.
Blessings of the project.
Let the share of the partners be taken.
Your Lord is He who
I met a Japanese one of them.
Here are a few accurate translations of
Dry one of the quarter.
Let no one say it's an opportunity.
Multi-purpose halls
This is always like this.
Computer rooms these.
Knock it off the cinema.
Suddenly a sports stadium, wow!
This is magic.
They were immediately impressed and agreed.
Here's the translation of your text into English: **"Formerly, the amount from the bank was a bit, and the amount from my wife's family was a bit, and the amount from me was a bit, and I sold a piece of land I had, thank God."**
You are the madam of the committee that has approved.
Jan requested the order from the factory since the ministry approved it.
And along the factory, the email.
I am sorry, but
There is za'atar.
There is nothing, I swear, I am sitting in an office waiting.
The secretary didn't call me, dude.
And ten, he is traveling.
It's up to you and your luck.
Okay, now my transaction is completely processed.
And the committee has approved it.
Why are you, I mean, not what I expect on it, I mean, what happens?
You are a complete manager.
Why don't you go there and he will sign for you and we will be done.
He had no power in his hands.
Not all employees are like this.
Everyone is a mercenary in their own way, that's how you're saying it, oh Naj, come with a boat.
Thank your Lord.
I swear, dude, I was reviewing them while also being worried.
God willing, it's finished.
And this is Bu Fahad, his whereabouts are unknown. When will he start working? When will he *not* work? It's up to him.
What should I do, brother?
And afterwards, he returned and the money became his.
He has to go quickly to finish the transaction, I really don't know what to do.
I'm really worried that the manager will ask about you.
His word is sick, his word is anything.
Even I am waiting for Abu Fahad.
Okay, if you are the secretary and you say this, it means what solution?
And give me your number.
The secretary, no, they sat down, they sat down. The secretary, what's wrong with you?
Do not call, you startled the group, they were scared, they thought the secretary had left.
Now we are sitting waiting for Abu Fahad.
My father, plus my wealth, I am the one who kneels, I prayed.
This one is free. This one is also free.
Hold on, hold on, everyone.
Calm, calm, Ashous, calm.
Okay, he told you to be quiet, but just get (it/something).
Boojahd now had to go to the airport.
How did he get out?
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's get to him by the car, let's go.
This is a difficult problem.
May God help you.
Look at Bu Fahd.
I don't blame your father, my love.
But he is very unnatural.
And if he does not receive the goods.
He will lose his money.
But now I need it.
Here's where he is now.
What's wrong, what are you looking for?
There is in front of you.
Oh, you're calling me at night, waking me up from sleep?
Dude, I told you.
I told you so.
Tell me, O my grandfather.
Dad, I know but it can't happen.
Class starts next week at university.
And if I don't register with them or they don't accept me, it means I have to wait for the next course.
Grandfather, it's been three months, it's a shame to lose it.
It means, oh my God, forgive me, I am at fault.
Here I am, every day I return them, every day I return them.
They waited, they waited.
And I am sitting at home.
You don't understand.
Do not call except around lunch time.
This is the fourth time you have called me.
Man, you don't get it, do you?
I know you need the money.
Hopefully, he will be able to sign the transaction this week.
They will pay him the first payment.
By God, I don't know what to say to you, my sister.
He woke up abruptly.
And during the night, he walks and talks to himself.
And if he does not fall, Bofhad.
God save us.
For this reason
This week, Bufahad will sign the transaction.
Abu Fahad, what is taking so long for him to sign the transaction?
Bo Fahad will be working today.
And he will travel for a year.
And leaving the interests of the people.
How? How? How? How?
better now
It divided me in two.
It's pulling me, it's turning me, this amazing heat.
What else is there?
Heard that I am going to review.
For my transaction
Here are a few possible
The deadline is approaching, I'm finishing.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Ma'ak sikkeri Bo Fahad
And I wanted to tell you.
Tomorrow, Bofهد, God willing, he will definitely start working.
As soon as it reaches you.
Come to me immediately.
Accompanying the
Oh man, you've never looked this way.
Here I present a riddle to you.
And you're looking at my phone.
I said it's a shame.
At least to feel.
And if it becomes moderate.
I return you to your section.
Fifteen cartons of printed materials.
And fifteen cartons of paper for printing.
You really broke my heart, I swear.
The boss was punished.
Oh, here he comes, and here I am.
Did you know about the factory?
He will lose a large amount if he doesn't finalize his transaction today and they don't sign it for him.
If he goes and the manager knows.
Hello there, human.
And if the manager asks about him/it?
Don't be afraid, we are acting, just let him go, by God, it is a shame.
Good man, Abu Waleed.
I go, but I just wait for a call, God willing, and
Here a
May God help him.
Hold on, everyone, hold on, everyone, hold on.
What do I know? Maybe someone from the office came by, took some things, and left.
Look at Buffhad.
Until something moves.
Do not sit.
Wait, Abu Fahad.
Until then.
Look at Abu Fahd.
Look at Buffhad.
Wait, Bufahd.
Let's go and search in the Republic of Uzbekistan.
Turn turn
Down, down.
We are crawling on you here and millions.
Call the hospital quickly.
They are not speaking at the hospital.
Look at Bu Fahd.
I spent all my life as a correspondent from those years until today.
By God, Omar, oh Abu Sa'id.
How then?
He can spend the next forty years.
I am a reporter.
Dukha yabuk
It started raining after the air conditioning was turned on in those years.
And you think the cycle was easy those days?
There is a yellow stamp.
By God, you've tired, Bou Said.
Work hard, father.
But what are you doing, oh human?
Abu Said
Oh God, forgive us. The manager has arrived, and we will go to finish our matters, according to his saying.
The manager has arrived, oh how sweet, let's go!
Congratulations Boussid
They say your son Khalid has found work.
How am I to you?
I didn't tell you, God willing.
Pigeon droppings
I didn't tell you, God willing, for the one who graduates last among my children, I will finish.
He graduated and started working.
Praise be to God, here I am now. I am going to finish my affairs.
She delivered the message to perfection.
Praise be to God, we did not fall short, praise be to God.
Change, exchange, oh Abu Said.
And you deserve it.
You did not fall short, by God, O Abu Abdul Aziz.
You did not fall short, by God, O Abu Abdul Aziz.
She is she
We did what we had to do.
Baji, they will also complete the march.
The provided
After all these years and tiredness.
It means it's all about conditions, in conditions.
You must rest, Abu Said.
After leaving you here, the madam has invited me.
In connection with the retirement.
And he led him to coffee and dates, oh peace.
He returned, finished with me, oh father.
You seem in a hurry for the kunafa, Abu Said.
Never mind.
The khanfresh is ready.
Yay yay, God willing, from my eyes, with goodbye.
The khanfresh is ready for me, waiting for me, woe is me.
I will now finish all the papers for you, God willing.
Your chance to take it today.
They told me their manager is traveling.
and I have no energy/patience
Even I have no urge to move.
Don't text anyone.
That's how you are officially considered free.
May God bless you.
Now he's finally freed up to relax.
You have been very helpful, Abu Abdul Aziz. Go in peace.
Bless me, my father.
There is no work.
So you're not involved, right?
Make it easier, father, for my sake.
Which human resources
Thank you, thank you, with peace.
Aki زهرou is hosting a party to celebrate the success of her son.
Here comes a cake.
Oh my, I can't.
I myself have a transaction to send. My father will take care of it for me.
The flower will be sad.
Okay, here is the translation: Kid, that's it, mom.
My father stopped the work.
May God be with him, he is alone now.
Here it worked a lot, let it rest, that's it.
Let him rest.
He told me to make him khunafresh.
I did it, and I prepared it.
I fell, waiting.
Fear Allah in this old age, have mercy on him, have mercy on his age.
Now it's your turn.
Tomorrow he will eat it.
He wants to rest, poor thing.
You spoiled him, this old man.
This is the Ahoh from its return.
Wahool is tired.
I do not command them in their command.
I do not rebel against them, I obey them.
I was planning to take the transaction to the bank, and while I was on my way to work.
And whoever threatens, if someone is late, woe to them!
Oh, my dear.
Here's the
Here upon this face and from these small eyes, this is the Chinese, oh God, with peace.
Good morning.
This is Ahwa, every day I'm ignoring you, your place.
Good, well, oh happy one!
It's a shame, oh his smell.
In my nose.
Khunfresh, Khunfar.
Your main drive
No, dad, I'm in the branch that's next to the market.
His spirit is there.
I will no longer go to the branch that is in the market, after they tell me I am not there and I am not certain.
God willing, God, with peace.
I can get a sunburn.
The sun shines.
I entered our neighbors' house.
The servant recognized me.
She told me what's wrong with you.
May God guide you and grant you patience.
Pull it, I can't pull it, a chinstrap, oh Said.
Yيمه abuway wainhu alheen
From the loo.
This is also after telling him which bank.
They told him the papers are missing.
Tell him to take a taxi.
Oh my, we had a meeting with the manager.
The important thing right now is how my father is. God willing, he will be fine.
My head ached a little, so I took some painkillers.
Here I am telling you, in front of him.
Let your father rest.
Poor are you, O Saeed.
They must adhere to duty hours after these reports are written. They need to know what they are supposed to do, and they must be held accountable.
How are you?
Hey, Abu Shaheen.
You can say I retired, and I didn't.
How does it mean?
The first of those years.
It is written upon us to toil.
Your children are real men.
We are obligated to help them.
and poor people who tell me
By God, you have no story.
I mean, now, the guys who don't have dads, they never finish their transactions.
A job is different from a position.
In a job that allows, meaning permits, you to exit.
May Allah reward you with good.
No, I'm not bothering you. I just want the coffee that's behind you.
Where are you, Abu Said?
I will go to finish the transaction for my son Said.
In this ministry, the one here by the cafe.
I will take it, I will take it to the lands, after God, may He help us.
Goodbye
Yum, what's wrong? Okay, I will see you later.
It's not better for you.
Here I warned you.
Because I, I heard you, you were saying something about Sa'id.
Your father is sick.
I am not at all like you.
Your father, if he doesn't complain to you.
He does not speak, he is silent.
And it does not speak.
You scolded him, you made him needy, fear God in this ريال.
You woke me up with your screaming, and it reached me over there, what's happening?
Dad, you were an employee in the government, and you know and understand what a stock-take means.
And they will write this first.
Now it's really true, now this, really they do.
Dad, tomorrow is the last day for processing transactions at the Development Bank for agricultural loans.
No one would say that.
Enough, father.
He related two words to you and you believed him.
He says he has a committee for inventory.
What's wrong?
Oh, how are you?
Go run and finish his transaction.
There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
He returned from being away, and here he is, silent.
I speak to him, he does not respond to me.
He has no life, and no shame.
Your father wouldn't blame you if he took a stance against you.
If that's what you're satisfied with.
May God reward you with the best reward. You did not fall short.
He was supposed to call you.
Why would he call his bedmaker?
Dear and precious, oh father.
And throughout your life, you have never been remiss with us.
Wipe me.
Leave it to me.
And that's it, father.
The honored and cherished one.
Khunfresh, Khunfresh.
Thank you very much.
Your satisfaction, my father.
May God reward you with good.
We decided, starting from today.
That we finish our transactions ourselves.
You have done well, father. May God reward you with goodness. Praise be to God.
Just what would make you safe, father?
Consider it the final one.
But I couldn't, it had to happen.
Call me now.
I am not going to the minister, Dad, I'm not going to him.
The minister will be upset with you.
You upset him, you have to go. After kissing him, you go. No, no, no, that's not allowed. This is everything, except the minister.
I won't go, Dad, meaning I don't know
No, I won't say it and you won't say it.
Your transaction is with me, consider it fully processed and ready.
Here you go on your way as you're heading to finish a transaction, Sa'id, my brother.
And whoever hands you over, oh father.
Consider it the last transaction you will complete for me.
Whatever you command, my father.
But your son had to sign this paper.
It means: "I will take it, bring it tomorrow."
To be honest, I advise you to get it today.
And if the transaction is not processed for them.
You will be waiting for a while, approximately two months.
Lalala, this time I will make him sign it, and I will return it.
No, it doesn't need it.
Call him, but just let him be for two minutes.
And I will dedicate it to you.
You don't know Said.
No need to take a vacation.
And I only want Morocco.
By God and all the young men, they are all with him.
Where are you, from asking one?
Tell me, am I with Said?
Yes, I am waiting for my work shift to end.
That's enough, father.
Finally, you got your papers sorted out yourself.
I beat my children.
You don't have children, do you?
I felt something, Uncle.
Here you go, Uncle.
You have done well.
There is no use.
I will leave you.
And go to the home for the elderly.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you telling them, Abu Sa'id?
I will write them something else.
Thank God.
Yesterday, he got out of prison.
I swear to God, my sister.
We got rid of those stories.
I will kill you if you, or I, ever speak on the radio or on television.
I didn't mean it to ruin things, it's just a mess.
May God guide, grant him solace, and grant him wellbeing, God willing.
Yalla, my sister. With safety, God protects you.
Here he went to prison.
I was traveling yesterday.
My brother, what can I tell you?
Contacted once on the program, this is for Al Miles, which they call it.
And I, my brothers, will speak to the man.
who is Khaled Jassem
He just says nonsense.
He went back, my sister, listen to them, his friends at work.
My sister was talking about the government.
Where is the oil money going?
I don't know, I don't know what happened to this boy.
Not one of his quarters.
Those who used to be pleased with him and would tell him "Do this" and "Do this".
They all disassociated themselves from him.
He is God, guide him.
Here's the translation of the text, without any added explanations: "And I just, my brothers, excuse me, I'm going and a cook will follow me."
May God bless you.
Come, father.
Come sit down.
Stop the nonsense, my son.
I swear, father, I am tired and sick.
This is her, lying in the hospital.
You don't deserve it, I swear, Mom.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you that happened to someone else.
Dad, I didn't tell you.
What, Mom?
And he started shouting.
I will not leave you.
Oh father, this time it passed.
Here I am, telling you.
Oh, my dear.
Forget the topic.
Enough nonsense.
Okay, why is the director fired, the poor thing?
It means after all these years, you come today and tell me "we've fired you".
Do you understand what is being said, Saleh?
Enough with the nonsense.
Give us just one.
Order, Saleh.
And you are a human being, for whom these matters do not pass.
You are, by God's grace, a diligent follower of public affairs, and you offer criticism.
Not easy.
It just means we finished with a score of one.
And you are one of them.
Are you not the intended one?
Okay, goodbye.
Saleh brother
Hopefully, your uncle Abu Munira doesn't find out.
I'll go, oh father, it's a bad omen for you.
Where would he know?
If I ask you...
Tell him to get a job.
If it wasn't for him, I would have killed you.
I asked his mother and she said that his father works.
Which is necessary.
His mother must be going in.
This is what we do with it now.
We involved our daughter with him.
Those you are ordering around.
I will give him a two-week deadline.
But if it doesn't work, I swear I will take it and with my own hands, I will bring it to the court and I will tell the judge, "Yes, I will divorce him."
Have you had coffee now, you?
You don't act like a fly except in your head.
يمه صراحه
Let me go!
It doesn't show up.
I know you want to leave.
Your heart aches for the coffee.
Do you want me to talk and ramble?
Go away, I'm sick of you, and go to sleep.
Tomorrow morning, go find a job.
God willing, I will get up early, meaning in the morning.
Yum, I told you to stop, I swear I've given up on this habit.
That's it, by God.
Yima, saraha, hasses bi muadayeq, shwaya shwaya.
Don't mention the name of our ruin, it's just nonsense.
Shut up
Not just us, the ruins of the past.
Where are you, uncle? You seem to be on silent mode. Don't you give us one of the old ones, uncle?
We heard, we heard, but it's nonsense, we heard.
Enough with the nonsense.
Enough nonsense.
Saleh is present.
Saleh is lying down.
So my son has done something wrong without me knowing.
We're just saying that our eyelid is intact and present in the cafe.
He said to you.
Hey mom, fix this thing.
Because there were people present.
You are just Nadia.
Don't waste your time with me.
If one dries out, someone at the door will kick their legs, filling them up.
But the blame isn't on you.
The shame is on him who did not stop you at your limit.
My son and the bread of my hands, I know you well, well or not.
You are like someone who is used to smoking.
Do you speak or do you not speak? Should I say or should I not say? I will just say, enough of this nonsense, or I will not say, enough of this nonsense.
Here I am, telling you.
Selling over the airwaves.
Otherwise, Saleh will just destroy us with nonsense.
Mr. Saleh, you are a man with a very high sense of national duty.
We cannot occupy you.
But what can we do?
Yalla, that's enough, forgive us.
Hello Saleh, what's your news?
Jan, don't tire yourself out. You are dear to us.
No, by God.
My brother, I wait for you every day, you just say it, that's enough nonsense.
Oh man, you are a brave human, not afraid.
And whoever hands you over once, tell them.
I am God, bless you, that's it.
What's the use of a cigarette? Just say
Oh really, the Real has fallen, he's begging you, just one, just for him.
Awesome, dude.
The important thing now, may your age be long.
For the position
The job is reversed. You deserve it. You are a patriotic and dear human being.
We were calling you to inform you.
He is very malicious towards you before God's creation.
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no available positions.
Poor souls, they wish to occupy me, but there are no jobs.
And now, how do you manage the household expenses, you and your mother?
And don't forget after.
Four children with them.
God is generous.
Never give up, my love.
Hold hope.
And I don't stop.
I have to go and look for a job for you.
Because my father doesn't make us have problems.
I am for you, I swear, oh Manal, I am ready to work anything.
And his repentance after, I just say it's nonsense.
But nonsense.
You know what he's been doing lately?
I told you so.
Just you, God, guide you, Abu Fahd.
Don't listen to the talk.
I myself will go and tell the minister about the troubles he is causing.
What does the minister think?
Definitely, he understands it like this.
You are right.
But this is something.
What cannot be ignored.
You know the rumor that they are going to replace you and that it is very strong indeed.
I am looking for a way to get rid of it.
I don't want anyone to feel that I am a party to the matter.
Your idea is correct.
What are you thinking about?
The way the Sultan is removing his path from yours.
You've heard of Saleh, Saleh is just nonsense.
May God keep you, this is from our village.
We will get revenge on him.
Do you remember our dear sister, Salah, by her voice?
No, Saleh.
And I am one of your biggest followers.
Nooh Salah, mashallah, after he no longer needs it.
God willing, very soon.
He returns, you hear his voice, you enjoy it.
Bofhad, on his own, asks about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you stop?
I mean, it's just a little bit of problems, psychological problems, and health issues.
Just want to be honest.
You are considered a fighter.
Long time, we haven't heard it.
God, God, God, I beseech You, O Salih, to return.
Only once, just for my sake.
My father, let me hear you say it.
Saleh will tell you it's done.
No, seriously, it's really, really, really difficult, to be frank.
What's wrong with you?
The Real wants you.
Abdulrahman, I am cutting.
Then you didn't tell me that you are looking for a job.
This is your chance.
Let the Real hear you and be pleased with you. The next day, go to his office and ask for the job.
A hollow, if you open it.
I just want to help you.
Do you know how
That's it, we don't want anyone, go to your home.
No, we don't want it.
Okay then, brother, listen up, wait, brother, let's understand.
That's it, we don't want anymore.
Okay, here is
Okay, now if I were to, let's say, return as I was at the last time, of course I would have cut off, meaning, but at the last time.
For example, what does he like? Like, "Whoo-whoo!" or "Boo!" or "Pfft!" Does he like to hear that?
What would make someone feel at ease, meaning recognize a lot of problems and a lot of troubles, and a lot of things that exist, exist a lot.
What is the thing that he prefers to hear, I mean, or he likes, for example, protests, I don't know, say you.
According to the contract concluded.
By virtue of his responsibilities.
Then eighty-seven semitometers, semitometers.
The work is ruined, basically.
Until someone interrupts me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh, the seventh?
Let someone interrupt me.
Seventh, Your Excellency the Minister.
Why is the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
Bring his brother's cars.
Hey everyone, stop with the nonsense.
And since you've come back to us with your voice, we don't want you to cut us off.
Any people who console me, I mean, last time.
And honestly, I've had enough.
"Yah, didn't you say it's finally stopped?"
And it was you who prevented it.
Oh, my daughter.
This is what they call basna, it's just nonsense, I'll expose him on the radio.
I haven't heard, but they told me.
I doubt that there is someone in the ministry who is leaking information to him.
He was a harsh person with a bad mood.
The atmosphere was bad for him.
The bearer of this message is the Wazir.
I don't care.
All my time is dedicated to the ministry, may God keep you.
I heard him, may your age be long.
Oh, I swear I said it just for you.
He didn't pay me any attention, dude.
He didn't talk to me.
Abdurahman Aykuli, go and do what you are occupied with.
He didn't talk to me.
By God, you are poor, O Salah.
Really, you broke my heart.
I am secretary of Bofhad.
And he knows the whole story.
The group exploited you. They had a specific target in mind.
And unfortunately, they reached him.
And you know who is behind this story?
Abdurahman, son of Faraj, is yours.
Here is the one who planned all of this.
This is an impossible task for you.
One day I would do with him the same thing that happened with Sultan.
The famous one, madam.
Impossible, who is occupying you?
Would you go to court so I can be released?
I found the solution.
We are currently the best society in the world.
Flawless
We do not have
We have no flaws at all.
We are comfortable.
What is the wasta?
Even if someone who knows you tells you to take the role.
Because it's the system.
He takes his rights more than the stranger.
We do not rely on the stranger.
We do not have
Your effort, your work, we have no flaws, we have flaws.
And an elder one.
He will go and make you stay at home.
There's nothing like that here.
And my regards.
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Famous for Salih, our ruin is surely rubbish.
I don't want dinner.
I was running around then a guy ripped my shirt and it split.
He saw you, new and just wearing it, he respected you.
He saw a boy wearing the new white shirt that we just bought, you and I, from the Village.
This is a translation of a sentence
This is good, they don't argue.
And I am placing this on my conscience.
When you, O fair judge, saw a boy as handsome as he, you awaited from him.
Not according to his whim.
Why are you ironing Walid's t-shirt?
He wore only a new t-shirt. His shirt was torn. I tore your shirt, I waited for you to say something to your father so he could buy you a shirt.
How are you?
Why did you tear Walid's shirt?
I will tell you.
Don't let me, I'll carry you, paste you, in the roundabout.
I say, my brother Sultan.
Why haven't you beaten him badly, like a black eye, giving him a punch in the face?
This is a young child, someone not your size.
This is a child, this is a child.
Hey people
Otherwise, the people will bring forth equitable and just individuals who will nurture and educate them.
They won't let him.
The price of your words, O Sultan, and of the nonsense.
Take me to school, little one. I am little.
You've always been arrogant.
Raise your children justly.
And if you are not capable of raising children and are not fit,
I am now respecting myself.
I wouldn't want to insult him or humiliate him in front of his wife.
Brothers, how great you are!
By God, if you enter and hit, and the boy does it a second time, or you do something to him.
Let no one blame but himself.
I am wasting my time with you.
Respect yourself, man.
Let's go to it, it scared me.
I won't pay attention to them.
Oh, where are you, oh time of the first?
And pure intentions.
Oh God, grant us forgiveness and good health.
My brother can't find more than this with you.
This is the biggest deal.
Hand over everything you have and come quickly.
The hollow of the calamity that befell upon our heads
Yes, but my father, you tell me exactly what is happening.
I forgive you, brother Ahmed. There's something going on at his place, and I need to go.
Trousers, a man, have left.
This is the act of a hateful person, whose heart is sick and filled with hatred and malice.
This, this is the act of Sultanu.
Hey man, where can he cut all these clothes?
My new clothes, I haven't enjoyed them or worn them. God is their judge.
I have to show him.
Sit down, I'm telling you.
If you go at the right time, he will deny it, saying "Oh, people" and similar things.
What's the opinion?
You are my baby boy, do you know how to walk a bicycle?
I know.
Waleed my darling
I say
Just tell me.
Where did mom put the scissors?
Under the bed.
May God destroy their lives.
But the corridors contain it.
I'm not quiet about it.
This is a crazy person who is not sober.
The most important thing right now.
And I will not change it.
But the story of this computer, it's a proof that I'm in it.
The drug is not available.
So our son can be a witness, if the baby breaks the computer that doesn't belong to us, and we don't know.
My soul, call him, call him, let us make the situation, is he or not?
Mind your own business, oh cheetahs.
Go, go find your quarter, go. Laugh at others instead.
I'll tell you, kid.
Go laugh at someone else, oh Fohod.
Crickets
Time of the tranquil hearts.
And pure intentions.
There are people.
It's not me who goes and looks for his friends.
Laugh at others, oh their ruler.
To falsely and slanderously accuse me.
Take the scissors.
Respect yourself, you.
Hey, Abdul Rahman, come quickly to me, my father.
The fault is with your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
Oh father, every day this is your state, you keep fighting.
I do not know.
A session like this
She is supposed to sit down.
In order to examine our work.
And the works of those who came before us.
And what we will become.
Let the lessons be taken.
And we learn.
This is not a reconciliation session, treat them like children.
As large as a camel.
You have children.
He doesn't understand anything.
His role model is his father; no, my father, for you.
His role model is his father.
O Sultan, you!
And you, Fahad.
And I am your eldest brother.
For my sake
By paying for the computer.
Okay now when you extended your hand to him
This is not an expression meaning "you reconciled."
No, that's just it, I didn't extend my hand to break free from it.
Get rid of the noise of this عبدالرحمن, after whom even those who talk don't remain silent.
Okay, where are you going?
By God, I will not let him go.
You did it yesterday, the next one.
Come out, don't hide.
If you are a real man, close the door. I tell you, close the door.
You didn't say that Abdul Rahman reconciled you with each other.
But, I swear, if it's not a big deal, I'll just enter his room and break things.
This brother of mine.
Unnatural.
Your brother is not normal.
Now I'll show you what's in it, take what you want.
Fahad, on his head, on his head.
Shut up, just shut up, kids. I'm sitting here, pretending, not being ashamed on my face.
We are like little kids, but oh father, that's all.
I swear to God, I will show you, I will show you, I swear to God, I will show you.
May it be torn, torn, oh mother, torn, what a big thing!
May his blood be upon me.
My heart wandered with this cry.
Oh God
Let's stay as we are.
By God, it's a shame.
This, while I am gathering you and serving your interests.
I will not show them mercy.
The day will come when, in the night, he will reconcile them.
What, mother, did he have time?
The provided input,
God bless him.
A fluent speaker.
But oh my mother
May God guide you.
You are supposed to calm yourselves down.
The firewood is not there, oh mother, the fire is burning.
Oh, it's good, God, I'm becoming better.
Ava upon you, O Abdulrahman.
I wanted you as an assistant, but you became a pharaoh.
You, my father, are the sane one. May God guide you.
Two behind each other.
Unfurl, unfurl.
You have disgraced us, may God guide you.
There is our neighbor, Saad. He looks at you and laughs at us.
Officer, he wants us, he wants us, and we tell him.
You don't have to deal with him, the officer banned him.
They are the ones who deleted all three of them.
لو سمحت
Brother, don't you come to me, and you also, don't you come to me?
The officer banned him, I swear I understand them from above.
I heard the officer banned him.
From above, meaning distant.
My brother was right about him.
Please, you have just agreed that your children will not take them again.
Thank you, thank you.
Greetings, my brother. Greetings, sir. Please, have a seat.
The officer banned him, how can you let them walk? Believe me, I am sure.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to tell you this in front of them.
This is عبدالرحمن, their old brother.
Ministerial Deputy Assistant Secretary
And the second is their middle brother, a director of a body.
Go take two tablets of paracetamol and rest.
The officer blocked him, "What's your excuse?"
You have two packets of Panadol here.
Oh my, God, sufficient for me against the enemy.
Allah is sufficient for me against the enemy.
Allah is sufficient for me against the enemy. They played a game on me.
Oh my, oh my, oh my, what are these stories, what, oh my.
Hey, what, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, got it.
This is an old man's hand, like his father's. There's someone who often makes flat pastries. He often deletes, yes.
Do you really believe it?
It's clear he's a well-born, respectable, and polite person.
And he says, "This is the daughter of the poor."
Even if
Now he will catch you.
Or else, his eyes won't descend from you.
And a naked one upon you.
Or all this, and until the opportunity comes.
What does it matter how many times you passed by, if when you turned around to look at me, you didn't see me?
Sodfa yaani
You both turn around at the same time.
No, but surely there's something.
I notice when I'm around you.
I feel that she is happy from the inside, there is joy and happiness in her.
Dude, go tell her, "Give me a pen."
Take my notebook.
Do you honestly not even know her name?
Romantic, excessively so.
You know, you are now in the 21st century.
By God, you look like you're going to have a bad time.
Do you want the truth?
How long has it been since we've had this gathering?
Don't bother.
From today, I intend to dedicate myself to you.
Just get some rest now, you really need it.
My father is busy, following yesterday's shooting, which was external on the land.
We were not destroyed, by God, my brothers, the Secretary was informed, I told him, "Look, no meetings, not press conferences, not television appearances, not even contracts."
Let me be free for the sake of the family a little.
May God be at your aid.
Even when you are busy.
The first thing I will keep in mind.
And I have the number of her owner, I will speak to him today.
I am sorry,
They bought and occupied the Villas from time to time.
He's obsessed with TV series and acting.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor people and live a simple life.
Their share, that is not our business, their share in it.
May God grant you goodness, Uncle.
Hopefully, there is no evil.
Oh father, this car, every other day, it's been bothering us.
It seems the battery is dead.
It's not a problem, don't worry. I have the wound and I will suture it for you now, God willing.
May God reward you with good.
We are ready, we are ready, uncle.
Peace be upon you
That's right, Walid is right.

It's enough, dad.
Here you go / Please go ahead
Just Waleed, what is it?
Rashid Abdullah
same name
Your father's right has returned, he is happy.
I believed the امج.
I was very happy the day I found out that Rashed Abdullah, the actor I love, turned out to be Janna.
All the people praised him.
They say he is humble and kind.
The future is before the house, yes.
I am the one who doesn't film with him.
Because I'm a hard worker, everyone believes me.
I can't believe that our house is attached to the house of actor Rashed Abdullah.
Talk to him, talk to him so he believes.
Goofy the world
What we see on TV.
I wish to see him.
Praise be to God, Yarab, Alhamdulillah, Yarab, الحمدالله يارب
Here is the translation of the provided text: Here is it, if they want a Galebub with a sail, then I have it.
I am, I am present, but I, folks, take it slow, okay? Because right now, I am not fully acclimated to it, I haven't taken enough of it in.
And the news reached you.
By God, he did not fall short. May God reward him a thousand times. I swear by God, he did not fall short. May God reward him a thousand times.
Assalamu Alaikum
They confirmed that some employees are being transferred from the old ministry branch to the new one in Adkhan.
What have they not told you yet?
I haven't heard the names.
No, but what I heard, for sure...
His name is Abu Ali with them.
My name is Ana.
But until we know exactly who we are transferring.

Originally, the committee is still studying the topic.
But if she chooses you.
Visited us, the blessing, oh Abu Waleed, the poison.
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Abu Ali.
Forgiven, bro Rashid, the furniture is on it.
We are neighbors today.
May God make him a deserving person.
This is from your good origin, Abu Walid.
May God reward you with good, O brother Rashid.
I heard about your kindness a lot.
May God always bless love.
Just my daughter.
And I am ready to walk with you until you find the best and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When did he return, frankly, the furniture is very old.
I have to change it.
God willing.
I told her, I told her before.
If you need anything.
Consider me like your sister.
May my eye not cause tears.
Where did you go, my love?
Yesterday she called me and I forgot to ask her.
No, my love, I'm not going to tire you.
No more.
Yalla, with salama. I'll call later.
Honestly, I was talking to her.
But these people are not of our kind.
Them the rich, where are we, and where are they?
Okay, here is th
What's up, mom?
You just wait for me a little bit.
And I will give you the signal as to when you propose to her for me.
I killed you.
No, oh my mother, don't worry.
And you'll show me and you'll say, "My fiancé is here."
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you want to have dinner.
Now I will let the driver take her to university, God willing.
And then we agreed that we are people.
Who owns the car?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Yes, Ouyawid and they love good, yes indeed.
By God, you are right, oh father.
Even if our parents don't do this.
And my name is definitely with them.
Are you sure?
Oh my God, what a calamity, what misfortunes that befall us.
I don't know how I will react to this news.
Go, go, go, go, go, you are now, God willing, God willing, good, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you
May your endings be good, Abu Ali.
The committee convened today.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: And I compiled a list of the names they are moving the smoke from.
My name is Wayahem.
Tell the manager to fire you.
I don't think there's any benefit, Ali. I don't think there's any benefit.
I asked him and he told me there is no hope.
The great artist.
Consider your name not to be placed in the list.
Thank you, you did not fall short, by God, oh Abu Salem.
He returned, if you please.
I wish to film with you so I can tell the kids.
Oh, my children will have fun now.
May God keep them for you, God willing.
An artist's picture.
Under your command, may God keep you safe.
Here you go, here you go.
Ava upon you, Ava upon you, present (yours).
You and those you cherish.
Tell me at least a day or two in advance.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Yallah yallah yammah, ista'iddi.
Get ready, get ready, what is it?
What's wrong with you, you little guy?
She said I have no objection.
Let his mother come.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Let's go to them.
Just my son, that's all.
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people and that's all we are.
You must get all dressed up.
From where for me to wear and get fancy.
It seems you have involved me with people.
What's wrong with you, showing off jewelry? It's the first time I've seen you like this.
It's not my right.
The right of Umm Ali.
Umm Ali is arranging a marriage for her son Ali.
You want decent clothes and some jewelry.
As she said, she wants to show them that they are important people, reliable, and have good fortune.
Oh my, God bless.
Who is capable?
Mashallah, this is her. This is my princess. She got long and blue.
God has blessed the hand that made this.
Malkah mashallah alaij malkah
You too still need to prepare.
Because they are saying, let my father come and meet her father.
Definitely not going in these clothes.
As soon as I saw them like this, I was like "wow, my new attitude is so different!"
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: **"Hey grandma, take it easy, gently with the groceries."**
Umm Walid, meaning she didn't shortchange you. She gave you her things. So, a little patience with them.
That's not
Zain, we need to become like them as well.
Why didn't his mother go propose to him?
Just those women.
Now I have to go check on the men later.
By God, may He deliver you, just as you are, without improvement.
The rest is, may God keep you safe, the suit.
The charitable people did not fall short.
They did not fall short, we remained in the coat.
That's it, I will take it from you and complete the count.
Everyone is evading you.
My brother Rashid, how am I supposed to give him something like that, or to lend him the bisht?
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: Don't just look, come, first.
This one must be closed.
Yes, yes, he/she/it flatters me.
Put a little more cloth on you, but look.
This God bless you.
The left hand inside the bisht.
He threatened to destroy this form.
The desire for the shawl, that which is underneath.
God, God.
Greetings
The walk, the walk, a heaviness, a desire for heaviness, a little.
This appears to
That's like you're a millionaire.
Did they not give you, God willing, a few seconds?
The left side is like this, the right side, this color.
I met my friend Aisha.
What's wrong with her?
You know, it would tell me...
You tell me from how much you are my friend and we don't want to part.
I swear to my brother, he will go propose to you.
Tell the truth about your behavior, don't say anything about her brother and put yourself in an awkward situation.
I've received many letters lately, and for a while now, Suad has been telling me that she needs me for her uncle, and today, she needs me for her brother.
They want to take my girlfriend.
And I am sitting and looking.
They don't know the relationship between us.
No, they don't know. It's just that we are colleagues.
That's it, then.
From tomorrow, they must know.
Why did Walid reject him?
I am screaming
You refuse my son Walid.
Actor Ashraf from you, O hypocrites!
As for you
You have acted throughout your life.
It's not your roles.
Serve the people.
You are attracting people to you.
You wear the clothes of acting in life, before God and His creation.
The suit in which I acted on television.
It's me, not you.
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
and I played a role
That you got married.
I don't understand.
A man walks in front of his wife.
The house is like this, with a balcony.
And he does not turn to the right or to the left.
Brother, remind me of that awesome company you guys are talking about, the one you have in the office with you?
Come with a boy and a girl.
Why does he walk like that?
As he says
May God help him, oh Real.
Walk straight, don't stop.
Poor, he has no personality at all.
Laughs after being happy.
We wore our grandma's clothes.
No no no, come on, that's not beautiful and you're sitting.
It's nice like this with walking while standing, get up stand up get up stand up
I asked you, Khamees, I asked you.
What's wrong? I'm going to the city.
Come, I want to talk to you a little.
Where are you going? Stay with me, just a little while.
I ruined him, his wife.
You wouldn't like it like this.
Ah, oh, oh, Khamees.
The television was turned off, and if a female broadcaster were to appear...
Oh my, I'm so scared you're going to get angry and do something to me, like make me have bad luck or something.
And, by God Almighty, at work!
Honestly, I'm honestly sitting with Salim, my friend at work.
Something
I blocked the line, Yod, Yod.
She hung up the phone, now, soon, she's going to give me trouble at home.
Now you're saying you didn't let go, meaning your friend is accusing you of sitting with them often.
I mean, come on, now, now it might arrive. God help those who are expelled.
And it will kick you out.
You are not the first to fire.
No, I can't.
My mother, in her grave, is the sweetest.
My mother, or
She told me, "I will not divorce."
No, I can't, it's impossible.
I'm looking for something you...
No translation provided.
You are completely not normal.
Do not give me and you.
Tell me, I mean, I want to understand what's happening.
No, Mom, I mean, I won't allow you to say these things.
Salem, in particular, is considered one of the best young people we have in the area.
He used to tell you to divorce.
He came back to tell me, "Enough, enough! Means, stay calm, be a storm, release, what's the use?"
It's Thursday, it's true. You look like you're joking officially.
Leave me, leave me, and whoever gives you (the means to leave).
Hey, I'm talking to him by ourselves, how nice we are.
May God guide you.
The poor one breaks the heart.
My father will give him the message, it came from the minister's office, it's important.
Gives from God, may He guide you, gives from.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: ه لالا ولاشي ولاشي
Here it is, I'll take it and deliver it to him.
To the meeting tomorrow with the female delegation that is coming.
A women's delegation.
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, you're not sleeping tonight?
Salem
I am your brother, Khamees.
I swear to God, I will talk to you properly, I swear to God.
My brot
They crossed out my name so I wouldn't block, dude.
How do you mean we cross out your name?
It means the only one who can cross out your name is here, His Excellency the Minister, and that's it.
My brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Meeting and official drawing
Who are you arguing with?
Salem Salem Salem
Tell me the truth.
Who were you arguing with, while hiding behind the tank?
Salem, Salem, by God, Salem.
and as long as you keep arguing with Salim
Are you going to say it or what?
Ali, me.
Not on me, oh Khammas.
Didn't you say the truth, huh?
I don't have any casual items with me.
I complained about her, brother, saying I was arguing with someone.
What a life, man.
And whoever will deliver you, safe, call.
And the one who will hand you over, so that you can be saved.
Here's the translation of the provided text: Here's the one who told you to call.
It's none of your business.
I don't interfere in what doesn't concern you, or you'll know what I'm capable of with you.
I will complain about you.
Hello, it's you.
How are you living with someone who has a long tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
May your life be long, Hassan is going to call Khamees.
Okay, let's discuss first the property budget, then.
Here you go / Please help yourself
Let's God, may He find him.
I'll tell you, as soon as he saw the women, he was afraid.
I wrapped the ministry all around you, and you're hiding here.
Oh God, God, the group is waiting for you in the conference room.
I couldn't sit with women.
Oh Khamees, how is your wife, you don't know?
I'm afraid she will call.
Balaal Tebiha Atshak Fini Ad Bal Al Yi Ma Tafham Intu
Will I be back in Ireland and what I carried, after what brought me back home?
Your wife will only call at this hour.
Of course, you as a large company.
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry.
One of the largest projects in the history of the ministry.
Hey everyone, what's wrong with the table, it's shaking.
No, long live you, not at this table, I am.
Here you go, my reply.
Who is with me?
Syrian, who is asking for it?
My phone for law.
Hold on, hold on, I'll tell you.
Originally, here he fainted because he was afraid to go to their house.
Here's the
He said to her, "If you continue in your work, this is what you have with women. Don't enter the house."
That's why he submitted a letter to the ministry to be transferred from our department.
Exactly, and himself telling me that the minister approved to transfer him, meaning he did what you wanted, what do you want after?
My brother, what is this wife of his?
This one wants.
Yeah, what am I going to say, Khamees? I'm talking to who?
I'm telling you, you're not sober.
Now, what will you do, since it's not just your wife and children who are coming tomorrow?
By God, I don't know what to do.
And you fulfilled her request. Why after I've made you return home and see your children?
Because she wants to make sure officially.
Okay, here is
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: **"So this is what I did. I sent her brother. I gave him the paper."**
Because she saw the minister's signature and was assured.
God willing, if she agrees, then God willing, tonight we can go home, God willing.
My sister, and this is the minister's signature.
after what happened
Tomorrow he will report to the new department.
From tomorrow, I will have an office and a job different from the one I had.
Which direction is this part, God bless you.
God bless you, and this is the minister's visa.
Nothing, nothing, that's in your right hand.
Yes, yes, God bless.
Here is your ready-made program.
And Saad, and Abdulqader, and Mashallah, meaning an office, a big one, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a transfer?
Man, the whole department is women.
The lady is present.
And no one can make a second decision except the Minister himself.
You are forced to stay and work until the minister returns.
Brother, you agree with your female colleagues.
And you call them by their true names, because your wife is not recognized.
And I left for you two more increases for the new employee.
The new employee, you mean the new staff member.
From Jamn, the office of the minister has been transferred, and a daily amount of one hundred and fifty thousand Saudi Riyals is being paid to us.
Really?
And he looks like he's laughing, and imagine a man who is mercenary among five women, he looks antique.
They are just saying his wife is jealous of him, a crazy kind of jealousy.
By a blind eye.
Poor, but he manages.
Here's the translation of the provided text into English: "He just asked if his wife called, for us not to talk to them, and to be silent."
Ahmed, the one with you in the office.
This is not expensive for you. Look at it, is it your size or not?
My son called to say, "My wife is about to give birth in the office."
What are you doing?
Right, that's the way, the first door on the right.
This is the care office.
With his five wives.
Here are some employees.
He is present, I have attested that he is, and he is persistent.
This is not the way with these kinds of actions.
This is my wife, she gets jealous of me.
Because I am beautiful.
Now, may God guide you, O Sultan.
We are the only ones who want to know where we have reached.
My uncle, what happened was that my brother, Falcon, and I were at the bank yesterday.
Look, from this aspect, the project...
Peace be upon you
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Come on, go to the kitchen quickly, come on.
Now I'm wearing it, I'm going out.
Originally, it was supposed to be your place, the kitchen.
We don't have women, I won't obey the men, God willing.
And scorpions, if angered, God is sufficient to ward off the harm of their sting.
These are essential for rain, essential, look, look.
Look, my uncle.
Living, and whoever greets you, call the secretary and tell him to inform the employees.
He tells them that his meeting was postponed from today to tomorrow.
God willing.
They issue these orders.
And woe to us if we do not execute!
They should know that I am a high-level person.
And review the associations and responsibilities.
To them, a woman is a servant and nothing more.
In my life, I have not seen people who despise women as much as they do.
Still living, those were the old days.
Come, don't go to work, and come to the kitchen and make us something to eat.
Where are the maids?
And the second one is wandering, it's been a week.
Even the maids were not spared their humiliations.
They are right to fire them.
May God help you.
The following text was translated into English, and only the English translation is printed: **Previously noted by the bank are simple.**
The following
My uncle, what does it mean? What are they trying to say?
Originally a compound of villas, it has no charm, not even a garden.
Okay, the garden now.
My sister, before I leave, I will take your opinion on the subject.
Habibti Fatom, I have to go late to work.
Okay, come on, tell me what's going on.
Are you saying, or should I go?
And play it at school.
The committee of the General Union has returned.
And the school chose me to play with them in the national team.
Who are you?
Now you're telling me you're going to the national team?
You know, if you think about it, you'd be telling your siblings and cousins these things. What are they going to do to you?
You only blame yourself.
This is us, we warned you.
Cursing, what are you saying? I pass by it, greet it. I haven't seen you in a long time, oh father.
Cursing his year, his year is not filling you.
Did they marry
Oh God, guide you.
Who will take one, not for enjoyment, learning, with a certificate, knowing anything, may God guide you.
Lalala, what a shame about the real (royal) one, that he is not educated.
And then this is Khamees, son of the Scorpion.
He was bitten/stung/held.
No, and we will not take anyone except someone at their level.
His scorpion is like him.
May God help you.
What should I do, Aisha?
Whoever traveled, the minister and all transactions are transferred to me.
And tell the truth, Mustafa, the director of the Resources Management Department. Amira wants to see you tomorrow.
That's right, the ministry guests arrived today.
The program is with you.
And now I will dedicate myself to you, oh living one.
Mary
Okay, come on, everyone, now, come on!
What would you say, Aisha?
These calamities, from where did they originate, other than from these brothers?
I don't know what's happening.
Please, my love, you need compresses so your face doesn't get swollen.
We warned her and told her not to tell them.
She went and told them that Jean was about to hit her and wanted to.
You know, if I were to tell them, they would hate it.
Jan, you're annoying her for a long time.
You play football.
Next time, break his neck.
Know who is contacting you.
The old Scorpion.
This is how big?
Yeah, but uncle, I didn't dislike Sultan, he just did.
Hey, talk.
I chose Economics and Political Science.
I honestly chose Graphic because these days this major is in demand.
Architecture
It's not your turn.
You took your chance.
Greed is not good, and I am your father.
Tamer, you scorpion.
Knock it, break it, break its teeth, dissolve it.
They gifted it to me.
Here it is, precisely as requested: **Here it is, precisely as requested:** **Not adding any explanations:**
Will you go on the missions?
And the architecture engineering major was discontinued.
Take your comfort.
To ensure
Sultan and Falcon, I spoke to them.
They have no objection to your marrying an amira.
I want after.
Our son, Khamees, who is deserving.
Arrange the meeting with them and inform you, God willing.
Nominated from within the delegation
I appreciate your circumstances.
But give yourself a chance for later.
I'm telling you the truth.
You are very much interested in yourself.
And a filter from above.
His words are correct.
My brothers, and I know them.
Impossible, they will agree.
I am surprised by them.
Their car payments will be on my salary.
And it is me who provides for the house.
Oh, I wish she would still tell me she's traveling with me.
We are the ones invited to marry her this week.
What would you say?
Stupid, brainless, and without even a high school diploma.
Marry him and travel with him.
Oh, the knowledge, God!
By God, it is a shame what they are doing.
If you refuse, they will slaughter her.
Oh father, how many times have I told you?
After you leave.
From tomorrow, from tomorrow, God willing.
Don't worry, my original is Scorpio, born of Scorpions.
Even if I give you a piece, it's not going to be enough.
I don't want to get married on Thursday.
Go and go to the kitchen.
Put them in the living room.
Tonight is the match between Real Madrid and Barcelona.
God willing, they won't defeat us Valencia.
I am communicating with you from reliable sources.
Her dedication and hard work in her job.
What do you think about what happened now?
We fought to do.
Against our will, we will attend.
Please take your seats.
Thank you, may your life be long.
The translation of "ط طال
Cast it there.
The minister sought him.
May God protect her and grant her a long life. She is present.
Here are a few
Good evening, Madam Minister.
Yes, long may your life be.
I washed the towels.
Go pour a coffee for Captain Emad.
By the way, after...
We are traveling tomorrow to China. We will play a match there.
Captain Nassib, after I've introduced you to my sister Maryam.
What where are you going, uncle? You are going, oh my, a land of milk and honey!
You are a donkey. You are a donkey.
You don't know your elbow from your wrist, you want to take a minister?
God willing, say hi.
Here you go: **For you, my aunt.**
Go, put what's in it and be another.
Actor communications
Do you honestly think it was only a few minutes ago that Mashael called you?
I'll tell her later.
Shame on you, look for everything, nothing is right for Mashael's sake.
Nawaf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
It seems like a
Okay, why don't you take Mary's place?
Where does it suit her more?
The role of Nov thirty.
Let's get rid of this unwanted obligation they've imposed upon us in the committee.
This is a problem. I am sure that he will not be quiet.
And he stands for us at the single.
He speaks to you about art, family values, purposeful art, and what you don't know.
This is one of the things he put for us in the committee.
The minister is the one who created the problem for the committee.
I, you, and Hamid can influence him, but that's all.
Impossible.
Because originally there is nothing that proves it is mine or the one who bears the blessing.
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks.
After he finds our names.
May God keep you, the company is registered in the name of Hamid's wife.
Don't worry about that side.
Then you can be assured, who is the chairman of the committee, it's not me.
That final decisive word will be mine.
No dad, everything is fine. Come on, come on.
Tony spoke to them and agreed to everything with them.

Hello professor Rashid, please come in.
And as you all know, you all know that this meeting is specifically for the girl, so the approval of the series "Rape of the Conscience"
Wahohu, produced by the Modern Touches Foundation for Arts.
A Sweet Stranger, Bold, Action.
I am with Hamed.
Honestly, the story of the series is very beautiful.
I am with you, Hamed.
What I liked most was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor.
And she went to put the gun in, when she was shot in the car.
Don't you know this is the car of its action, an action on a day when police searched.
Which of her children is from school?
What cartoon is about him?
He gives him that strong shot, and the cardboard flies in and enters through the wall's door.
Here is
Oh my, here's that moment, that moment, and the cartoon Dash hitting his mother's room.
It is a beautiful thing that a local company has reached this level of business.
We must encourage them and take their side.
Except for Mr. Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion.
You made it happen, Mr. Rashid.
With all due respect for your opinions and impressions about this series, which is called "Rape of Conscience," I find myself in a difficult position.
And a rape of human values.
Ugliness and surprises.
A person and a half in every episode.
Leave it for the next episode.
A series written without social consciousness.
It does not carry a meaningful message that elevates society.
The tears are falling, meaning I have to cry for the viewer.
Rashid, please.
You said your opinion, so he said his opinion. I said my opinion. Let Mr. Rashid come and say his opinion after.
It is clear from the conversation.
It means I'm sitting and smelling a deal between you.
Clear up the matters.
Some people understand, and that is their specialty. And some people have no connection to the topic.
I refuse to watch this series.
I am afraid he will involve us and create problems for us.
Never mind him.
What will he do, or is he able to do anything?
I stand by my word.
Jan gives me the bag and says this is from Mama Samira.
I don't know what's going on.
I can't believe it, Nasser!
Here is the new series that we will definitely produce.
Those whose information they have, are raping their daughter.
From the abundance of good that is between us because of it.
The first good thing, of course, is this beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
On behalf of Hamid's wife, who sent the ring to him.
And of course, my husband's role was to take care of the matters and issues.
He has a stake of five percent in the business.
Good role
Tony, I am representing him, and I am acting in a role like this. You didn't see a series about rape, " أماني تائهه " (Lost Amani), it was very beautiful.
By the way
Something, rape, rape, what, oh my God.
Any rape of dreams
Why are all the names like this, similar?
Last year, for example, series were mostly all girls.
I mean, you find the series has, above, eight girls and, the, ten after.
Duroug Madmun
How many Moshahirs do we have?
Oh oh, your luck has come after what you wanted?
Hello Omar
Here's the tra
My dear, I really have to go to work. What's happening, Mary?
Delay for a minute and go.
He says he needs me for an urgent and important matter.
I have to go there.
I know that Rashid went and met the minister.
They say he sat with him for half an hour.
He said to you, "They will get you involved."
I'll tell you, we complained to them, you tell me good.
What happened now, what happened is that the minister's office called me, saying they wanted me.
And after the minister believed him, fear took hold.
Minister, I meet with him.
The Real Madrid jersey is coming, it will reach its face in the series.
No more.
This is indeed correct, may your age be long.
First, I am an assistant to the Minister. I wanted to clarify a point, and this is not something from my nature to speak about a fellow artist who is with me and is not present.
God bless you, Rashid, and everyone who knows about this feature.
He bears resentment towards everyone around him.
All that matters is material gain.
But he is also specialized.
Just may God keep you meaning not everyone comes and gives you their replacement for technical matters.
Particularly television works.
God bless you, that's what we've been working on.
A huge, bold, audacious undertaking.
At the Gulf level, God keep you safe, we will have a media precedence.
And a staggering spread.
You obviously, this is your specialty and you know it better than me.
A hollow condition, a serialized IP address, the face.
And he raises our name above.
As for what the journalist, Abdel Hamid, wrote, **listen, listen, listen.**
Indeed, one of the actors commented saying
The series contains immoral calls.
He regrets the decline in moral and artistic taste in his work.
By God, it is a bold statement and a strong criticism.
Your group will be humiliated if journalist Abdel Hamid investigates them.
And if their words reach the officials...
These are intelligent people who know how to manage it.
This is a gang.
We want us to create our own private website.
We put all the company's activities into it.
You told me the company's name.
From now on, you are the media advisor.
And the series "Rape of Conscience," which is overseen by its production company, Mercury Production Art.
Jump, a qualitative leap in Arabic drama.
For what it carries of noble thought and values.
It is a series aimed at developing society.
Journalist Abdel Hamid himself, who has been criticizing them since day one.
It's unbelievable how steep the angle is, it's a steep 180 degrees.
How can this Abdul Hamid allow himself to be treated in this manner?
Journalist Abdelhamid Wesshap and his likes.
Rest assured, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me, "What do you think of the series?" I told him, "The series is whitewashing at a national level for the Arab world."
God hears you.
Folks, my artistic sensation is telling me our series is about to get hit.
That we don't know where its lands are.
This is how it is put: he puts his bag, he goes.
Not at the beginning, I don't encourage it.
You are all like this, the things you bring in series, when we don't see them in our lives or hear about them.
The writing speaks from its address.
Frankly, all of your authors are children.
What will happen if it doesn't happen?
Your series is bad, bad.
What do you think?
He seems to be shouting and calling out a lot.
And that's it, we are the benchmark for trivial TV series.
Not everyone can understand it and pick it up from the first time.
In threads and hidden dimensions, there is a need for concentration so that one can fully grasp what one intends to convey through this work.
By the way, this work, it's actually political.
It is forbidden to expose it to people.
What's wrong with you?
Those who find you like this will say they are eating poison.
Yesterday, Morocco, Ali and I were in Souq Waqif.
And they are sitting in a coffee shop.
He didn't pay me any attention.
Nasser, what do you think about the topic? Because if the Minister is upset, this is a big problem.
During one week, he makes us all stay at home.
God and the series are equal, truly, what is this, everyone who opposed him is saying he is a failure.
I hear that Rashid is planning to go to him.
And surely he tells him, "I didn't tell you that this series is a failure, a failure, and has no action in it."
Oh my God, guys.
Let's keep the topic on it.
And they will see what Nasser will do.
Listen to me, Eli.
From now on, there will be no topic posted on your page that criticizes the series.
Please, Eli.
I was aware of the topic a few days ago. There is no criticism of the work. There is only an attack on the work.
Please don't make me upset with you.
He circled it / He poked at it.
But one day I had a chance.
If I were not, I would not pass such a talk ever.
Just for honesty, after I received no message thanking me for the series.
What, what, what is the unprecedented success?
Goodbye
Allow me, Mr. Rashid.
I believe you, or I believe the newspapers.
Rape of Conscience, a pearl of television works.
May your age be long, this is a journalist we agree with.
Listen to the second newspaper, what are they writing?
After, they agree with the people. Read. Read in the Readers Section.
My heart stopped.
Let me just say, they better tell me.
Yes, Dad, who are you? The minister is satisfied with you.
By God, the truth, oh Nasser.
Prepare for the rape of the conscience, part two.
No, my brother doesn't want this one, it's contagious.
The first and last series I will write.
I'm busy with my work, man, scraping is more rewarding for me than this whole job.
Part two, following this calamity.
Third and fourth
What's wrong with you? Don't you want the benefit?
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: **"There's one of the guys sitting in his living room."**
This is where we are.
The magician said.
And forward!
We want a word suitable for this success.
Thank God for the success.
To the doubters, enemies of success.
I was surprised.
How can the series Ivus win the award while a series is bad and a failure?
Just these people are specialists.
They gave him the awards, of course they see something we don't see.
Prepare a second part for the series for us.
May God grant him a long life.
They only called him a magician when he actually was one.
Reminding you: the rape of conscience, part two.
I saw you were standing with the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals, we agreed, meaning.
I hear him telling them to prepare, as there is still a second part.
The same.
The dirty hands they put into the banks to wash them and come out clean.
These are the series that I find to be weak, poor, vile, and trivial.
They are entering the Gulf and Arab festivals.
To clean them, to make them shine, they give her prizes and it becomes a high-class series for people to watch as she cleans them.
Why isn't it reasonable?
As long as the judging panels themselves are the entities that produce the series.
Assalamu Alaikum
And peace and mercy be upon you. Thank God you have arrived.
Okay, here is the translation of your text, without any added
Come to the office.
We are not in a small bakery or a shop that sells roti and bread.
We are one of the largest baking companies in the world.
Do not bring down a single dollar.
They want, or we will cancel the contract.
Enough is the contract we signed yesterday.
With the European company.
What is the English translation of "كي كب دبليو اب"؟
What you see
Big work done. Work that has never been done.
For the first time, a live product will be the first product in the world.
This is what I brought, not the biggest roti maker in the world.
I am telling you.
How do you tie it with a string?
You will stop it with your own hand, or you will go to the kitchen yourself, searching for an hour to find a prisoner until you cut him, and sometimes, you might even cut off your hand.
Eat this soft bread with a zipper.
Has the cheese been put, and the lid closed?
This is a skirt, it is a pant.
No, you are the truth. The bag, the backpack. How then, how is it possible?
Abu Nasser and this disease, how is it thrown away?
Based on that, when someone leaves work, they tell their friend, "I just had two Fritos."
A hospital dough, Mountains of Light, why didn't it go to them yesterday?
I know, I am asking you why you didn't go yesterday.
The story, long live the king, is that the bakers and the goldsmiths, whose work is honored, supervise the goldsmiths.
Reply, the bakers have not yet responded.
This is what happened, your highness.
What are you doing, sitting there screaming at him like this?
I'm sitting here with this mess of balls, whether it's a ball or not, and you've ruined my work.
Do you know your son likes soccer?
What's the big deal if he takes a few employees from the company and amuses himself with them?
You have four hundred employees in the company here, and what have you taken?
This is the translation of the provided text into English: "A total of eleven, these are considered the main players."
And above them, after he had taken for himself four as a reserve, and two as administrative personnel, but what he had taken and upon him was seventeen, just that.
And the team's media spokesperson.
He made this story about these messages.
But I manage to get by until I develop, with the fact that the fans, I mean the audience, consider the most important player on the field and the player number twelve.
Let him enjoy them, they are giving Iraq, he is in front of them and he is happy.
And we are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now, here is the day he told you, "I want to play football." First, I struggled for him.
He heard your words and obeyed you.
He didn't do anything.
Now, in order to make him have a little fun, some employees were gathered, and he started making them play right in front of him, looking at them, and enjoying himself, having fun with them. But then, he would get upset.
What I didn't tell him is that he won't be able to hire employees.
Even if some of your quarters need employees, they will likely only give you one-quarter of what they need.
The important baking masters.
Hey mom, may God guide you, what's the point of taking important bakers when it's not even going to happen?
Second time, if you're going to hire employees, tell me.
No, no, this transaction, let Hamdi review me in it.
Hamdi is in the hospital.
Why hasn't anyone told you, may your age be long?
I finished work, and as I was leaving to get into my own car...
Listen to you, may God prolong his life, he will call out for
I walked on it.
The goalkeeper who plays with us, they haven't found him, and tonight we have an important match.
Tell us what they don't know. Look for a goalkeeper for us, and get us to the stadium.
He said what are you wearing, a goalkeeper.
I have never played football or held a football.
This is a situation.
What cannot be ignored.
Tomorrow, you too, we'll find you a job to work in, come on, no more wasting time, no more football, no more nonsense.
Let me tell you.
Dad, you want me to disband the team and cancel it properly.
Yes, that is correct.
Okay, here is the translation of the Arabic text, as requested: **"Zain, by God, God willing, this is for this face, but I am asking you."**
It's forbidden, meaning to take the team out and to ruin the final match.
No, there is no right for the child with this one and him.
Here's what you said.
Congratulations on the win.
Mr. Nasser, congratulations on winning the cup!
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I am organizing the team, meaning psychologically, physically, and mentally, and thank God the coach hasn't been remiss.
Inside your hotel
Congratulations to all of you, and the party as I promised you.
I say, your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he's embarrassed and trying to be polite.
Here's the translation of the text, as requested: **Translation:** Abu Nasser's uncle, seemingly at the beginning, and with prayers for the Prophet, they want to bless you for your big victory in your team, which is very, very big, the team of international bakeries.
This is a great victory!
May God bless you. May God bless, no no no no.
A picture without an abaya, wait, wait, hold on a moment.
No.
Is there a tradition of wearing a suit?
Without a doubt, the great care, concern, and creative ideas you had, had a major role in this victory.
And the coach drew it.
But in the end, he played with a five-two-three-one formation.
And as a great athlete, you learn that changing the plan confuses the players. Yet, the bakery team was not confused and provided a wonderful game.
And the coach drew it.
Mr. Nasser, given your position as the premier athlete, what advice would you offer to international players?
Until the end of time.
هلا هلا
May your life be long.
Greeted with them is Hamoud Sultan.
Greetings, may God bless them, it would be an honor to have them, perhaps they would join us for dinner or something.
Dinner is ready.
May God bless you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is just now...
Envy us then.
What does it mean?
BO AbdulAziz
Agent for the machines we use in the factory.
Did you see how
This is the person you wish you knew.
Football introduced me to him and I hinted to him.
You killed him, Abu Abdulaziz.
And you have always been far from hatred.
And it's none of your business.
The ball is in his possession, I see it between us, fifty centimeters, meaning I am close to it.
Abu Nasser has not arrived yet.
No, by God, today he also didn't come.
At a seminar on sports injuries, which he sponsored, he was inevitably present.
I haven't seen anything yet.
I saw the building behind the bakery that was going to be converted into housing for workers.
Hello, he drowned in football.
As we have accustomed you, our dear viewers, before every match, we meet a symbol of sports and have a dialogue with them.
This man inspires the baking team with his great ideas.
What's the news of the International Bakery Team? We heard that you are undertaking a comprehensive development process.
Here I am, at these desks, enduring this hardship.
A tiny sum, meaning I'm earning all this effort for a mere $1 million.
Don't mind it, you've gone a bit soft lately, you've gone a bit soft.
Haidi was your mistake, not mine. My brother Shaheen...
It was my fault.
What's wrong, it's me.
But you didn't tell me that the players are wanted in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf can reach unbelievable prices.
The player who has gotten two hundred thousand.
Here in the Gulf, they pay him three and four million dollars.
Make me understand, Mr. Massoud, how.
Establish a fax from me here
Show him in front of me while he is present.
I'll tell you again, my father bought four new players for this team, not to mention the new shipment that includes four players.
Here is the translation of the provided text: Here is what this is, this is astonishing, this is putting you in a state, with Billy, with Ronaldino, this is all in his hide.
This is written for eight hundred thousand.
True, my father is true, but this price, God bless you, was put up by a club from Turkey.
They want it in the UAE for about 2.2 billion.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we examine the goods?
Certainly, you have it.
The man's duck.
Okay, then
No, I will not give you everything, it is not guaranteed.
Fat, God bless, this is good, fat.
This is a المرتكاز. This is a true foundation.
The smooth muscle
This is the humid muscle, the most important thing for a player. If it breaks after there's no benefit.
You were not at all negligent.
I don't know if they will reach us, the club. The club... what did I say, the club?
What's the matter?
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Let's go, Hamdi. We're moving.
With blessings, with blessings.
This God blesses you with sprouts.
Yes, I will bring them from the jungles of Africa, what can we do for them?
Here's the translation of the provided text: **Original:** انعلفهم انربيهم انربربهم بعدين عاد انهدهم ف الملاعب **Translation:** We will teach them, raise them, and again raise them. Then, we will destroy them in the playgrounds.
I didn't ask for anything. I didn't ask for your nose, oh take it. Take it, father, take it. Take it with you, spaciousness in the car or I'll carry you in the BMW.
He had never seen them pushing us before.
Can the striker come down for me?
Cacakakanowa makalali dundah laa
The translation
This is the thing that should be put down.
Our coach is stupid.
God willing, on Mars.
God willing, not Spain, on Mars.
I'm not impressed with his way of reading the game's narration.
This walks a line.
The match has its rules.
God willing, in two days.
What's wrong? Your voice is reaching up high.
This guy is from this Berme, Spain.
He won't convince himself that the coach is an idiot who doesn't understand football.
Listen, listen, Mitsu is saying something, please be quiet.
And he knows that the attacker of the struggle, cellulotiquaawa, is from the area of the penalty, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said, and he knows how to position himself.
Nobody will hurt your head.
Stay away.
And I know how to deal with this coach.
Why did the team retreat?
The one who is supposed to be sitting, should now make the team, a trained, focused team, think about changing in the middle of the match.
Because the players are not playing in their natural positions.
And the player TakolamahakaKukulalalalaloo, this is not his natural place, he must move to the place where he always plays.
The coach is right, he will change.
Coconut shell is used for making bowls.
God willing, God willing, God willing.
What is happening on the field?
What is happening now, which should not be happening with the team manager present.
Team coach
If anything, they will bring it up for what happened after the game.
Now everyone is sitting and watching, and everyone is sitting and watching, and the thing is right in front of the camera.
The ball is played in the goal. Fourth goal for Al-Najah Team.
A goal is scored for the fourth time, and he is the star of today's match.
This coach is stubborn.
His words: "Enough, Uncle Bonasser doesn't want you as a coach for his team."
What else is there, man?
I am watching the game on TV, and you, stay on the bench. And what I am telling you to do, do it!
My son, don't make a fool of yourself like this, it's not good.
Now tomorrow we have a match how can we play without a coach
What did your father do?
That's it, Rashid.
What's wrong, mother? You've broken my heart. What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong.
Separate me, oh mother, separate me.
How did he divorce you?
I don't know, mom, I don't know.
How can he divorce you when you haven't had a month since you got married?
I swear to God, I don't know, I don't know, I don't...
It means from me and the path is divorced.
yes mom yes
Yima, I swear to God, I don't know how he entered my place and suddenly told me to go home to my parents.
I killed him, he told me enough, divorce you, you are divorced.
I'm by myself, I swear I don't know the story.
A married couple is separating. What are people saying about us?
I am with you.
By God, I will tell you.
I actually didn't know he divorced her until you told me now.
Stay seated for a minute and then depart.
From her high morals.
Saturday Barcelona
The eyes of Abdullah.
Yani returned, with tears on his cheek.
He says, "Mom, I watched a match between Barcelona and... oh, I'm a huge fan of this team, and I really respect them."
Does she go after him, insult him, and wound his feelings?
He told me, "Mom, I quit Barcelona. I told him, "Enough. What do you want from her? Let her go. Divorce her, bye bye, you can have someone else."
I tell him your daughter got divorced because she left FC Barcelona.
Just for this reason, he divorces her. Seriously, you.
I am not at all like you.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text: Here is the wound to feelings easy.
Wife stabs husband in his loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
The girl who doesn't respect world teams doesn't obligate us.
This time she started making fun of Messi.
Problems between couples happen, and we should.
instead of 1 thousand
The girls are many, and if I had a thousand girls, I would wish for you.
Girl, listen to what I'm saying, you're a good person.
That's it, I don't want to hear anything.
And please, I told you not to enter, this is my first son and I know him well.
We told you not to enter.
Now I will get angry at you.
Don't worry, Mom. Don't put that in your mind.
instead of 1 thousand
Just what is it that's bothering him?
But every time her name comes up,
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
I am present, my love.
Poor thing, what's wrong with her?
This girl's name is Mona.
I got married for a month and got divorced.
If he leaves, I'll tell you to shut up, and why you started, you'll die laughing.
We are with him. We want your benefit.
What interest, mother, could there be with someone like this, a divorced man who divorced his wife for a football team?
The hairdresser recognized them and told me the whole story, "Oh my, don't get me involved with him," and "I don't want to be tricked by someone like this."
And you're a professional, your ear is right for those hairdressers who don't know what they're doing.
Do you know how to tell them that I am not agreeing?
Let it get confused and say what it wants.
Good, O ye.
Kill her, kill her, oh daughter, do not cut off your livelihood.
If her livelihood depends on it, then it will become her undoing.
May her livelihood and ours with her not be cut off.
This building is...
He doesn't tell me no.
God is sufficient for me against this vile, stinking, full of stories and talk, woman.
It's just a rumor. They hear it and immediately spread it.
Don't mind her.
Understand her and tell her not to interrupt the door of goodness that is opening for us.
Here he knows how to convince her.
Aren't you a morning person? I mean, right now, are you seriously believing that the man divorced his wife because of a Barcelona sabbatical?
Leave the nonsense away or you will become a crazy person.
Don't miss the opportunity from your hand.
And you will find her, and she will be the reason, and there is something or a flaw in her that made him divorce her.
Listen to me, daughter of people, do not become loose with the one from two towers.
What is this after two towers?
But those who are close to discovering it have found that it is two towers.
That's why they named his father Shaheen, who had two towers.
May God grant you life.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: or nonono sweet thank you merci
Hey, no need for that, please.
May your age be long, they have already requested, you have signed, and they have spent the money, that's it.
Your excellency is not focused and it is clear that your responsibilities are many. This is from a month, your excellency.
This is from the month of the initial wedding, and now it's a new wedding. Abdullah divorced.
And before that, he was married and divorced.
Yes, this is the third wedding happening now.
That's all there is to it, brother. Just hold him a little.
Man, this is a tough generation.
The opinion and the other opinion.
With blessings, with blessings, oh mother.
Yummy, don't forget, the fur is not mine, I put it on top of the bag.
To hold it in your hand while you are riding the plane.
Find what I put down in London.
Hey dad, you guys aren't planning on going to London, are you?
Hello, mom.
Okay, here is
Because she is with us and she does shopping a lot.
Malaysia Malaysia
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
Goodbye, mom.
What's wrong with her now?
What do I know?
Here's the translation of the Arabic text you provided: "This ahwa (coffee) is right before your eyes. Ask it, or I don't know what the story is."
What's wrong, father? What's wrong? What's happening?
She did something to her, she didn't give her any attention.
Girl, from over there.
Originally, here she is on her honeymoon. She's supposed to put you in her eyes, serve you with her hands, feet, and knees.
Is it possible she is sitting while you are pouring may?
No, and the cup is near you, I won't move it for you to drink.
Alone, not well-raised.
Jan, I killed her. I am the one who brought me up. My mother, while she was drinking me water with her own hands.
What's wrong with her?
It seems she is very sad.
This is what she's with, then.
This girl's name is Masha'el.
Poor thing, she just got divorced and she's on her honeymoon.
I will not believe you even if I tell you to.
May God bless you, my aunt. Thank you.
Your aunt is very particular about your aunts.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked for us.
Hello, Mom.
Oh my, where did you book for us?
Because it was on her mind to go with us there.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
What the heck did he do like that at the airport and what the heck did he do taking the kids?
What's happening between them?
Now you ask me, how would I know what's happening between them?
By God, his absence / separation was great.
Where is Amneh?
Eki was in her room talking to this crazy guy.
Now you tell us, it's been two days she's been calling him, and his phone is off.
I caught it just now.
This is us, waiting to see what's with him.
What makes you think the boy from outside is bothering him? The boy from outside is tired and just wants to be held and comforted.
Oh my, every day I tell her, "Whatever I want, I want apples, peel them, and I won't peel them, it drives me crazy every day!"
Then, you know. I don't like apples with their skins.
The peeled apple.
I will tell you.
You are divorced.
And when necessary.
Go, oh apple of my eye.
I sacrifice myself for you.
Hey, oh you, oh Manal, what did he say?
What's wrong with you? You're the one who's bothered.
Call him three times and tell him "divorce".
Shut up and be grateful.
I don't know, mom, who left me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He's seriously got no clue.
He's right, he's got no story.
She dances two dances for her, three.
Then, no one lived who would divorce my daughter. I swear, it's not him.
How to divorce you?
Come, where are you going?
Where are you going? I'll go cool my heart in this shame. What a shame!
And it has a tail like a peacock's.
Gilded with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
Girls are a toy to you and to your son.
They have no mothers to burn their lips for them.
Those you put in are a laughingstock to you.
And we unleash upon them as we please.
I didn't drink your water, divorce her, she insulted Barcelona, divorce her, let her be dismissed.
She is going to a disco.
He has no life, and no shame.
Minister's agent, born an Arab and a Muslim.
He accused his reputation and the reputation of his children.
You stay still or you move.
Let some humanity remain within you.
My father's right.
Has anyone sold a plot of land like this?
Bo Saqr, take it from my father by force.
And your father, why did he sell it?
May God guide you, Abu Saxar. It means if someone, specifically "he," sets his mind on something, he can effectively tell someone "no."
Leave it to God, oh Real, that's it.
Greetings, welcome, shower, shower.
Oh God, oh God.
What is the status of your project, Mr. Saad?
As you like.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: You didn't say last week that you were going to visit the office.
I told you, I want your project to move, so I have to smooth things out for you and butter the path.
This millionaire, Abu Falcon.
He doesn't eat, no one in this world eats.
This is not a problem, my brother and I will eat it, fill our bellies, and keep our stomachs full. The problem is how to reach him.
And I must find Bu Saqr's key so that the doors open for you.
He was with him during the Umrah, and he greeted him several times.
What you don't need to know, you don't need to know, as long as you spray it, you're fine, but you need to recognize the appropriate opportunity.
I'll tell you, as soon as she told me the secretary that Abu Saqr is waiting for you for dinner.
I immediately borrowed the money and came.
This is Bu Saqr, may God protect him. Every day he makes a dinner.
One Riyal.
He loves this gathering and getting together with people.
How nice this sitting is in this farm, at the end of the night and...
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"How are you, may your age be long? This is Busalir, the owner of the car dealership behind the complex. He has..."**
May your life be long, I would like to get to know you.
Take the license.
My son was the one who got the license.
May God bless you and grant you prosperity.
Congratulations on your A-Level, Owl!
May God bless you.
May God grant you a long life, Abu Falcon.
I asked you, don't refuse me, say "okay" / "it's done".
You just have to say yes, long may you live.
A gift from me to him.
And whoever hands you over, do not refuse me.
My affairs went smoothly.
It means it's okay like that, you met him and told him what you want.
You don't want to become naive either.
Here's the translation,
Help me, I mean how is the method? What did I do?
I have been served by fate.
And we were sitting with him.
Jawad, his son, Falcon, took the license.
A falcon is a gift I have.
If on the car.
Manageable
Come, come, my wealth is with him.
Whatever happened
He was discharged from the hospital.
He had surgery and removed his tonsils.
And of course he will make dinner.
The boy deserves his safety, Your Long Life, Sala.
Get well soon, God willing, he will not experience any harm, God willing.
And we met at a shop selling prayer beads.
I think, by God.
Oh ريال, we've become forgetful, like we've grown older.
They came back and told me the room that was next to ours had your son Shahin in it, and it turned out...
I came back, I said I would visit you.
And I bless you with the safety of Shaheen.
May goodness be with you, by God, listen, oh long-lived one, you will only depart having dined with us.
I don't feel like it.
You say "okay" before.
Appropriate for the release of our precious son Shaaheen from the hospital.
In the tower I have, on the corniche.
That's it, everything is done.
Oh mom, don't be stubborn.
I do not like trade nor do I have any inclination towards it.
Whoever gets a chance in this time begins their trade without capital.
At the vehicle and construction agency, but look, he says yes.
Love from God, and people love you from the love your father had.
Even university
All the doctors love your father and hold him in esteem.
And every night, he takes a third and a quarter of their measure, with him in Paradise.
Mashallah, his father, there's no one he doesn't like. You just need to indicate.
Oh mom, people take loans from the banks to establish a company or business.
Sitting in the association, me.
He opened a shop on rent.
Something new, like this.
This is a falcon that looked at my eyes, oh my, them for me yesterday and he told me, "It's simple, try them."
He just yesterday took their dealership.
Did you see how
And after they tell me, "Mom, all the merchants love me." "May God make his creation love you, O Lord."
Yes, your long-lived one.
And I'm coming now on the way to the office.
I saw a new supermarket.
They are preparing it.
I really liked it.
I don't know who it belongs to.
Congratulations, congratulations, uncle Sparrow congratulations.
May God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God,
What is he, he comes in as a partner, takes it out cold, cool.
You, you, now can say no.
Okay, what's the story?
What does he usually say, then?
Shower with him
You don't know who his father is.
Who doesn't know his father?
I killed him, I am Qasim, his friend, Abas, told me, "You have nothing to do with the b**s**."
I have a baker, thank God, from whom I earn a living.
No, I don't like the name.
I did not pay attention to it.
No, my brother, the name is not beautiful.
Okay, here's a suitable name for I
I found it on Grand Theft Auto.
Qasim, we'll call him by a different name, a Grand Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Assalamu Alaikum
Peace, mercy of Allah, oh long-lived one.
Excellent, excellent, it's missing something from you, do you want something?
Thank God, everything is fine.
I say, this is a new employee, very new to us.
She, long live you, but I sent my car for repair, and she came to take my car because she is a representative of advertisements in a marketing company, and she did not take the initiative to get rid of the car.
You might also need your car.
No, absolutely not. I'm not even needing the car today.
Yalla, it's alright.
This is the age of knowledge, learning, and study.
I am with doctor Rashed, a person must be armed in their article, no matter what the article. **Alternative Translation (emphasizing neutrality):** I am aligned with doctor Rashed. It is essential for an individual to be well-equipped and articulate in their written work, regardless of the subject matter.
Excellent, Doctor Sami.
May your age be long.
Study and what is study.
You are listening to us like dogs.
No lesson, no trade, and no economy.
and he never read a book, even a newspaper, not even once. his hand was never holding paper, not even in his lifetime.
All of you know who the Falcon is today.
Even though I wouldn't mind entering this field of trade, but
His uncle, Bu Nasser, this one, he is alive, well, and present right in front of you.
From the depths of thought / Consciousness.
However, there are people who are naturally born to business. By their very nature, they love business.
Your statement is correct, Doctor.
Return, God willing, O Shaheen, look at your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
Too late
Of course, this depends on upbringing.
You have no need to provide, Doctor.
Mubit, honestly.
How did a hawk mean in this ease with which he used to hate trade, that he reached this great sense of economic awareness?
The one today, if a hundred billionaires were to pass him, they would pass the one, and he would be one of them.
Do you know, Abu Saqr?
She chose a falcon for the Knight of the Souk.
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser?
I got a call from Mohammed, and he told me that Bounasser was ordered to be admitted to the hospital.
He told me once that you are aware that Saqr, the son of Bu Saqr, wants to take over the car dealership from his father.
The agency has flown away from you.
Really, one's world is never enough.
The father is the one who helped him to enter the market.
This is what made him open his eyes to trade.
To be honest, the doctor says his condition is very difficult.
That's not going to happen like this.
Nothing is impossible.
Shocked, or supported, it's not my concern. I'm telling you to divorce her, divorce her, I mean divorce her.
In such a way in the twenty-first century
And we meet, dear viewers, with one of the men of goodness and giving in this country.
A man who knew the path of truth, for the السائل and the محروم.
Of course, we have the founder and owner of the Falcon of Goodness Association.
Of course, if you address us, Your Highness, about this association.
We all know your noble goals that you strive to reach, of course to the world and of course to everyone.
Without any hypocrisy, or pretense, or desire for fame, God forbid, I mean...
Thank God, Lord of the worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty livestock to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds, we prepare for delivery.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
Mashallah, oh long-lived, may God increase the number of your likes.
We left the house, me and the missus.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: بس المدام بتمر نص ساعه تتفتتح مشروعها الجديد
And I am waiting for her.
No problem.
Really, I love birthdays so much. I love counting them with you, it makes me so happy.
And I provided for my children.
All my life.
It seems like you want to waste my time.
And further from the problems.
Bake the bread, the bread of Har.
Yalla, O people!
In such a way in the twenty-first century
In such a way in the twenty-first century
Those who want to dive, diving requires effort.
He wants men.
The Souq Waqif thrives.
You deserve it, you deserve it. Congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you.
Mashallah, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from God.
I just wanted to say a word, but you'd say "okay" / "done".
On the occasion of his license, tomorrow my son Shaheen will go to the agency and choose the most beautiful and expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The air blew upon us from the slopes of the valley.
Oh love, love has entered, take me to my homeland.
Hi Fadi
Any news, Anoud?
No, no, no, no, no
Now you're telling me the dress will be ready after a week? Send me your last message, telling me it will be ready after ten days, you fool.
You want him to have crystal, and he wants to take some, and more.
God willing, now I'll chat about things with Alnood and ignore me.
Why are there some lights, we have some.
Oh no, don't be upset, the whole world and the stubborn one won't be upset.
"Get angry again, oh Fadi!" "They rose up, envying you."
Oh my, how wonderful their words are! I want to be like them, not like our community. I want to be with you.
The important thing is, don't forget me, the topic.
My dress is ready.
Here you go, Fadi.
Thanked, my brother Fadi.
Here's the translation of the provided text: **"Hey, Fadi, do you have a week for me? I'll take the dress, okay? Goodbye."**
How did I initiate to serve you?
Just send me the dress home.
No, I didn't like it.
I went to the store today, it's by Fadi. The work is excellent, and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were successful in this project.
I am becoming later.
Uncle Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong with him?
Look at the envy.
We have never heard of a shower in this bankrupt project, where will the money come from?
Her face is swollen, she is sucking.
And the first thing I started in trade.
Are you sure?
Listen to my words.
And God willing, are you intending to remain silent about it?
Seven in the morning.
They will bring you breakfast.
Don't يسلم (it), I'm just kidding.
Just I wanted you for a word.
I heard you...
I intend to dive into a commercial project.
But I'm somewhere else and these conversations, where, may God guide you, young cousin?
Fashion design for women, what design for example?
Who are you to tell me?
I am a finance person/professional.
No, no, no, no, but I.
Do you want advice? I am ready. If you want, I can help you with something.
Thank you, thank you, oh cousin, thank you.
Please forgive me, God, I'm leaving.
Here you go, Uncle.
Or is it the first time you've told me if you want more?
Yalla, Fadi, get your act together! The store is a mess, I can barely find anything in here.
The shop is not enough.
You didn't say you would take the place I told you to take. Come on, trust in God and take it.
I wish.
This shop, the one I told you about, is a merchant.
Is there someone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Sayfi, other than your cousin Bu Nasser?
No, there isn't.
I am from the Ministry of Economy, I saw his name in a transaction with one of his friends, named Essam, who is in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
I am sure.
I see the lease agreement and it is written on it.
What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? She has a bad appearance.
Has your sick heart tiring you?
My successful project dried up.
I said, "Don't ruin it for him."
This is an open market for all.
Sh Sh Bu Nasser
What does this say?
And I check your pulse, I tell you what they are saying, I tell you you intend to open a project.
I didn't lie to you.
And seek help in fulfilling your needs through secrecy.
May your sixty years be a disaster for you and your things.
But don't let it get to you.
This is everyone's provision; everyone will take their allotment.
Your hand extends upon me.
May peace be upon you. You are welcome.
Lalala, he really went too far, Abu Saleh.
Get your hands off my mother.
Open to all
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
I am a woman, and ask me.
Know our women well or they will die in Lebanese dialect.
Madam, this is expensive for you, no no, this this, there is none like it in Doha, at all.
Yes, madam, it suits you well. This is a beautiful dress and those lovely earrings. And that bag, it's worth thousands of euros.
He is like him.
The year I brought in the Lebanese carpenter, I did my best to suppress the news.
Madam, I will make you a closet that has nothing like it in Doha, completely.
You will succeed.
What exactly is the matter?
Why don't you find out?
The customer's secret means
What do you think, man, let's move to another place?
Ava, Ava, oh redeemer.
They play, truly with their souls, at that very moment.
It means we lost, no.
I must confront it.
And we bring our customers back, by force if necessary.
Okay, do you have the means to pay?
I won't pay then.
Ready to do anything.
But the important thing is not to be overcome.
Here is the translation of the provided text: This is the dress that you, sir, chose. It turned out to be worth sixty thousand rials.
Surely, without the existing textual links.
Here is a gift from the designer.
Here is the translation of the provided text: **And he put a single crystal bead, there isn't another like it, out of the fifty available in the entire world, this is a distinguished and unique bead.**
Definitely no discount. Our prices are global and well-known.
No, for sure no, who would do that anyway?
Hold on, hold on, madam, what's going on, what happened?
Give us, O Saad, give us.
This is something they do.
Slaughter us, we have no more customers, at all.
Haidi is a war name, oh Abu Nasser.
And we are not silent towards them.
We must fight them as they fight us, and return to them.
Tomorrow I will take a selfie from the bank.
And you ignited the war against them, and I will show you them.
He didn't bring it, Abu Nasser.
Look at the advertisement.
Look at the advertisement she posted.
We have two evening gowns for free with each wedding dress.
He is wearing four different evening dresses, along with a wedding dress for each.
And we have a one-quarter page advertisement.
Goofy is a one-page comic.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
Do you believe it, oh Um Nasser?
They have not had a customer in their shop for six days, with only one customer entering.
And today, Al-Asr, I will tell you, they have not opened even once, they have closed.
And if you haven't heard that his place is for sale.
By slaughtering it, by slaughtering it.
Not even able to sit, sat outside.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text: **"Okay, drink Jake, and go to him."**
Here's the translation of the provided text: "Here I am, God, guide me. Where am I going? Where is this problem?"
You are someone against whom something is done.
This is, thank God, someone intentionally mistaking the store for this scent.
Here are some chemical substances.
Are you sure someone is secretly spraying air fresheners in the store?
You are older cousins, not younger ones. You bicker like children.
Oh, night, and there's a bad smell in the shop, I mean, that's fair.
I didn't bribe, this is your smell.
On error
You have written on yourself a pledge to the police.
I don't care.
I am this time
He is prepared, with a hellish plan.
No one can hold anything against me.
I swear, everything is normal.
What is this that is puzzling me?
I don't know what's happening, by God, this is the fourth day that no customer has entered our shop.
Where are you? The first place, you made me reveal my face, may God guide you.
What did the doctor say?
I see the store empty, not a single customer or visitor.
I don't know, you'd say they cast a spell on him.
The women and girls do not approach the store at all.
What are you saying, you've been doing magic, turning the designer Saad, a monster.
It's not far-fetched, don't rule anything out these days.
Magic exists, and so did that afterwards.
Is he well now, resting or sitting?
Go inside to him, my brother, go. I'm afraid the ceiling will collapse.
You lost, O Sultan, you lost.
I don't know, maybe a donkey made it.
Other than him, it is a monster.
Calm yourself, my brother, so I don't bother you in your life.
I don't know what he did.
Teach me, my love, what you did to him. They tell you, "His friends gathered to listen to him, give him money, and pay off his debts."
The designer who has it.
Lebanese
You told him, you told him.
You don't know where he went.
The stars, the stars, the stars are there, and these are the background actors, their role, their role.
Call the real (person) again, maybe he has a circumstance.
Hey, Ahmed, man.
Hey, Mr. Ahmed, you're sitting here and leaving the mending shop to these two, making a mess for me, you know, what should they do, or what should they not do? Where is the supporting cast that you said you would bring today?
And get away from me, it's better for you. I called him and my head hurts, even asking Mr. Abdullah.
First, don't shout because we are actors and we want to be relaxed a little, we want to focus on our roles. Second, the man called more than once in front of me, calm down.
Shut up, shut up, shut up. What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh master Abdullah, what should I do? This is my torn destiny, it will end with the scene fading and a new beginning for me.
Yalla, oh guys, yalla, oh beautiful ones, who's next, who's next.
Yes yes yes, oh professor, we want to finish, but these background actors who are supposed to film the scene afterwards, why aren't they...
Don't want anyone to shank you like this.
Do your job quietly and without shouting.
And this is our situation, all screaming from morning wanting to concentrate.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think? Take care of yourself in a scene like this until God willing, I'll bring you a representative to perform the role correctly.
Is it really what he will work on, one scene?
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Just go in and take a picture, sorry.
But if you are not ready, today I will cancel everything.
On the roof, come on.
What do you care about a single Filipino working?
You don't know about Bu Walid, he'll break it immediately and tell you he wants someone who looks like they work at the cabaret, someone who is from the cabarets and a Qatari.
My sir, we will wear it as a ghutra, and a high one, it will not be visible, meaning.
Alaa, are you serious? You want... you're just saying random things. This is eggshells, this is a production. Respect your father's feelings, respect people's intelligence.
You now, Alaa has put everything on your head. Divide the tasks, you will rest.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"Listen, so I can learn to think. My thoughts are with me, Rae. Maybe you remember someone from our group like this."**
Who is it?
Remember, praise and give thanks to one person in the "strongman" village, named Saud Alkanar.
Saud Akenar, that's it.
Saudi's words are like censors.
The poor man is in pain, he wants a rich man with prestige, my bones are knocking.
My love, he is finally a background actor, meaning he gets a supporting role usually given to a wealthy and well-connected individual. This perceived wealth and influence allows him to offer a "common" role, which is a form of patronage.
But a little bit of makeup, oh Remy, and you wear a bisht and a clean thobe, and a fancy car.
May God grant it benefit.
How will we reach him then?
I am leading their house.
Assalamu Alaikum
Happy to
Which of these is a boy?
Yes, yes, yes, here, here.
Yes, he is grateful, yes, father, you didn't fall short.
Now how, oh mother, is there nothing but this white garment that came for the one who brought me, my uncle from traveling.
Dad, all you have is that one you wear.
Dad, I'm inside the closet, under my clothes.
The group, oh my, are waiting for me by the door, complaining.
God, God, grant you success, oh father.
I mean today I will find you and they will film you for television.
Here's the translation of the provided text: **"Yeah, Mom, and they said that they're taking me out, meaning on TV, that I'm one of the big ones."**
Sit down, you dog.
Come, you Ash, this is spitting on you.
Spray, spray.
He attacked, oh my.
Quickly, oh mom, thank goodness now.
God willing, father.
God willing, God willing, but they will give you vouchers.
May God grant you success, God willing.
Oh God, pray for me.
I brought you سعود the biscuit, سعود the laptop.
Assalamu Alaikum
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
This is not Aboud, son of Fatima Aboud.
هلا هلا
Sawad Hal
This is what will do the scene.
Okay, here is the translation of the text, without any added explanations: "Alright, God willing, God willing, he will do a good role, I will stay back and oh I will make them give you a longer role, okay?"
Tell my mother how she is.
It's not that kind of thing that was caught on the first camera.
Shame, shame. Erak, Ahee, Su'ood.
You started wearing glasses.
The master was greyed.
And I don't change, I regret nominating you.
The brother whom we are holding so that he may act as Abu Abdul Aziz's father.
Hey, hello, welcome, oh, yeah, هلا والله, oh, yeah, هلا
The face turned white, this is our exit, Professor Ghafl, the persistent.
The most important thing is that you are not afraid of the camera.
My brother, I fear no one but the Lord.
Don't worry, relax, and listen to his instructions. Whatever he tells you, the director will say it, God willing.
Brother, brother, please, you are going to play the role of someone from the high society, someone from the rich class, do you understand, or do you not understand?
Come, boy, come, boy.
I am talking to you.
This is very light, the role needs a heavy one.
Everything is acceptable from some people.
Ask me why I talk like this.
Dad, these are the people we hired for the photography. Listen, I'm going to take you now to the makeup room and I'm going to train you for the role.
Shame, shame, shame.
Come, please.
We got to know her.
Stop stop stop, you you
Here you are, I brought you. Please, come in.
My teacher, the car you want is for the scene, it's ready.
Saud is cleaning everything, he is adjusting.
Any flaw, let's reschedule it after a second, and the assistant director here to listen to you and go reassure them.
Imagine yourself as the merchant of oud.
You say this.
Yes, I am telling you to be patient, to not rush, I didn't expect it from you, Abu Abdulaziz, you are Abu Abdulaziz, say
About our rights
Sweet and I know.
Let him, my brother, clean up. Look, his intestines!
Cleaned and completed the full name Bouabdelaziz Falal Marzouq, nice.
Sweet, continue, continue, and consider.
Consider your daughter to be divorced.
Why did you divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced, she is beautiful, she is beautiful.
Wade is very beautiful. Complete it and consider yourself not taken.
Why don't I tell him, yuck to you.
Like hell, I swear to God you are like hell, and you are a حافظة, may God's prayers and peace be upon the Prophet, peace be upon him.
Let's have someone clean my intestines.
How come? What for?
My Lord, the owners of the house are treating us terribly and want the hall "in shreds," as we "jump" the scenes that are "in the hall," and then we "capture" the scenes that are "outside."
How does it mean they don't want?
Yes, they want it, they want it, but it will be delayed a bit. They will shoot a different scene, and we will follow them, God willing.
Leave them, they will come to you.
Assalamu Alaikum
Peace be upon you
May God grant you goodness and long life.
Hey there, who are you, boy?
I am Salim Bushawe, the Shia.
And blessings, and widespread blessings, are well-known.
You deserve it.
He pinched my nose, I went back after they put on the gums here.
Come, my brother, who has a weak nose, now.
I would like myself.
If someone else had done it, they would have died of laughter.
He would like some.
aloo yemma
Dude, my mom is tired. Now I have to go to her ASAP, dude.
It's a fleeting moment, gone in an instant, and you're left with your clothes like this.
I can't tell you, my mother is sick, tired, she tells me.
Listen, you can do this, but when I call you back, you need to return quickly.
And me and him, you know, we really can't collapse the location.
That's it, that's it. I will find a taxi, my brother.
Taxi, you. If you search, here and you sit for a year searc
Do you know this car? We are renting it for real, for the scene.
As long as she is standing, go ahead.
Please, my brother, please, I beg you, give me the medicine, my mother is sick, please, give me the medicine, give me the medicine.
In the car.
I want a chair.
Send me a chair now, send it now, oh Sheikh.

My mother is tired, I swear, she's in the car, she wanted a chair, may God grant you safety.

Yes, yes, oh father, oh father, I become.
Shut up or you'll talk. Just be quiet.
Peace be upon you
There is nothing, but your mother, your aunt, is having an asthma/epilepsy-like crisis. Oh God.
Let them highlight the bed.
Okay, okay
And you don't have to worry at all.
May God hold you accountable, oh what have you done?
Thank God, oh Rashoud.
They finished our son Rashoud.
You are ordered, go ahead with me, Mr. Rashoud.
Here you go, Mr. Rashoud.
And I will take Mr. Rashood and do what is necessary for him.
This is the mammon from you.
I will make the nurse believe the times, and see you drinking something.
Here you go, Mr. Rashoud.
About your nose.
We are only one person and many people are waiting.
The problem is no one is paying attention to us, oh my.
Sir snow wants to leak maybe a coffee cabin
Oh, you're not the first person. I usually take photos of the scribes at the hospital, and I often have a Filipino maid.
And who told you I'm refusing?
None of them paid attention to me.
Shut up and listen. Or, Get a life and stop overthinking everything.
What do you mean by that?
Brother, there's a girl in the hospital that I like.
Hey, don't you have someone else you can go to?
He couldn't, my heart is attached.
Your brother became a doctor and fell in love. Can you believe the one I saw?
I wish this is a serious doctor's consultation.
Here's the trans
Go away.
By God, look at this face.
May your life be long, the aunt is in the best of health.
You are a professional actor, Suood. Alright, guys, next one. Alright.
Oh my, look how they applauded and praised you!
Come on, go change your clothes and wipe off the makeup.

Okay, my love, come on, with safety.

We can only manage.
Let this be the maid's right, for them to eat it.
He wants to make us look ridiculous.

This type is for free classes for high-level people.
About average, roughly.
No, we want something that is not ordinary, something that is not just for anyone to be able to buy.
Forgive the sheikh who doesn't know you, he's ignorant of you. You command, you're long-lived.
Shut up, just shut up. You don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't be ashamed, go withdraw with the card.
Oh my, oh my, oh my, what is this beauty, something classy, by God.
Saleh Mullaaj, yesterday.
Saleh Nasser
Certainly, certainly.
Here she comes to you.
We reserved the small hall and the dining room for a noisy crowd.
Very good
The mother, about whose wedding the Lam said, is from the house of As'id.
Surely everyone will say the same thing.
Isn't that what's scaring me?
My sister, my love.
Just sitting, thinking about money.
Let it flow, dismiss the talk.
He wants to make us look ridiculous.
But it's not supposed to be something we bring that is suitable for us and according to our circumstances.
Did you know that some people borrow money and others have to sell their homes and cars just to afford a lavish wedding and ensure people don't criticize them.
You just get out of the story, and it's enough, it was enough the pocket you wanted to fail in, we failed.
You yourself said that the manager was impressed with the Chinese girl and took her home.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, as a single block of text: Zain Dam Ahl Al Aroos Qalo Intu Ikhtaro Al Salah Wal Kousha Wajhizo Kull Shay Abrul Roohikum
And God willing, you will let us choose anything.
It doesn't mean "anything." I'm saying the place we went to just now, it means its price is very suitable.
Here is the translation of the text: Here is the store that is hosting a wedding for a house with gold.
Someone used it before.
I swear to God, I'm being completely honest for once.
Bint l'Atwil al-'Amr m'Bark.
No, we don't want anything used.
My dad, Koucha. We are the first people in the world to use it.
It means you want to stand out.
Tell me what you have.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English, without any added explanations: This is the tent for the first time, I will enter Qatar.
Inspired by the information السورة, meaning Facebook and Twitter.
Modern and very new.
And what is the price of this setup with the accessories?
Can I calculate it for you, but not from one hundred and twenty-five thousand?
Yima yima, ترا جذي ما بتكفي افلوسنا كل شي ارقى واحسن وتميز ترا هاي كله ايكلف افلوس
All the people did this.
Shut up, and whoever silences you.
What is the error?
What do you like about this?
Here is the tr
At your leisure, both of you are ancient, but a wedding ceremony is a Noah's Ark, which is more expensive by twenty thousand.
Even if, God have mercy on your parents, I say a leather bench is much better, honestly.
Shut up, no, I want a Noah's Ark ship.
Here are the translations: **First part:** "These are the weddings and this is their cost and we consider ourselves to be middle-class people." **Second part:** "These are the weddings and this is their cost and we consider ourselves to be middle-class people."
I mean, you have to book a hall for one hundred and fifty thousand, and a hall for one hundred and fifty, these are the ones you booked, the Royal Hall as you said.
We didn't say it's magic, but what about appearances? Everyone wants to look at the other, and everyone wants to do better than what the other person just did.
The battle of visible advantages, no one benefits from it except owners of wedding shops.
Those who know that everyone wants to be distinguished, exploited, used, and deprived.
By God, I know a friend who says his brother owns a wedding shop.
The tent rental doesn't cost two thousand riyals.
I won't lie, I didn't believe it, by God, he made it happen.
That's it, a boy has acted.
Like others before you from the youth, they got married and behaved.
Welcome to the Sheikha, long may you endure.
What's your news?
I know you love to be distinct.
And that's why I'm calling you.
For the first time, a Qatari design by the world-renowned artist Peter Salasso is being presented.
Its formation was influenced by the nine planets.
From the Solar System.
With a boat, the ark of Noah, something very beautiful comes out.
They will throw me, none of them will ever be you. You will be the first one in Qatar. You will use the nine planets.
That's it, boy.
She was illiterate and fifty thousand, and now
Any way
May God reassure you.
The translation is: **You are most welcome.**
It's a lot of expenses and I'm your brother.
Anyway, I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to arrange all eighty of them.
All I could manage was sixty thousand and twenty thousand, which I took from my brother.
You did not fall short, by God, my brother, oh Fahad.
Gather up, Fahd, gather up. As long as we are, we take pride, and you show up at the wedding, we are in deep trouble.
Manifestations without pride, without boasting.
Surely the cards showing what you want will reach you.
God willing, this week we will start with the cards.
If our wedding isn't better than their wedding.
Yum, my cards! The ones your son is going to make for the wedding.
Where is this brother of yours living?
People now travel to countries just to get wedding invitations.
Aminah's house is not there. They went to Italy. They designed the cards and printed them. And they were happy with Aminah's house.
They went to France, even people who don't have a lot of money, would go to Lebanon, would go to Lebanon and would bring their cards.
After a country like this, you don't want us to be in violation.
Why, and which country do you want to travel to, God willing?
I mean we got many awesome cards.
She is truly expensive, that's for sure.
Just distinctive and no one else like her before us.
My friend is not handsome.
I say gold is better to shine.
Brother, since he can't afford the wedding expenses.
What is the point of him getting involved in the first place?
And we will leave behind this arrogance and display in the wedding and the losses that offer no benefit.
And only these hotels and wedding shops benefit from our mental illness.
There, poor thing, he/she/it is gone.
Let me go deliver it, it's a shame, maybe he won't find anyone to take him.
May your arrival greet you.
You didn't fall short, O Nasser.
Brother, the family of the bride should, after all, stand by you.
I am just once, and that's it.
I mean, it's not necessary to have a huge banquet hall in a fancy hotel.
Here is our daughter, found in the street, and others are not better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at everyone.
And who told you I got married?
At least some people don't have this arrogance.
It's a simple party with expenses as they are.
And then come on, man, these days people have wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheaper and less expensive.
It means you are not married to your children.
Forget where you want me to be.
I don't know.
If my son Abdullah Arweesh does not get married, either to my daughter Nawal or to someone else.
Get lost, she'll do better than me.
I say my love.
"Mrs. Oldg has a number, Arwoushid. Give it to us, and let us call him."
Okay, my dear, you've been more than generous. Alright, goodbye.
We weren't agreeing, Mom, about the DJ. He changed, you changed, it's going well.
And the mother of Nusayr thinks she's better looking than me.
You forgot who she is and who we are.
Those below us will become better than us.
The topic is close to you, it's not like this, but you are looking at my brother Saleh, he breaks my heart, and we don't want to put pressure on him.
He broke my heart.
Greetings
When are you at the hospital? Which hospital?
I don't know, it just suddenly fell on us.
I heard this talk, it almost made us fall.
He has no story, you can't blame her after preparing everything and people knowing he says he doesn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass/hurt us.
What did the doctor say?
He's letting us down, my sister, he's cancelling the wedding.
God willing, only good things will happen.
Do not burn her heart.
Mother, you are a man, and you are the one who brings the money.
Go, go, blow her heart.
I swear, if I say this, it's true. Abu Yousef's heart would stop.
You know why the minister is keeping Bu Yousef until now.
By the way, I think it should be "He is retired for three or four years," I don't know.
Nothing is wrong, he is helping me.
For God's sake, you are not sober.
You understood that I am fed up with it from now on.
And let him submit the papers and documents until you recover the money.
This is what they call a significant cooling delay.
Jan, I didn't speak, I don't know why, why, I mean, are you afraid?
There is nothing wrong with it, and then I, I, in the end I will return the amount.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The engaged, disciplined person.
My uncle, my uncle. I tried, but there's no other way.
I gave you the YOWWA following the audit.
And their case is with God in the audit, unlike anyone who quickly, quickly.
Eat slowly, eat slowly, eat slowly.
I ate the whole grain, I ate it.
No, God willing, from 7:30 AM we will be in the hall to welcome the guests.
No, we will be there.
I will give my son a wedding, it will be the talk of Doha.
Surprise
Okay, my dear Fatima, I will call you back.
I'm scared for you, my son. They will envy you if you enter their company. Tomorrow, that's how it will be, in the suit.
Oh my, how handsome he is in the coat!
The police are coming.
May He make it good.
Shh, police, you, stay here, I, I am with you.
Allah is sufficient for me against you, O Slooh.
Your marriage is over.
The husband's cage, we posted earlier, the prison cage.
They discovered the papers I hid for the loan. Hey, come on now, it hit them in the head and they caught me.
And why are you bothering yourself?
You hear worse things than this.
What should I say?
Respected, loyal employee.
He loves his work. The ministry contracted with a company to perform maintenance.
The employee, out of his eagerness for his work, went and asked about the materials.
He found her for 400,000 Ariyal.
It saves the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
The minister will go, he will punish him, no no, he didn't believe this talk.
And why wouldn't you believe it?
This is Ahwa Saad, he arrived.
Definitely he has the complete news.
Fire him.
What's happening in the world? Where are the values?
Doesn't he tell you to call the director of his office?
And he said, "Let's build a dam instead of a pool for Uthman."
Who is this after?
The daughter of the director of the same company that his daughter offered as a maintenance offer.
And those whom Othman revealed.
No way, no way, no way!
You're all surprised, Saleh.
This appears to be a
Who has
This is how we became.
What are you saying?
This employee, poor Othman, what is his fault?
His crime is that he is an honest and loyal employee.
The manager is rumored to be in his office now.
Any of the things that came out yesterday.
What's wrong with the world?
We engulfed strange shapes.
I am with you, Othman, he does not deserve it, but there is nothing I can do.
May his age be long, he has seven children and no passport.
Hider, hider, his age, in this job now, where will he hit his head, where will he go?
Did you see what happened?
The new employee that the minister appointed.
The office of Uthman, and I stayed with Uthman, a poor man who wanted to take his things, and I forbade him. She told him to go, and she would send for his things with the maid.
Where is he now
The scales have been turned, O Othman.
This is the end.
He will do what God has decreed.
Greetings to God.
God is generous, O Othman. God will not abandon you, God willing. Goodbye.
I hope there's no bad news, your voice sounds unnatural.
I know, I know, you are very sensitive.
Here's the translation of the provided text: "Which shift, I swear I have no energy to work. That's it, I'm out."
And his chance is still coming for my mother, and I will go get the things for you.
I'm back, I don't want you to stay like this, annoyed.
What's wrong with you, shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I am not screaming, I am asking.
What is normal, oh my, is it right that you are riding with him, with the husband, with the father, with the brother?
The world has changed, where are you living?
I don't know, mom.
You are not sober.
People have been liberated. The universe has become a small village. Where do you live?
But I will say.
Be two-faced and live the time, don't be late in catching up.
Unload the groceries quickly, come on, are you going to keep talking, you're just staring, come on, close it properly.
May there not be a problem, oh Saleh, what is wrong with you?
You are not normal today.
And so I yelled at the maid, who had done nothing wrong.
He came back, you know, even though it was against my will, I swear.
I have no desire.
In order to forget the troubles I've experienced.
My love, there is nothing like it.
Dad, are you a little bit angry today?
Something that delights us, long may your age be.
Thank you, thank you, you did not fall short.
And to work hard, diligently, and persistently.
Correct, oh peace.
The most important thing
The most important thing to me in this ministry.
Correct, Your Highness.
Tell me what's wrong with an employee who isn't corrupt?
It is of no use.
For this reason, I want you all.
There is no place for us here for the devoted, principles, and values that are outdated.
If I one day discover
Let no one blame but himself.
We do not shy away from the truth, even if it brings blame upon us.
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
Even if you doubt it.
Inform me immediately.
Theft and the children of thieves, and our sisters, of course, they have no shortage.
Noura, if one single day you don't take a bribe, you steal from the government as it's leaving, heading towards the house.
Mashallah mashallah, well done, this is what you are expected to do, all of you, I don't want it, but it is for all of you, I want you all to do the same thing.
May God bless you.
In order of this, I want you to leave the Purchasing Department and become a personal assistant.
Honestly, I knew you chose well. You picked the right thief in the right place.
That's it, oh Um Aswad, that's it, don't make me more tortured.
I didn't send you to prison.
But Allah is sufficient for me against Satan, he is the one who tempted me and made the trustworthiness seem good to me.
And he told me to become a trustworthy person.
You are a real scoundrel.
What happened to the trust in honesty and loyalty?
You have always lived a free life, a thief, and you are comfortable.
May you indeed have become noble.
Let me talk to your father.
Deal with it, do it again.
One walks, his master is bribed, he steals, he hypocrisizes, he lives comfortably.
My father is imprisoned because all of his money is الحرام.
Stop stop
This is a dress you are wearing.
We are a respectable family.
It's not a defect for you.
Where are the oranges?
Why isn't it exposed?
Aren't you ashamed? You have no shame and no الحياء.
I'm ashamed to wear my brother's clothes.
A woman is ashamed these days.
What's wrong with you, shouting?
Gawfi, what are you wearing?
A respectable woman wearing this form.
God willing, you will walk in the street without anything showing from your body.
She wanted to be with her, but she wouldn't listen.
Otherwise, I am not neglecting her.
Oh, get her those see-through clothes that don't require any special occasion.
Be careful, if I see you and it's not a day when you are wearing something below the knee.
He who warned has excused himself.
We are, thank God for your safety, coming.
God willing, but just games and sarcasm.
He went after his father.
You will see it in front of you.
Good, honestly, where do we find someone like him?
I don't care, uncle, I am black, yes.
And yes, the Real is honest. Frankly, my daughter Sarah, I cherish her deeply, and her well-being is of utmost concern to me.
Don't they mean they've heard of her?
Thank God, what God has willed, I heard it was bad.
I enter the house at 3:30 AM.
Oh my God, God has willed it. It's five in the morning.
Yes, yes, what is the matter?
Come, take me from the bar.
Get your car started and come take me from the bar.
Oh, it's the first time I've seen a father who doesn't listen to his son's words.
Yalla, yeb, about the movements, work your motor, yalla, I'll wait for you.
My love, I love you.
i love you too i am already disappeared disappeared disappeared
Basically, basically, my father, my father is here.
Where is it?
My grandfather isn't like my father, a mess he can't give.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Malek.
Oh Abdulaziz, that boy friend from before?
Come on in, have a seat, it's a great opportunity.
And the Arab and Israeli artificial satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians didn't know how to cut their nails.
According to what the State of Palestine committed to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Generally, the United Nations meets today to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the fingertips of the Palestinian people.
If their nails are long or not.
There was a condition, which was that there should be nothing in Palestine that would irritate, wound, or draw blood.
The State of Palestine.
I invite the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Agreement on a Comprehensive Peace
We make it from cork.
And the olives, man.
We press the olives like this, like this, we press the olives.
We, and our Arab brothers, demand the international community.
By conducting inspection teams on the fingernails of Palestinians.
And now we begin the voting.
No, it doesn't reach that level, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Saleh, Saleh, what's wrong with you?
I dreamt of something.
I dreamed of a world turned upside down.
O Rashid, I must tell you that you need to have a strong personality.
Now, my brother, this school where I will be attending tomorrow, what number is it?
I am like you, a teacher.
Why didn't I change my school since I started teaching?
Which character, my brother?
But the problem is that his personality is weak.
By the way, the teachers who work with him are the ones who protested against him.
Has it come to this, brother?
We don't see him being quiet.
After he started explaining.
It's not even responding, it's just mayonnaise with...
My brother, we are not telling you this to make you upset.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text you provided: **"We are telling you this because, finally, this is the last chance."**
He told me, "I accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak."
And shaken, and very good, more than necessary.
Whatever, this is a boy of the country.
Why are you silent, my brother, now?
Because all the things you said are true.
All of your words are correct.
From tomorrow.
Mr. Rashid, the new one.
Mr. Rashid
May God grant you good health.
Forget it.
And from tomorrow
What kind of justice is this, and then?
Here I am, telling you.
I am a teacher who doesn't like mistakes.
It was excessive for me to tell you, "like the boy told you in primary school, while the inspector was sitting."
Okay, here is
Ash, ash, you broke the door.
That's it, one has learned from their mistakes.
From the very first minute.
Here I am, telling you.
I am nervous.
How am I
Shut up, well.
He said "Shut up, it's good."
Did you hear it?
Rashid told me he kicked me out.
Ava, Jannah, said "Oh my goodness, it's good, but it's not ideal, I don't want to see your face here, you're in the queue."
teacher, I don't know who this boy is.
He was born of...
There is a teacher, Rashid, coming.
Here what passed near you.
If a student says something to their father, it's a problem.
Okay, you're asking for a translation of the following text, presented as a single string: "انزين انتوا عاده ف الفرصه وين اجوفونه متفرص قاعد" **Translation:** "So, you are usually at the opportunity, where can we find him taking advantage, sitting?"
One can find him near the chairs, sitting down.
On the chairs.
The chairs, the chairs, the...
And man, ultimately, is human, meaning
But you screamed at me.
Quarter and act silly. Make me act silly.
My dad is traveling and will be back next week. If he comes back, I will tell him.
Oh, Abdul Rahman, and whoever brings you safely.
We are a quarter of a T-R-A-S-C-R-E-M. The Tulip Icecream is very sweet. You might not have tried it. In some places, it is a delicacy. It is truly wonderful.
Come on, go get it quickly.
All I'm afraid of is that he will tell the truth about his father.
You didn't say that his father was traveling.
O you traveler, it's not the father's will, it's finished, the father's will, meaning they packed their belongings and told him to send him away.
God help us, and may God have mercy.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English, as requested: "I'm taking his bag and bringing it to him. I'm also giving him your phone number in case you need anything. Call me, I'm your friend."
Okay.
Just what
You are the ones who told me.
Shout and rub your nose, you are strong.
The bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom.
Rashid
Lie down, you. Lie down, lie down, no worries, lie down.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Nasser is in the bathroom.
One juice and
Come, come, come, come. Give me.
Let's go quickly.
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I brought you all so I could hear your ideas for the concert.
Someone will ensure it.
Ball came, sweeter, making us problems. This is him, connected.
Three o'clock
Hey, sugar, you're joking, right?
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you
Inspector stands, inspectors sit.
Yes, that's it.
Hey professor, come here, here boy, hey professor.
That's enough to upset him.
I'm not joking, man. I'm asking you, are you finished talking?
Did you finish it or not? Where is the teacher's dignity? You are humiliating yourself. You are insulting the profession of teaching.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Zain Zain khalas khalas
You raise your voice even more.
I raise my voice, you are the first to know this boy, his parents.
Faster, faster.
Two cars.
No, I am Arab, I want four, four, five cars, go, go, go.
To be the owner of this thousand families.
Abu Nasser used to do this and used to do this.
May God make it easy for him.
I am the manager here.
Originally known as Bonaser.
He was giving all the teachers extra lessons.
except me
Who is the manager here?
You are the manager, may God protect you. What's wrong with you?
Reel it down.
I put it on your head while you're sitting on the chair, my brother.
Shh, what does it mean?
There is no need, I swear, I swear, it's me, honestly, I want to comfort you.
What is it?
You are in the end with me now.
Respect yourself, it's better for you, and you'll get extra lessons, whether you like it or not. If you agreed, that's how it is.
Then with you, stand up, stand up, get out!
God willing, we will be out soon.
How are you, we told you, oh son of people.
I must stop him at his limit.
Hold on, everyone, hold on.
I don't blame us, Abu Salem.
Oh Bu Najeeb, you are the elder of the neighborhood, and I must stop him from crossing the line.
I am not someone's son of a.
I, I will show you what I am.
Hurry, hurry!
Goodbye, may your age be long.
What God has willed, when after buying this new car?
You are the one who didn't believe me.
The mustache grew, and his face became red.
I swear to you, the day a storm hit us, I didn't recognize it. The day she started talking, I recognized her by her voice.
You know that since last week, they've been mistreating us.
It means he is responsible for eight schools, for boys and girls.
What a magical secret, it tells you what the secret is that you pulled from the bottom.
Here I am, telling you from the first day.
And while I am explaining, I cannot hear any sound.
and we don't name
Respect yourself.
After he replied to me, he hesitated, whether to leave or to stay. "Oh God, either way."
As soon as your appointment as a minister is announced, immediately find me a good job you have.
Come on, that's it, I won't tell you to come and take this job.
Or so-and-so, no grandpa, just give me choices, like different job functions, and I'll choose the job that's the most suitable.
My brother is a minister.
By God, I really couldn't rest from the calls that kept coming to me.
Mashallah, everyone is congratulating.
They say, "Oh my, may God guide you."
This is a normal job, where every minister does what his friends and his group want, automatically.
Don't worry, you're in good hands. From this side, you can rest assured. Nice to meet you, and I hope you have a safe journey.
We know of course that I will become a minister.
Vulcanized rubber cement
The treasure between us, a treasure opening for us.
The Earth is returning.
Yalla, everyone has gone to congratulate the new minister.
Oh God, oh God, oh God.
Congratulations on the minister's appointment.
May your age be blessed, congratulations.
Congratulations, Minister, you deserve it.
You deserve it, O minister.
O brothers, the responsibility is great. God willing, we will be able to carry it.
And to their saying, a choice that happened to be suitable for its people.
You came out after I told you, "Bo-Saleh's phone rang."
He was a bit far from him.
Never mind him.
What a love that descended upon him all at once.
And Sultan بو is not easy
Yes, I blocked his car door.
bravo upon you, you did not fall short.
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mom, it was you who didn't believe me.
Are you telling me coffee shop talk, coffee shop talk?
After her husband died, his mother told her, "I am the one who supported him."
God protect, God protect.
You have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Come on, get up, let's go, my liver is about to burst, get up!
What do you mean, no one has any business?
Rest easy, you.
I just entered their place, offering because they angered me.
They are right.
But I didn't want to say those words in front of my mother. You know my mother exposes us.
Anything you hear, you publish. They call it the sieve. We don't want scandal.
What are you going to do if they take it away and replace it?
Because I asked.
And if you are removed, you will be the first person to be nominated.
Okay, here is the translation of your input, without any added explanations: **"Okay, here is the translation of your input, without any added explanations:"**
This one, I'm sure of it.
Oh, shame on you, I see his/her hair like I see yours right in front of me now.
Will she do magic for him?
But the plan in my head is guaranteed and effective.
His plan is burning and soaking.
Let him ban all activity that happens in the country.
At that time, he would burn, and when the burning reached him, he would spit, and when he spit, the garment would fall.
By God, my brother, I don't know how, I don't know what to tell you.
This is what you called it, "participation" that reflects how much you love the country.
You mean you see it like this?
You are today a statesman, you must be in the picture.
I must contribute to everything. Forgiveness is a long process, my lord. Forgiveness, forgiveness.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
What's with you, long-lived one? This is a simple sheep, you mean it's not in your stature? What's with it, what did you say, long-lived one? You're going with me today.
The Real is taking you for granted.
You know, to be honest.
I don't want to go.
I'm fed up, fed up with the bragging, fed up.
You are a minister today. He has amended his statement and as he told you, you are a social personality. Take good care of yourself.
God, make this good Saudi Riyal for you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I cannot imagine me.
Give him, give him.
Today I took him to an evening and a wedding. If he isn't clapped, we'll clap him with broad beans, a picture.
I'm also bringing you a nice job. I want you to take it.
Listen, I have arranged for you an excellent educational activity.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: This is how, let it shine. I want it to shine, shine, shine until it polishes. I will look for this shine.

He doesn't know him.
National Participation
Remember God.
This is the fourth time one of my friends has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities. Umm Khaled calls you the social media activist, the moving one.
Yesterday I heard a word that hurt me.
Yesterday was the day Bosultan took me to.
Bids for the victory of the sprouts in swimming.
Someone is sitting and telling a friend the truth.
They think I don't hear them.
He says this minister.
My father bought a birthday gift for my nephew's son.
هلا هلا
I will be inside a newspaper every day, Dad.
Right right
This is what, you come here and you find nothing, light, you want to know
Hopefully, you will pay money, not pay money, no problem.
This is an informal, colloquial expression. A direct translation that
I am I am Bu Salih, the minister.
Bosultan didn't come to take me to a place I'm waiting for.
And he seated me in the first row and went to his car to rest.
I don't want anything from him. I rely on God to guide us.
Come on, you old woman, and whoever يرحم والديج (merges parents' god) show up, my hearing, I will speak a little while to address you so I can be certain.
And from yourself, you started calling.
People are sitting down for us to give discounts.
I told you I am.
It's very beautiful.
This thing, it leads me.
O minister, O seeker, O this our God, O O O, O O.
Here we are, minister.
No, by God, I am tired a little today and
Okay, if you can channel this enthusiasm, go ahead.
You are welcome, but my brother Saad will take you, and he will search for you, God willing, so that he finds a celebration for you.
Okay, here is
No, today we have no activity.
I swear there isn't.
Where can we find a child?
Thank you, thank you.
I say there is no one we can ask.
May God's spirit grant you success.
Tell you to go to sleep and rest.
Lahdha Saad
Anything, God willing, we will.
Yes
This appears to be a
This is just a piece of wood in the cabin. It's only a picture, and it's empty, ready to be closed. It's like a piece of paper in someone's face, but it's just a picture.
Yalla, good, yalla, with farewell.
What have you done to him?
I have no idea if there's a match in the reserves league. God willing, I'll be there on the field.
What is this? This minister has decided for us.
Sweet means it reached the peak.
Here's the translation of the Arabic text
May your life be long, he became more famous than you now.
May your life be long; if you go somewhere and take Bawhalis with you,
Your Majesty.
Shining star
We turn it off by returning it to its normal volume.
The minister arrived, the minister arrived.
I do not imagine, I do not imagine, by God if one of you captures me, I will not break you, I will not go down.
Brooke broke the cameras, there's no point in taking photos.
I thanked you a lot.
And as they say, I missed the train.
This is Khaloud, my brother.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Why is it like this?
This is the first time I have seen it.
First time I've seen it.
First time I've seen him in years.
Wow
This is a Khalouadi.
It's been a long time since I saw him. Come, my love, to me. Come.
What should we do with it? I'm used to it.
Ugh, there is no power or strength except in Allah. You responded to the same topic.
Get out, I'll tell you. Get out or sit there, making my head swell, for I am already returning from the wedding, it is three in the morning.
Just let me rest, this isn't a story.
Your brother built it.
I swear to God, I will tell the truth about my father. What have you done to yourself? You've become like a little girl.
He was playing, playing.
Whoever was playing, I'll tell you, was wearing Goth makeup and was playing with it.
As for this, it's Suud. I know what to do with him.
Khaloud returned, and oh, how I wish everyone was like him.
For all these advertisements and nonsense that he brings forth against his brother.
Yalla habaybi, ta'alou sallimu.
Here are my beloved, how are you?
I don't know, maybe they're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Fahoood from Kuwait.
Hi, Hamada.
Listen to me.
There is no power or strength except with Allah the Exalted, the Mighty.
Let my love's hope be the one who chooses.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say what's on the beach is sweeter.
Will Lane in the near future. We bought a yacht to go out from the house to the beach all the time.
We and our children.
Come on, just set a date for the wedding.
That's it, it's almost over. A whole year and a few months are left.
What is this, your brother is wearing a lot of perfume.
Honestly, I haven't noticed Khaled, your brother, I don't know how.
But everything is different from your brother Saad.
He returned, either not returned at all, or returned, but not as a non-returned entity. Everyone, my life, is free to act as they wish.
Then, this is your fiancee, a retard who doesn't know that there are fragrances for both sexes.
I say, let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself.
I don't care.
Khaled didn't believe it.
You are not just someone who uses perfumes like women.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khaled?
Oh, really? You don't have a life?
Oh my, why don't you want to look for something about him that you can't see with your own eyes?
This is the time for perfumes, for the two.
You heard me, it's as if I warned you.
You saw the Bluetooth.
Listen, the quarter, they are talking, in the meeting, they are saying that it is widespread in Doha.
I heard about him, Rawanna.
You find out later, I'll tell you.
Oh my God, look how she dances!
The provided text is an Arabic
These are the girls of Joff, this one who says she dances well and does movements, you know this one, this is Khalود, son of Amr's uncle.
Kholoud's money, my cousin's son, the dog.
But here I will show you what's in it.
He awaited his brother Saad.
Why did he let him come, and I will show him. Why did he let him come, Saad will send him the Bluetooth so that he can show them.
Assalamu Alaikum
Hello, welcome.
Defeated, for sure.
What's wrong, cousin? I see him sitting far away.
I can't, but I'll tell you: your Bluetooth is open.
I will text you something.
Thank you, Sheikha.
Shut up, run away from his family.
You are a happy person, O Saad.
Yesterday and traveling tomorrow.
I will not show my face in the country.
Where do I strike your head? Where do I strike your head?
What will people say?
They are saying their son, who spoiled them, traveled, and you want to create a scandal for us.
Greetings
What you did, Khalid, for your son, this is a source of pride and honor.
A real, long, never quite fat, shame.
I have no interest in what those who said 'This is the brother of my daughters' were saying.
Tell them to travel, to be treated, to study, to work, to commit suicide, or to do anything else.
It is important that I do not live in a place where shame is a constant pursuit.
Where did you go back to?
I will be sent to sixty below zero.
This is the end of it.
That one, we don't know where its lands are, and this one, he makes his bags, he will travel.
Even we don't know where he wants to go.
Ashkenti, I expect you to know what will happen.
What's wrong with you now? I brought you home so you could rest and be cared for. You cut yourself off from me, from my words that hurt my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Do not let him become a servant's property.
You wouldn't have known about it, and her.
My father is preoccupied with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mom.
It means there is no hope, just for the sake of your sister.
In this case, you are right.
What he did, immortality, made us all, what we have, between people.
I am not able to see anyone.
You killed something.
This is my father's biggest mistake.
We are in a case of the perverse and vile Khaloud.
I did not kill him.
To a CD and give it to him.
Here I am, going to the airport.
Very afraid for him.
Our house must reach this point, oh Amal.
Do not be surprised.
Kholoud and people like him, I don't accuse them based on people's reputation about their families.
Its brothers and sisters heard it.
No matter how much religious values call to them.
And they will go and dance and revel.
To the drain of evil.
I swear to God, Dad is really confusing me.
Goodbye, father.
Take care of yourself, father.
Really, I have a simple gift for you, Dad.
A gift for me.
Now, someone has put the CD in the laptop. I am scared about what is going to happen. Walk with me.
Yallah, yemma.
Believe it, Mom. Dad is still watching the CD; it's its entire duration of three minutes.
The following could be extracted:
Where does he go, where can he reach, where can he go?
How are you, Abu Saad?
Dad
I'm sorry, Amal.
And if I search, I get tired and my hands ache.
To find someone and throw their morals.
But forgive me.
May God grant you success.
I say, I look for you, you went out on the roof.
my love
We are in an age of freedoms.
The age of human rights, and nothing is limited for us.
He who has a riyal, takes a thousand, oh my sight.
Of course, that's such an amazing statement. May God protect America, my dear.
He is the most honorable, the one on whom is bestowed a generous gift.
Malum, one thousand two hundred.
God is sufficient for me against you, and you are the one who stands with the car owner, asking him how much his salary is.
Mom, I'm not made of money. I have many jobs.
He who finds me sits and complains about a slightly low salary with no real benefit. We're fed up with him, his 700 dimes. Take the liscense and add another 800 dimes. Afterwards,
I killed him, it's been a year, I'll increase your salary.
This one looks like a greedy person who will cause us trouble.
Just get out, just get out, just get out, you just get out,
Is that word easy for you?
You make him pity me, I hated riding with him in the car.
That's it, leave it to him.
You've now told me the story. I'm the one at home, I'm going to insist. Shut up, you too,
Get out, I want you outside.
Come, stand.
What does he say? You.
He says, "My friend, you don't see him, he's inside, he's in emigration, he says one thing or another."
This is my father, there's no friend here, there's an uncle's money, me and my brother, the brother of our uncle, the father of our money.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Tomorrow, it will be five minutes past noon, God willing, and there will be a roof."
Five minutes.
Leave it inside the mind of the one who is good.
You are not a true woman, as everyone is saying there is
Everything within the world is easy, but precious.
After some months, it will be eight hundred.
Dad, I am having a problem inside the country.
This is a driver inside a box in a pile, one thousand, one hundred, two hundred.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **In bad, one can wander in bad three hundred above the wealth of one thousand, a father.**
Patience, I will not give up on my thoughts.
Look, I will get more and I will give some water, that's it, that's it, be quiet, there is no more increase.
You are not good for talking, one hundred is more than enough, go do work.
Say, friend.
I said I would, you.
And a hundred, there is no benefit.
Two hundred, it's of no use.
Shashi, I am in fear.
Not Kouf
Everything revolves, create a story.
May the roof of the house of three thousand and four thousand be strong.
We will mess up the inside of a house, there is no use outside, spend money on a horse.
I am very afraid.
This wool, I already know it.
How much is in
الفين five hundred one
There is a fear of this police coming and going, and I am imprisoned.
There is no Covid, you.
I'm fine, my tooth is what you are.
I'll tell you, you're wearing my hat, I'm going out.
I vote for him, no one answers me.
His room's hero, the repression's empty space.
Amnīrah, her maid, for a year, has strayed.
All I can say is, حسبي الله عليه.
Okay, I will visit you.
I went to the police and reported it.
Okay, since you have reported, you have no further responsibility.
We, God willing, will not be remiss.
And you too, look around the neighborhood, from here to there, maybe you'll see him, respond, let us know.
He who collects money and is satisfied, goes and turns himself in.
I bring them, I lose them, I wear them, I eat them, training their cars.
Not according to his whim.
The match will start now, come in, good.
We were indeed scared, I will tell you.
These are the Fox team and the Fox team doesn't easily reach its goal.
Do you know if he scored more than three with its meanings we did not win we want ten fifteen
Open and obvious ridicule. Open and obvious ridicule. Let's be completely frank. Open and obvious ridicule.
If this level does not bring in more than three, it is not a Foxes team.
Tell you it, take it.
"In the self, in the game, and in the performance."
He has nothing to be thankful for, if they release a person with less than three, they should be thankful for that.
Here's the translation of the provided text: **Original:** اي قول هاي مقبلات فريقنا لين الحين يوعانين هذا فريق الثعالب وخر عنا يبه هم **Translation:** Yes, say these are our team's appetizers until now, they are suffering. This is the Fox team, get lost from us, oh dad, they are.
You scored a goal comfortably, you enjoyed it now.
I expect there might be more sayings, or it might just be that.
This is a bad and good thing. This is in your mind. Go away from me. There is no good. You are in the role of capital. You are this bad thing that eats chicken.
No, I don't have a car.
You are a friend to me.
You didn't hear what he was saying.
They say this is a very troublesome fox.
You are in God, there is no one who can.
Yes, sir.
You don't know him or what?
This is the crazy talk of the free foxes.
He sometimes appears in a talk show.
He will defeat you today, you will be defeated.
By God, you are a formidable team. There is no defeat, everything is victorious.
What do you say about the result today? الترجمة: What do you say about the result today?
What does this show in terms of a result?
This class has foxes in it.
This bird comes to take the livelihood of what it does, it is a bird.
Let us, let us be realistic to some extent, I mean, by God, do not tell me that the foxes won and flew away.
This is my بابا's foxes.
This is a fox taking a chicken to make a meal.
Oh, long live you! You haven't seen him here in the stands, what is he doing?
The audience is slaughtered from laughter.
Zaher is inside, wearing a suit, and you are not.
He is the true fan, meaning he has genuine loyalty to the club.
This guy is hanging out with the big Qataris who go to the malls and stuff like that.
Walled invited me for a cappuccino.
Look at the world, my brother.
This guy turned out to be a con man who took five hundred riyals from my eyes and paid the bill.
Heard me the poem that I made about our game against the frogs.
Salama, the attendees, Arabs, from the tribe.
You are a frog.
You are not worthy of a team that is mine. You turn against me, the one you raised.
Clap clap the club and the team see what happens.
There is no saying.
The day one of the foxes was chased away.
What is the reason for
The two of them returned, one as a third of a team.
I made this gaming name from hack, so be it.
His safety, his safety, his safety. Of the Arb tribe, a tribe. These are the Hاذرين.
Every month we meet to select the perfect fan.
Mashallah, and who did you choose this month, God willing, for the honoring?
The members of the board of directors of the association are the ones who decide.
He's not their master, and each one of you is the size of a camel.
From the management of this big club, The fox.
Hey hey, the empty space in the car that ran away from us, we're putting it on TV, hey!
Now this is it
This one is talking properly, that one is just messing around.
Pen or else, his tooth has hurt him, he says you.
But now I know how to reach him.
Oh God, get the audience out!
Turn around.
He turned around from me.
He is speeding.
We lost it now it's good.
Sweet
You shut up, I don't decide, you, I am the real estate agent, I am the one who decides.
We cut off doubt with certainty.

God protect.
يمه يمه انا يمه
Now your father, what will he do to us? It's not known.
I didn't mean it, Mom.
Please mom, don't tell my dad.
Your father will turn the house over our heads.
Definitely, he will slaughter you now.
Yima wallah ana mab kasarha bil a'mala.
Okay, here is the translation, as requested: Zain, mom, why don't we go? I'll bring glue and stick it.
We will stick it to her, oh mother.
Where can I find one like her? I don't know, your uncle, from where did he get it? He got it as a gift.
I am truly afraid for you from him.
Yum, I'm afraid my dad will beat me.
He slammed the door shut until he could find a solution to this topic.
Go quickly, go to your room.
my uncle my uncle my uncle you are my uncle
My uncle broke the vase, my uncle.
Oh my, Walid didn't come to you.
No, oh my mother, what calamities have befallen you?
He ran away from home, oh how scared he is of his father.
This is a very old and poetic style
Oh my mother, this is not proper upbringing, may God guide you.
What should I do now, mom?
I don't know how to act.
I don't know, but I'm worried about him with cars on the street.
God protect him, God willing. I say, maybe he went to the store, or he went to the neighbors' house to play with the kids.
Yes, I love him, his little brother is cute and good, and loved, oh mother.
No, oh my, seek refuge from Satan, or you're making things up. God willing, nothing but good will happen.
Yallah, yamma, with salamah.
Where is his son?
My father will beat me.
My hand, my father, he will slaughter me from the beating.
Don't be afraid, oh apple of my eye.
Don't be afraid, my love.
I am not the one who let him reach out to you.
Against my will, you were broken.
Come, father, come. Drink something for me, my mother, and rest in my room.
Your face is turning yellow.
May God grant him success, but God grant him success, come, oh mother, come.
Oh God, oh Creator.
I am afraid my father will come here.
Just father, don't worry.
No one will interfere in the upbringing of my son.
This is my son and I am raising him in the way I see fit.
But it's a shame, the boy is trembling, shaking, terrified of something he didn't do. Go away, father.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
The door will open.
The bag hit the vase accidentally, I swear he didn't mean to.
You, you have to defend him.
You haven't told him anything for my sake. I forgive him this time. The boy breaks the heart from fear.
Where is he, where is he now, what's making him sit with you at this hour?
Here we don't have it.
Is there any where?
Shower inside.
No, I will take it to my brother's place today.
Okay, well, if he marries someone other than the primary one.
Let's shoot, brother. We want to play.
And your mother says they are sitting and studying.
Dad, just this one game, and then we'll go study.
Why don't you have an exam tomorrow?
yes father
That's it, Dad, go. Don't ruin it for us.
Go father, that's enough. Don't make a big deal out of it. Go, go father. We're getting up, studying, getting up.
What is this, what kind of talk is this, g g g, look!
If you haven't done it, you'll see me calling to tell you, especially Bu Walid.
No, don't say it in front of my uncle, don't say it in front of my uncle, don't.
I am not to be blamed by you.
I tell him, you are not listening to anything.
Okay, here is the translation, based on the
That's it, Dad, put your phone back in your pocket. We're going to study, Dad, that's it, don't say anything to my uncle.
By God, oh my, I'm confused, not knowing how to act.
I'm afraid if he finds out, he'll create a problem for us.
He will definitely ask me why I took him to the hospital.
Okay, here is the translation
If he finds out that Walid Aibou is bleeding on his bed, he will slaughter him.
Oh my mother, here he is, the whole reason is from him.
Oh mom, this is in a psychological area.
The boy is not young anymore, he is twelve years old.
It's okay, oh mom.
At the time, lunch was with us, and then I, oh mother, would glimpse something for him.
This is
Her mother is going to Bahrain to buy abayas.
Oh my, something and something.
And good times and a desire.
He urinates every night in his bed.
I, my children, Abul, every night in his bed, and you are not telling me the story.
He said, "I must take him to the hospital so they can treat him."
Her original self didn't even have a story.
And nothing will escape them.
His words are correct.
Mom, we have to take him to the hospital so they can see what's wrong.
He is looking for a straight, well-fitting, dry hose.
The alley is full of people until the last person in the neighborhood hears the screams.
Sit down.
Eat, oh my mother, eat.
I won't say anything.
I would like a shower as soon as possible. And I will go and bring you some clothes. Come on.
I am
I must teach them a lesson.
Do not interfere.
This is what they call success.
And immortality, forty-nine out of fifty.
This is a success.
But their signs are good.
I told them, "Oh, woe to you if you do not achieve fifty out of fifty."
Please don't send them to your brother.
They must be taught a lesson.
These are my children.
That's it, I swear, I swear, last time.
Why don't you bring fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Add it, one more.
I would tell him not to go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital, they admitted us. He told them, "You shouldn't come, this is none of your business."
You are going to be different, either you go with us.
Just bring a donkey, I will bring my brothers.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: خلاص عمي بموت اه خلاص خلاص خلاص خلاص بموت عمي اخر مره خلاص
Let me teach you, come on.
Be careful, this is not the way to do what is in their minds at the end of the year. If one of you does not get fifty.
Roughly, the swimming pool.
With its head oiled.
Where are your cravings? Where are your cravings?
They told us tomorrow.
Khaled Aboudah
Good, Khaled, well done.
Faisal Abdullah Rashed
Excellent, Faisal.
May God bless you.
Mashallah, you are smart. You are second in the class.
Here's the translation of the text, presented as a single block of
Professor Ahoua is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get fifty out of fifty.
You, my son, I am not speaking to you.
Call, call, call his classmate who is with him in class.
He says, "I saw him at the school's door."
Call, call Amj, he might be going to his grandmother's house.
No, I will not.
Where did this one go? Where did it disappear to?
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Dude, what's going on with this kid?
Here's the translation of the provided text, without any additional explanations: "Here, a boy, he must be a failure, and he is afraid of his family."
Any worthless person, may God guide you, you only have a son who is excelling and is second in his class.
But he is afraid to go to their house.
Because it's only two degrees short, it's in mathematics.
May God have mercy on him.

Waleed Waleed
Come, Walid.
Forty-eight and nine make a total of fifty-seven. Subtract three for a total of fifty-four. I have no information for you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
And nuclear energy
That constitutes sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leads the global reserve with a percentage of twenty-four percent.
Then Libya, The United States, Nigeria.
Three percent each, then the rest of the world, totaling fifteen percent.
and then
As well as from production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the intense competition over this region and its countries, from the major industrialized nations.
And led by it is the United States of America, the first consumer of energy in the world, primarily oil.
However, oil prices have been on a continuous upward trend.
And simultaneous with the downward roleal of the US Dollar
The one taken as a unit for pricing oil.
Where the price of a barrel reached yesterday.
This led to an increase in the revenues of the producing countries, and at the same time
To increase its inflation.
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
On the prices of life and goods.
and that was in a direct interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
abdullah bin hamad al-otaiba
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's numbers and phones.
Welcome, Member.
I would like to start with you from the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
To where can prices go?
"Obviously, to where can prices go is a perplexing question."
or also called the market force
Not OPEC
And it is not the producer countries.
And it is not the producing countries that are the producing countries; it is OPEC that does not have a relationship with the pricing of oil.
Is it just the relationship between price, between supply and demand?
And not now, even the offer and demand, it doesn't... it doesn't have a big influence.
What are the factors if...
Other factors, in addition to supply and demand.
For investors.
They felt very great pressures and turned to oil and gold or what is called commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And the gold as well.
Raaina, Raaina the gold has risen from three hundred fifty dollars in recent years to a current value of nine hundred seventy.
Or until today, as I mentioned, it's about one hundred and nine dollars.
But it's all in the excess, and if it drops, it drops lightly.
May I remind you that in the first quarter of this year...
What is, is the second quarter of what *should* be. *Should* see its prices fall due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in an exciting and astonishingly variable situation.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But what does that mean? That previous factors that used to determine the high prices for the winter and consumption have changed now and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
I spoke about the political factors and I said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Do you expect Iran to resign, in light of the political complexities?
Her companion, and today, she dominated most of the headlines of American and global press, which could influence oil prices.
Here it is, just the translation: "Beh bel maya ay ay elyom ay"
Today we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Unreal factors can influence.
They create some disorder in the market.
And also, a kind of political rumor was created.
He said there is no plan, but he did not deny fueling other options, which could also be carried out for Iran.
The pungent always reacts with the markets.
"Tab'an al'aan laysa hunaka mu'akkad an 'America 'ala harb 'ala Iran."
And I am one of those people who say the word "this" does not mean "to see this scenario."
The Falun will be, and there may be that which we have not seen. What will it be like in the future?
But we who work in the sector of the tyrant.
We see that all these tensions are political.
**Oil supplies in the world**
And on the contrary, there are very comfortable supplies.
What does it indicate that there is oil going to storage?
There is no scarcity of oil supplies at all.
Perhaps ready for the next war.
Under this reassuring picture you speak of the supply, and that there are no impediments to the supply.
In the event that President George W. Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan,
This is something else
Prices rise to record levels.
The price of oil might reach...
Amid the world's oil reserves.
Here, this is here, for today, the Gulf represents the most.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries.
They represent today more than sixty percent of the oil reserves, therefore what is sure.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates
Meaning that if any war were to break out on Iran, the oil prices could not be guaranteed, to what extent they could reach.
God knows best, and it might arrive today. We arrived without it.
Wars to a hundred and seven dollars and a hundred and ten dollars, and it may jump to a hundred and ten, God knows best.
Today oil, as I told you, lives under psychological and political tensions.
Tensions and speculators, who detached themselves from these tensions, increased.
Only his investment in oil.
Or, as is called, not an investor, of course a real investment, no, here is the future purchase, or the future marketing.
It is called oil paper.
This is all speculation in paper on oil.
All his production is approximately three hundred thousand barrels, either exactly that or less.
Here's the translation, as requested: **Translation:** "These people might push others to buy more, which in turn could lead to further increases."
I hope April is just an April Fool's joke.
I hope that there will not be...
Jenny is coming to the area and is said to have this on her main agenda.
My translation is: **My translation is: جيلي هو صاحب هذا المشروع كما قال الكثير من السياسيين و الاعلاميين**
I didn't know what was in Jilai's bag.
And I cannot imagine what it will mean.
Will he ignite a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
Why doesn't the son do anything else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. April is very close, only weeks away, and we will enter April.
And the world may pay.
And America is a major consumer country.
In the Gulf countries.
The Gulf will be the difficult number.
You cannot call this number.
The cost of production is cheap.
Comparison to West African nations, most of which
The Gulf cannot be dominated by any other country in the world.
We have seen and heard this talk from the West and from the United States for many long years.
It is highly advisable.
to its end, the Caspian Sea war, you remember the story, and
Whatever these the dreams
When you sit with the close ones in a closed circle.
You hear them speaking in a different way.
They are saying.
Regarding supplies, the importance of the region, and the significance of precautions.
When I asked a European official, I said it was strange that you speak among yourselves in the Hajj, in the closed rooms.
In a way that you don't usually speak in front of.
The media said no, these are for political reasons.
And of course, there's what's called the "bottom standard," or "two," meaning two.
The person whose concern they know, understands that their role is in the Gulf states.
It is important today, for example Qatar, Saudi Arabia.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world.
and enter into
Despite all of this
Commander of the Central District
Launching the war on Iran
Even if by an air war or an air strike, as is said.
Regarding supplies
You are not late, you are very generous.
I do not agree with you. We are not in...
and not with the westerners, we deal with
With America, we deal.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market.
Nadh' means non-renewable energy.
For the sake of putting things in parentheses, for the sake of generosity.
Arab generosity
Here you are, give me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason for the increase in oil.
You, the people of the Gulf, OPEC, and other nations.
You are very generous with the Americans, insisting on adhering to their currency.
You said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
The real price, corresponding to the decline of the dollar, is estimated to be between sixty and seventy.
Okay, now the price is 100.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped thirty-five and thirty percent.
And now it's above water, a hundred dollars.
If we take proportion.
It is not denied.
One of the main reasons for
Compared to the decline of the dollar.
If we take, if we take the
If we take this comparison
The prices of oil
Because the United States of America
Of course, it is in her interest at the present time for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy; the United States cannot produce a list for it.
So, what happened in this weakness and economic recession?
You too have become.
The United States reduces interest rates on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the US dollar?
Let's talk. Why is the price of oil linked to the dollar?
The first one over the water for a hundred years.
The first step, exporting the first barrel of oil exported from the United States of America.
And it was issued in dollars.
It has become since the beginning of the twentieth century until today.
Dollar pricing, oil pricing in dollars.
historically it became
For a hundred years, the entire world has been interacting and pricing.
And which is considered Norway today as the third oil-producing country.
and its source of oil
Russia is the second-largest oil exporter.
And the production of the North Field Sea in Europe.
It is priced in dollars, not priced in
Everything is changing in the world. There are other sources and information that indicate something other than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This statement is not true and there is no
And these agreements
It is based on keeping oil as the cover for the dollar, in exchange for the United States providing protection for these systems.
This is not correct and there are no confidential agreements.
Today we decided not to take the OPEC organization.
You have sixty-six percent of the capacity of the deputy.
From thirteen countries.
From the eighties, forty barrels, an amount equivalent to forty percent of the OPEC quota.
There are many and very large countries in oil production.
Outside the OPEC organization.
What are the obstacles preventing pricing with another currency?
Look, because the price is in another currency.
Not everyone, the elders, when they decide.
You are from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries.
Today is the day for the collective OPEC session.
There is sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There will be an agreement between all oil-exporting nations to
There is no indication or intention to change.
And the attempt, what is it?
But now these countries do not have the ability to change the currency and pricing.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of frequency?
Let me mean speak now meaning Europeans.
Why don't they export their oil?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway, with the Euro or the Ruble.
Because it is in their interest for their currency to be valuable, high, and elevated.
On the contrary, not on the contrary.
Here is their loss.
With one euro, you can import one and a half barrels.
You are the losers, you because your currency has decreased because it is tied to the dollar.
And he is losing too, a very huge loss.
The currencies here in the Gulf have a historical link.
You remember, in the 1970s, the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now you are linked, when you speak of the separation.
This is like marriage, when you marry.
And you bring about the divorce, divorce is not easily achieved.
No here.
Otherwise, you are acting like a Catholic priest with the dollar.
and you must study the costs in a way
To study in a professional manner and to study...
And Kuwait also, having unwound twenty-five percent from its currency, the dollar.
Saudi Arabia Bahrain UAE Qatar
Its exchange rate may be adjusted.
The topic is about the river, but what does that mean? It means that you don't have any intention of studying the topic or thinking about it.
The study differs of course, His Excellency the Prime Minister stated.
Wally stated that in Qatar, the currency is less than its real value by thirty percent.
To enter within this study.
There is no direction, you are alone with this topic.
Kuwait was unique, why don't you follow its lead?
Economists say it is profitable for countries and their peoples. Break even with the loss.
But we are
And nothing else.
The Gulf Cooperation Council states announced these.
All means believer.
And I mean, I'm one of the people who personally support him.
It will support it.
I must be included in this study.
By itself, with its own inherent qualities.
He created what He created, from a state or two, or...
Until the time for work comes.
You will not jump the situation.
This is of course in there, specialists will be studying it.
And they will be they the ones the owners.
This is not the concern of specialists; a political decision is needed.
Let us wait and not be hasty now, look at what will happen today.
People started meaning
Certainly, in a collusive situation.
His efforts, the deputy means, the inflation ratio has reached in Qatar for the year two thousand and seven to fourteen point six percent and will increase to fifteen point six percent in the year.
You take people's salaries and you devour a portion of people's salaries here, the salaries of the workers here.
The residents of Qatar, their wages were eaten by an increase of thirty-five to forty percent.
We will return to you after a short break to find out the extent of the increases that will be made in salaries.
The employees in Qatar, at least during the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to Boundless! In this episode, we are hosting the Vice President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Energy.
Qatari industrialist Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, regarding the increase in enormous prices.
Oil, which has generated tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the Gulf states and other producing countries.
Regarding oil, my question was about the anticipated increase in employee salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has an estimated ninety-seven and eighty-eight thousandths of its total reserve, which amounts to ten billion dollars, and it will lease two and six thousandths of its total capacity.
Only a ton, and the report from the Kuwait Times, an economic report, revenues from Gulf countries are among the largest.
Saudi Arabia's revenues in the year 2008 are expected to be one hundred and ninety billion.
and it was
One hundred and seventy in the past year, the UAE was sixty-six, and this year is expected to be fifty-seven.
Kuwait, sixty-four, and it was fifty-four.
Qatar's twenty-one thousand barrels of oil, not including five and fifty billion.
From the gas, as the other reports say. God forbid, meaning we won't be e
Iraq: 47 billion
One and a half trillion
$1.5 trillion
The Gulf countries imported with one billion, meaning a trillion.
Dollars were multiple imports.
Investment in the United States is three hundred billion.
And nine-tenths of ten billion
There were three percent in Bahrain.
It was in 2007 in Oman at 6:30 AM, which would increase to 7:00 AM. It was in Qatar at 12:55:75 AM, which would increase to 12:55:07 AM. The water level in Qatar was 12:55:07 AM.
يعني من يعيشون في قطر يبشروا بمزيد من الغلاء السلع والاسعار والحياه
Life is being consumed, prices have risen at high rates, and more in Qatar.
We feel all the empathy in the world.
Then their processing must be done.
And processing means it aims to control inflation.
It means your salaries will increase by fifty percent.
They are not saying that you are against raising salaries.
This is not correct and there is a problem.
Prime Minister is against the increase in salaries.
It became clear that there was a problem, and that the solution must be the optimal one.
And there is no solution for the patch.
Okay, there's a balance between the teeth there.
This is a strange
The important thing is here is the processing of inflation.
And here, in Qatar, there is a committee.
Issued by His Highness the Prince, may he be blessed, their formation.
And s
To put it simply, it's about rules.
Strong to solve the problem and control inflation.
The important thing is to control inflation first.
Inflation
Here it is, if you don't control it.
Be the deputy's messenger now.
Specialized in market research, it was published at the end of February, just days ago.
Amidst these, do not enter.
Now you will get stuck on inflation and let inflation devour the incomes of these people.
Many of them are now.
Income to other countries
Increase our salaries, and then perhaps deal with inflation and lower it again.
I am saying the words, the words they say, which is the parallel in the subject.
But now
And it is not a temporary treatment.
The problem increases in a larger way.
Therefore, here.
From trying to limit to from limiting inflation.
Boredom will always
Because the increase was enormous within the past year, within the previous year. Correct.
The second point, the second point.
And those working with the government are different from those working with the private sector.
Private obedience is completely neglected.
The current issue of excess is something that should be looked at fairly as well.
I don't know where you got the "you" from. These are notes or did you bring something else?
We live in Qatar, not Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
The most part
A large number of Qatari citizens who were working in the government sector have transitioned to the private sector.
Due to the large salaries.
He faces a problem.
You are moving to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic.
And gives good salaries.
We are linking what is called the market force.
Or, with the strength of the market.
They do not come, and they are highly specialized.
They will not come to Qatar because Qatar is the least, the least meaning in terms of salaries or less, in terms of costs.
Or, with the costs, they come.
Okay, with our complete understanding.
I am not, I am not, anticipating events, nor am I saying that there is an increase in salaries.
Also, there is no hope, I mean.
To control this inflation.
Let's give it some time.
To control this inflation.
"And God willing, this is what it says: 'The report states that Qatar...' The year is 2008.'"
God willing, it means we will.
We see that these numbers will approximate.
They sprayed something on the people.
It is a process, meaning we will be a professional operation.
Of course with professionalism and everything, but
From inflation.
Because of the spending.
The large one is on the various projects.
Allow me some questions from the viewers, and I hope that each can be asked directly. Abdelaziz Mohamed al-Maghrib: Your question, brother Abdelaziz.
This matter is based on the fact that the ruling families in the Gulf
I do not think that the justifications for that are due to a lack of agreement among OPEC, meaning...
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the ruling family and the rest, it is spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, things will remain as they are.
Peace, and the mercy of God.
May God grant you peace, my brother Ahmad.
I, my brother, will not prolong this conversation. The mention of a brother in the context of the ruling systems and the issue of linking the dollar to the riyal or the riyal or the currencies of the Gulf to the dollar, but
America wants to globalize the world under its banner through it.
The U.S. trade deficit with China and the U.S. has reached $82 billion.
The European Union and he reached sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all directions of global policies are converging against the dollar.
And we are paying the consequences of this now as Arab countries and the oil-producing Gulf countries.
It may end up in a confrontation between America.
And among the leading developed countries, such as China, Russia, and others, the issue may become significant.
Purely military.
The explosion was caused by Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and even American bombs.
Thank you very much for this clarification and this information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Welcome. Your question
Can you lower the TV volume and ask your question?
Your question
Here's the translation of the provided text: **"However, what I see is that the deputy's representative is determined to not meet."**
The subject of not being linked to the dollar because the dollar is falling.
And he will descend, God willing, to the lowest depths.
And he is a good man.
It should not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Mr. Mohammed. Thank you. Thank you. A last post by user "AhmedH". ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
May God keep you in goodness.
Thanked and not restricted in the regarding the nice interview.
Salary increase, God willing, things will improve. We, what does he mean? What is meant?
We are correct that we are all facing problems, not from salaries.
Salaries, God willing, things will be good.
Ask your question quickly first.
I'm cutting you off. When you're on the line, do you have a question?
All of it is due to price fluctuations. Fluctuations affect everything, imported goods and all imported goods.
From European countries outside.
Okay, we have all the Arab world, with factories and research centers.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you for taking your time.
Now, the issue of high prices is an important issue.
Waqdiyat al-wuquf ma'a al-ghalaba al-raqel, khallik ma'a al-ghalaba sa'ah al-na'ib.
The origin of what concerns what one does not have, a billion here, is that the poor are numerous.
Here, it means that "us", "of the", "brothers", "means of course".
Those who do not know Qatar.
This is not correct for the state of Qatar.
The day that comes to Qatar, let's see what the indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth rates in the world
Shake the sword, to where it goes, what will you do with it?
What is in the framework of responding to it?
When he spoke, he meant to request, from the brother in Morocco. He spoke in a way that was, I believe, an exaggeration, a misrepresentation of the facts, or a delusion.
The person who cannot see with their own eyes.
If the person who means "uhuh" comes and sees Qatar, what developments of a very huge magnitude will occur there?
Are you asking if you are growing significantly, yes? ARE YOU ASKING IF YOU ARE GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY, YES?
And everyone has the right.
And you people are this many, how will you find people from where?
Will it really mean, will it, will it be, will it import, will it be a surplus from China, will it be?
We will not import, God willing, and
The state is built on a plan and on...
For the optimum independence of these funds, which come from oil and gas, and everyone is aware that oil and gas will one day end.
To be the state of Qatar.

Today too the
The focus is on
And what will be has the impact.
The large one is after oil and gas.
It means you don't give birth in Dubai, you give birth elsewhere.
Every country, every country, every country has its characteristics, every country has its own characteristics.
We are in the State of Qatar and we focused on education.
On the foundations
Here, here is a medical city in Bayhs. People can perhaps trust and relate here.
It will be a media city that will host...
Of course, today is World Mental Health Day, and today we must build...
We are building a perception.
About the post-oil and gas era.
There were fatal errors.
And there was unfortunately, we did not take this advantage because, unfortunately, we got a surprise.
We were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor educationally.
Today I changed after thirty years.
and also the most important thing
Here, today, he went crazy here, imagine.
And vision
And vision
Thank you very much, the deputy's representative. I also thank you, our esteemed viewers.
Thank you for your continued attention, and we hope that we have provided you with...
Qatar's foreign policy appears hazy to many observers.
Van قطر تتمتع بعلاقات مميزه
At the same time that Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it was and still is...
Movement of Islamic Resistance (Hamas)
Qatar presented
It started.
The largest Arab country.
This angered the regime in Egypt.
From Qatar, expressing anger, he crossed the line by accusing it of conspiracy against Egypt.
Also, Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur in Sudan, and the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier as a prisoner.
The Qatari fortresses extended, and the hand of Qatari foreign policy angered the larger Arab nations.
What strength do you put into this place?
Among these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani
or write to us via our website at internet WWW dot aljazeera dot net z
His Excellency the Sheikh, welcome.
September 22, 2007, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It was a landmark visit in the relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Resketching the borders
Washed off what was clinging.
This is what I mentioned.
The newspaper or magazine of the rightists.
Those you held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which marked the beginning of relations and the return of the Saudi ambassador.
To Doha
At the beginning, your introduction was long and somewhat repetitive, requiring many answers without your final question.
I believe his campaign.
Particularly regarding the topic of Saudi Arabia.
What is flour.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is important to Qatar.
Existing between the two countries.
She spoke about silencing Al Jazeera.
I talked about an anti-coup movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted an explanation.
In the state of Qatar.
The dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined to a range.
Viewpoints
By God's grace, and this is by the wisdom of the commanders.
King Abdullah and His Highness Prince
Heavily in the Gulf.
More than a hundred years.
The relationships were always bright and honorable, and relationships of trust.
I want to confine it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This topic was suitable and there were no conditions.
In solving any case.
But there was an understanding and there was a sincere intention from both sides.
To resolve this lingering issue
It is a non-seasonal position, rather a strategic relationship.
We wish for her, not for her to last, but to develop.
Beautiful diplomatic talk.
until Saudi Arabia's withdrawal of its ambassador from Qatar
I am not used to speaking diplomatically, otherwise I would have avoided many of the problems.
I always used to say what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia, and therefore it is not diplomacy but rather a belief.
The topic of the island is included in the topic of media.
Between the two sides, and in many countries that got involved.
In her belief, she might be ignited or she might gain points, earning points at the expense of other nations.
Or, it depends on Qatar.
or on the Saudi rupiah's account
They should resolve the differences that are within the Gulf.
It means, in contrast to what was before.
He knelt due to a political agreement.
No, no, this was not an agreement, only an agreement of affection and an agreement of interest.
Either anything that violates that, this topic is a question that the Al Jazeera administration has asked. Did you build the Al Ula strategy?
The coffee is between you and Saudi Arabia, so that what was before can be avoided.
The relationship was originally built on a close strategy document.
It can be interpreted as one two three four.
And there must be a sense of unity.
And I resolved some of the differences based on this basis.
Between some Arab states, we are working on settling other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, it is essentially differences in points of view.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy regarding a particular issue, and another country has a different opinion.
This is considered two points of view.
I mean, some observers were seeing that you were enjoying criticizing Saudi Arabia.
By directing criticism at her.
Did you get tired and decide to move in a different direction, and then you turned to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
He means the same, the same idea.
No first, we don't derive pleasure and aren't idle.
That we can deal with any other party in this manner.
It means the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Between them, and I know there is an understanding.
very big and you know we established
and there will be some kind of model
But Saudi, but Saudi.
Let me put this under two lines.
You began to exchange accusations with Egypt, with the Al-Ahram newspaper in issue 12, April of last year.
The Official Egyptian Newspaper
The investigation, in a comprehensive review, stated that the extensive investigations
A Hezbollah network uncovered a subversive plot.
Egypt is targeted, with participation from three countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
and Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media trumpet with a fully conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest of the Arab countries.
Conspiring against Egypt.
We respect.
And a struggle throughout the years.
I am not saying it to emotionally manipulate someone.
I will complete what I left incomplete.
We are able.
And the Egyptian president
Caring
on Arab relations
First point.
The topic of Gaza.
As they say, and as we admit.
Qatar is a state.
Its size is smaller.
You can participate in a scheme of this kind.
Because we suffered from state interventions at some point, and I don't want to go back to this.
Who sold the interventions of some countries in the Qatari affair?
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered it, they don't say "conspiracy," meaning...
And also, don't put someone's name, I mean, we, I, want to tell the house, may God protect it. Syria and Iran will defend themselves. I will not defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or take intervention in a matter of this nature?
And the pyramids do not speak from whim.
Qatar's Doyleh sought to undermine Egypt's role and its connections with Turkey and the European Union.
And to hold a parallel conference to the Arab Summit, with less stealing the spotlight.
And while you're using a primitive media trumpet, it
Here you go.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable, Ms. meaning
I am able to tell you with confidence.
This appears
Intervention in such circumstances is not our principle.
What compelled our brothers in Egypt, and that is what we hold the Egyptian officials accountable for.
The existing disagreement or sensitivity among some members of the Egyptian government.
But some officials have a sensitivity.
From what?
I will contact you regarding the matter.
Days of Fowa peace and the Qadeya of peace, and that we
And it was preceded in Egypt.
And after that, it was held with us.
Because Israel
We have a dispute with her.
Do you have a conflict with Israel?
And now, because of the conference and from that day onwards.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they have a sensitivity there.
Why is this allergy?
sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
And we always hope for the best.
This allergy, we have discovered.
Or, or three, meaning.
Gaza conference that happened
Egypt does not want to hold a meeting in Qatar.
This is not Arabic.
In Qatar and I am at a summit in Kuwait, we told them, oh people.
The Palestinian people will march and hit.
More than two weeks.
But we complicated it before a scheduled conference, a pre-programmed conference, the Kuwait conference of which we were the first to ban.
People are killed and...
And with, meaning with procrastination.
The dispute appeared.
Not even a minor country stopped this fighting.
Of course I know that there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone except Egypt.
When they said that after
Okay, are you in the island?
And the Israelis have informed that if it is accepted by the day, then there will be a meeting to stop the fighting before any speech or anything.
what is
My brother, they brought in medicine and food during the time our brothers were being hit.
They used to say the gate is narrow.
I don't understand
They used to tell us that, by God, there was an agreement on the other side, and we absolutely had to go.
Now is not the time for us to want to bring about victory or to bring about Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas. What we cared about were the million and a half million, six hundred, that we were observing.
And they have no medications.
When we started talking about this topic and talking at the Gaza conference.
And Qatar's involvement in the matter causes sensitivity within the system in Egypt.
It is not interference.
We didn't discuss how Egypt is handling the situation, as this is within Egypt's competence.
One of the officials said, "We discovered a big conspiracy behind the matter."
He still hasn't told us what this whole conspiracy is.
That we mean this official.
He tells us that Egypt is a great thing.
Okay, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a major power.
Therefore, we always request a great power many things.
Because Egypt is for us
And you invited them to a conference that also contained provocation for them.
We were not invited to a conference.
The trans
And we coordinated, and our position was unified.
People suffer in Gaza.
Forbidden means I know that Turkey has brought things in through Israel.
I, I, rejoice if I see her enter it through our brothers in Egypt.
From us and for us
And if you are insistent, you will either triumph or achieve a good political act.
This we believe is in our interest in Qatar and the interest of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If she does a good job, it is important for us.
Let me finish for you. Your question and your introduction took 15 minutes.
The case you are now wasting, but...
No, I will tell you, I will tell you, now I mean from anger.
Out of the anger of the officials in the Egyptian system, you must...
We are the ones who failed the Doha Summit.
The second thing is that they did not fail the Doha conference.
King Abdullah has a ruling, as he wants.
He wants to do his own thing.
Therefore, some countries enter what is prohibited.
This is a statement I made to our brother in Saudi Arabia because we were...
We have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, even on this point.
The sharpness, for it appears in internal forms.
Or, or, does anyone among the officials have it?
To the highest officials.
A large country, one person is responsible in it and he can consider that a small country, workers are doing these works.
It means there it was for you.
It is an N. It performs any role.
Darfur is a part of Egypt's national security, and also for Sudan.
Examine the five major countries and...
If any country other than Qatar was possible.
However, allergies are this that lead to an increase in the matter. Why do you put your nose in everything that is near you?
We want to get rid of allergies. We take medication, antihistamines. They tell us what an allergy is.
Why is it sensitive?
Some brothers are in the government.
They want, they have internal failure.
They want to draw attention, meaning it's a conspiracy in Gaza, a coup.
It means, as they say the British, "Absolutely, That's Italian."
The easier it is.
A recipient for not just instructions, but also for analytics.
Here's the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: It is known what happened.
The issue must be addressed locally.
Don't treat.
No, by God, my priority is my country.
My priority, my priority, is to do the first thing, by looking at the issues that matter to my country.
And then consider if I have the time.
Consider fragments that concern my Arabic nation.
And if Qatar tried to fix it...
And to think about every Arabic issue that you can contribute to, to the best of our abilities.
Why are you being provoking? Why don't you take it with good faith?
I cannot treat you.
I am able to express my opinion.
Don't throw it at me.
And we, we, we, in our opinion
That which emanated from his heart.
Let me finish for you.
When he announced the peace initiative and the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we took this as good news, and I issued a statement welcoming this development.
In dictation.
Of course, the Egyptian official who demonstrated his heroics.
In his article, in his opinion, I believe he had a TV interview or something. I will not be responding to it.
Because I have a response to every point.
But I, in order to maintain the minimum threshold of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests.
And also a response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But all I advise is right here and others.
And they try to fix their mistakes, whether internally or externally.
In politics, economics, or anything else, just as we have errors in political and economic matters, etc., there is no one who is infallible from mistakes.
Because they, in their house, accuse Qatar with these accusations.
You deny a relationship between Qatar and anything related to the Hezbollah cell.
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations, undermine its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union.
What we, first we are few in number.
If we are able to fulfill this role.
This is not correct speech.
Accusations are being made against you personally.
To pay money to the occupiers of Shalit, so that Qatar can take possession of Shalit, and it and others can bid on the Egyptian role in the matter.
He always accuses us, saying we paid first. We didn't pay any money, and we didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this case.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"We, by our will, have decided to support Egypt until such time as a solution to the issue between Egypt and Sudan is found, provided that the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is respected."**
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"Ah, so you're saying that President Mahmoud Abbas will remain in office until such time as a resolution to this issue is found."**
We were present and the first to support the state of Qatar.
The authority remains with the Palestinian institutions until the dispute is resolved.
And we said, "Here."
In the Arab League, he says no. We passed it because we believe that there are people who do not want this topic.
But we got away with it.
Does he address his superior?
His Prime Minister
Brother, I don't know what "in" is, there's a problem.
From us, from them, I don't know.
They decided now on April 12th, last year, Al-Sharq newspaper exclusively published the news.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news satellite to counter the media trumpet called Al Jazeera Channel, and to put an end to...
Everything is just days away, the matters will end, and the
Do you fear it? Al Jazeera will become something from the past.
I mean now, a political adolescence, living.
You also conceded to Saudi Arabia, with the Emir of Qatar sitting with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not make concessions, nor did they make concessions for us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small state was being conceded to the larger state of Egypt.
No, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, at an important point to clarify.
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia differ.
Okay, here is the
Qatar's relations with Egypt.
And we rely on it a lot.
Let me be frank with you about this abandonment.
Any disagreement is in the main policy.
Joe, because we don't have a personal conflict. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you now solved two problems: Gaza and what else?
This is an issue, meaning it greatly affected us.
We want to address this from a psychological perspective, meaning we solve this problem.
It was published in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Prince Saud al-Faisal is present.
We spoke about everything.
But it's clear that things had escalated and were unresolved.
No, no, there was there was no, see.
I mean, I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt...
They have some blame, and they are right for us as brothers.
And we have some blame, which they have a right to from us as brothers, youngsters.
We in the great country do not want to compare ourselves to any other great country.
I mean, Egypt is bigger than what's expected.
It is not an issue of life and death, I mean it, but for a solution to come from heaven.
For us, if someone is waiting to be satisfied,
Or does someone wait for a style?
Qatar has...
You treat it differently than treating it as an equal or a brother.
As a major country, yes we are proud of Egypt as a major country.
But if someone is misleading someone.
I mean, this is what I know: Israel follows it with us.
And although U and also Y, as well as the previous American administration, whether for or against me.
I don't think they want to imitate neither Israel nor America in this topic.
And then they mean, if we take any policies, they are also pressured by external parties.
There are several small, small, small pieces that are making me want to continue for you.
What are we, do we understand and know that even though there is distance, there are dictatures that come even to the major power.
The dress moves you in your policy.
We don't have any movement, our movement is just one thing.
The Interior Ministry of Qatar has the right to handle its internal affairs.
And in any area we can assist in, the Arab world, we assist in.
What are the sources of power, Al Jazeera channel and Al Adeed base?
You can say this is not strong.
Our faith in God and our confidence in ourselves.
Or, a vision of His Highness the Prince.
We don't want any clashes.
Let me finish for you, I won't... I won't... I want to create an atmosphere.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
Let them say what they say. Qatar the Great or otherwise.
But we have our point of view.
First, we expelled A and S from the Israeli office.
Glory be to Allah. They used to say, "Close the office." We closed the office. They got angry and went to tell the Americans, "Look at these people."
They went and stood with the ones they call the devil's team.
What are they saying?
To the Americans and to the Europeans, these are our friends and we know how to deal with them.
The intrigues.
Which were exerted
I mean shame, we reached a stage, and in the end, what? **The translation is:** I mean shame, we reached a stage, and in the end, what?
Now, initially.
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt, one two points?
And based on the fact that Egypt has a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe that it is important to look at it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew.
He needs to leave.
The filling of the public opinion, Egyptian governmental or otherwise, or its direction, with trivialities.
And focusing on the interests of Egypt and the Arab world.
are there any steps
We are behind them, not in front of them, behind them because they are a major power.
In the foreseeable future.
By God, I mean, I think, I mean, this topic, I cannot imagine how this topic will become.
And I know that there will come a time for reason.
And a time comes when, whether from among us...
If it was me
Or from their place/side.
Their are significant shared Arab interests.
We will find one day that this topic
It means the world is still far away.
It means we won't swear using the Egyptian style that you have.
If someone extends a hand to us, we will stretch out our arm to a meter.
الآن معالي الشيخ
It means we have never gotten used to running.
We are ready to run to Egypt, provided it is on a sound basis.
We stand with Egypt.
Currently, there are many rumors about the damage to Egyptians working in Qatar due to this topic.
And that there are contracts for Egyptians working in positions, whether in universities or major companies.
Are you aware that in this topic, first, it is not a trait of Qatar to cancel jobs and cancel...
Because these are people who have no involvement in what is happening.
This is a market where there is a change in demand, with some being canceled and others arriving.
He is an offer and a request, and in other nationalities, they lightened in increased nationalities.
Okay, here's the answer quickly.
The office was there.
We worried the office, meaning it should be left now.
We tickled them during the days when they were waging a campaign, an all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
Here we closed it, let them solve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And they were among them, and it is our custom to invite all the accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
It was not a formal invitation to honor Qabirilla Shel.
No, by God, we have not been honored before him when relations were as they say, "good," so I would honor them. Now it's a bit difficult.
There is currently no reason to reopen the office during this period.
The office opens if the reasons are negated.
You are the one who enlarged it.
Approximately the size of Egypt.
Egypt is the one who imposed this.
Our relationship with America is strategic relations. Let me be and convince you with you.
In some matters, and these.
The most important things, eh.
in matters in our region in treatment of some issues we were different with the former administration
Now, the truth is, we have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe that there is great hope that this administration
Serious about moving the peace process, serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
All our friends, and this is what we deny.
What is happening in Iran, what is its impact on the Gulf and on you?
This is a topic that the Iranians decide, how do they solve their issues.
Among themselves
By their usual methods, and I am sure their importance will overcome this crisis.
The stability of Iran, as mentioned by His Highness the Prince.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we are with Iran, sharing common borders.
"Tab'an ehna ayyikun 'indana 'alaqat mumayyiza ma'a kulli jiranina wa min zaminahum Iran."
Because we are a state that strives for peace and stability in this region.
And we were intervening whenever there was a party that wanted to change or replace the Doha agreement.
And I think that Mr. Saad Al-Hariri said.
Now it's over, the strategic talk between the two presidents is what remains.
And among the Lebanese groups
How to see
Regarding Yemen, will you play a role, or have the Yemenis taken a stance against you?
Look first, we are known for supporting the unity when almost all the Arab world was against the Yemeni Unity.
We are the only Arab country that stood with the Gulf countries, alongside Yemeni unity.
And regarding the south, we have spoken with Yemen. And I, as sent by His Highness the Prince, was twice sent to meet with the esteemed President of Yemen.
I explained to him that our goal is stability in Yemen, because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
He did not respect this agreement, and I do not want to say any... each party, what did he do?
But what really hurt me...
That the Qatar that stood by this position is accused of paying money to the Houthis, and from high-ranking officials.
Yemenis because we do not interfere in these affairs.
He who stands with the unity does not stand against it.
And for another purpose, for the benefit of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
This is a topic we have no objection to, but the truth is I was shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting. His Highness the Prince sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
This accusation is strange/bizarre.
The time is up, but to conclude very briefly, will these issues that I warned you about from your efforts to solve problems will these issues change your policy of intervention in other Arab problems?
By God, if His Highness the Prince were to listen to my advice, it would be that there is no need.
and he offered us once a large amount
More than five billion dollars at that time, meaning if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion, which is better than a headache.
I will just tell her while believing because perhaps the time is now in the Arab world.
What allows in these conditions?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency Sheikh.
And perhaps even the exceptional one with His Highness Sheikh Hamad.
For what transpired from an agreement in Doha.
How did the Doha miracle happen?
Approving the committee's authorization and giving it all support.
Regarding Lebanon, after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
When there was Arab consensus
And we went to New York. We were able to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we have touched upon this in Doha, as both parties were keen.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or not to have there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality of the situation and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
And he believed that it was a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I believe the problem of Lebanon is that the regional atmosphere directly reflects on it.
Whether they are peaceful or non-peaceful.
Lebanon was destined for this location.
It cannot be so.
And unfortunately
With external rebounds.
I can say the problem between the Lebanese, even if there is a problem that isn't the number one problem.
Here's the translation of the provided text into English: "Regarding this Sheikh, I know. Perhaps the time is not now, too early, even to discuss the behind-the-scenes aspects, but..."
What happened, you came here.
You have, so to speak, stopped the ground engagement.
You were not even a moment late, meaning
What exactly was happening? I know very well, even the symbols. The leaders of Lebanon at that time were telling me what had happened.
No, I was from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
If we came to Lebanon, kill him.
I am presenting this idea, it is His Highness the Prince, the hand and support.
They will be present there, all the Lebanese leadership.
Because you are here in Beirut, I look at everyone in their region.
And you are present in the same hotel and in the same location.
And on the same plane, you met and spoke.
So we created this atmosphere, but it was always our idea.
And this was the most important decision, the most important.
Of course, there were (some)..
This is something I felt from the Arab League.
We will be impartial intermediaries.
And I think, thank God, that this proved to everyone that Qatar made an effort.
Both sides
To reach a mutually acceptable solution for both parties.
And there will not be a solution, there is no loser.
Before you take your step.
He consulted at the Arab League and found support.
We did what we did.
And I told him, and we are there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha.
And he instructed me to...
annoy them, take away their phones
We were able to bring them there, and also for the brothers in Syria who were supportive of the situation.
And I told you from the beginning, if it weren't for the Arab support, the committee wouldn't be able to do anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred.
This tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
There are several surrounding cases around the Arab world.
And every time we extinguish a fire,
He is a benefit to the Arab world, preventing external interventions and fostering development.
And I will try as much as possible that there is.
He is sending troops.
Even if militarily.
In a case like this, I believe it is a topic.
At the point, Sheikh.
He always used to say, "Solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file."
Saudi-Syrian agreement
If it's Qaf, Qaf, then it's either "If it sounds like Qaf or Qaf Arab, it means Qatar and the Arab League."
هل ان ما حصل في لبنان يمكن ان يؤدي الى اصلاح ذات البين بشكل جدي بين المملكه العربيه السعوديه وسوريا
Throughout the Arab world, we need to review ourselves.
Because of the Arab disputes.
And any agreement between two Arab states
And this we tried.
In the war of 1973.
When the Arabs agree to solve an issue.
I think this is in our interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
The two parties
They overcome wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we in the Arab world are facing enormous and huge challenges.
Everyone plays in our yard.
And we have no power or strength.
And how do we stop playing in the courtyard of the Arab world?
As Arabs, at least at the minimum level of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
We are spectators.
Arabic disagreement and lack of trust among Arabs; trust is lost between Arab nations.
And then the Arab countries.
The translation is not possible to determine without more context for the "نوع من ال" phrase.
What is a galusi? What do you call a galusi?
This is an issue that requires a stand from everyone, meaning I believe.
Herein lies the wish, will you embody it, will you truly request it, achieve an authentic Arab summit?
We pain when he pain, and we rejoice when he rejoices.
I mean, it came with the talk.
Will you play a role in fixing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if only in a non-directive way?
It means they are keen to find solutions, and I am sure that by their wisdom
They may reach an understanding.
Among them, there are many rocks.
He was in harmony in politics, and I am sure that God willing, this will be.
The relations are improving.
Both parties need to be willing to move forward.
But I cannot definitively say that this is what is happening now.
I am sure if Arabs focused on solving the differences between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned.
A state of optimism and a state of pride among citizens that there is a general Arab renaissance.
But I cannot connect what happened in Lebanon.
It can be translated on the ground, meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There is a escalation, perhaps American, Iranian, perhaps other regional issues, meaning...
Will you still fear it for the coming months?
We, as Arabs.
We can only order food and medicine delivery.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready, His Highness the Prince is always prepared.
There are more than a hundred and fifty million Palestinians under siege.
We do not want them to have weapons, nor do we want them to achieve victory, nor do we want...
They do all of this.
And electricity
And we will give it to him, God willing, an organized Red Cross will go and deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, I will get them food, but only medicine.
And our disagreement will continue with them.
I wish upon the Palestinians on both sides to prioritize the national interest.
And they leave the illusions.
This means now the Palestinian schism, this is a big wound.
To the solution
And they did not adhere.
This is a serious matter. They must abide by the agreement of Makkah.
And they must ask that even if they go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And they will resolve this dispute.
They will not benefit.
Empty promises from any side.
I hope that there is a solution, but
Our position on this matter is well known, and an amount is agreed upon for all the concerned parties that we
We will not be a party and will not accept to be a party in any military dispute with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But the most important thing is that we are a sovereign state, and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone sees their own interests, but these interests will neither benefit them nor benefit us.
We believe that the Gulf's destiny is to have a clear agreement between the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
And Iran, to cooperate and to coexist peacefully.
but when a country's Sheikh says that Qatar is not a party
Are there any details or clarifications?
Just an indication.
Never.
Okay, I would like to return, if allowed, to the Lebanese file.
In all seriousness, His Excellency Sheikh means we were in front of a major impasse, only to find a solution in the final hours.
There are those who have linked what happened to what was declared.
Perhaps it is information that may be scattered, unrelated to each other, but what happened?
Even you reached this result.
What happened in Istanbul, I know if there were specific dates beforehand.
Ah, you were aware that there are negotiations.
Continuously in the subject of the solution. Continuously addressing the resolution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change the tactic of the discussions.
The discussions led to...
To a positive result, by bringing together so many parties from so many different entities.
And we started talking.
In this, there is an Arab and Qatari direction in this paper.
Tell me what is wrong with this paper.
And we started talking on the spontaneously, one after the other.
At the last moment, to overcome an obstacle that remained in the end.
But the prince passed by the outskirts.
And remove this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard the word of the Emir of Qatar at the opening session on to Doha
I mean, aren't you considering that your role is now?
Look, the most important thing is to keep this topic out of the spotlight.
We have no regional ambition.
By God, we will have control over a state or something because we are a state.
Our size, we are proud of ourselves, we believe that we can contribute, with our brothers, to solving matters.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
Here are a few
We want her to do something, and this is very important.
Some small states are empowered to undertake this role and to have it supported.
It means that in some things it is excellent, in some things it is good, and in some things it is less than good.
The last question, His Eminence the Sheikh.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
A wish for reconciliation and mending of relationships.
What is nothing but facing Israel.
We will stop playing in the Arab world.
We fix in what the Arab countries, our problems.
A relevant and effective member in Iraq.
To guide him in the affairs.
Regionally and internationally.
But if we put our heads together,
It means what victory is in front of us, or, we don't have any hope.
Thank you, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this valuable interview.
And the international efforts exerted to put an end to the war being waged on Gaza.
And we begin by addressing your request to convene a meeting of the Council of the Arab University at the level of
Ministries, as if you spent the money.
Regarding the request for an urgent Arab summit.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. At the beginning, I am happy to be brother Hassan to be in this program.
And even if the circumstances
The humanity that our brothers in Gaza are exposed to.
Circumstances that require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not disregard the Arab Summit.
We are the truth; when we went with the idea of the Arab Summit before...
Unified is not solely from a Security Council resolution, but also through...
Don't always be stepped on and underestimated.
And let me put it in another sentence.
And we are disciplining.
The street can no longer bear it, if we bear it as officials, the Arab street.
He cannot bear / He cannot stand.
When we were in Cairo.
There were ten to eleven written agreements.
Some of them spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold the meeting.
The more we complicate it, the more important Arab consensus will be.
And I do not blame those whose concern is to see that there is no need for a meeting, perhaps they have their own perspective.
How to solve the problem, or or.
Because it will be solved.
This is the important topic.
Because our goal is not advertising or promotion, our goal is to find
It means you didn't dismiss the summit.
And among them ourselves we ask.
I will go so that we can put pressure on the poor other party.
President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad
Speak clearly that the situation may necessitate holding an Arab summit with whoever is present.
or we found that a majority of the Muslim Brotherhood are in favor of holding the summit
Who was banned?
And I don't know what moderation means.
I mean, we are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, I mean, if we go to any nations in Asia, in Latin America, in various places...
Without a solution.
Which are classified as moderate countries.
And what is moderation in our view?
Do we concede the Palestinian issue?
Because we don't like it.
Should we intervene in the Palestinian issue in a way?
It means that no mother would allow interference from what is good and what is bad.
The one, she is Hamas, Hizbullah, I don't know what tomorrow will bring, another party will emerge. This is the literal and most accurate translation of the provided text.
Is she a student?
And can we, can we, be a part of the Arab world's body?
It means we were planned to enter into an internal Arab conflict.
Okay, and we'll go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope that after I complete my task, Israel will no longer be occupying.
Okay, the second Arab Ministerial Meeting that you invited us to.
Which was characterized by debates, disagreements, and sharp exchanges.
He is at an important point.
This is not the important thing.
If we have a meeting.
From the crossing points.
There is no longer a peace issue.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because on one side they tell you no, we must wait.
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative.
Peace talks with Israel have been suspended.
We say that we are in a position where it is said that we are losing in this topic.
There is a larger loss than what we are currently experiencing. Well, we have always been respectful, courteous, and committed to the decisions made since the truce days.
His Highness Sheikh says that the disputes are not important.
Then there were those who wished to be illuminated upon, upon, Hamaas, and so forth.
This expression represents a political stance more than a dispute between ministers and other ministers, etc.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that has occurred.
But not everyone.
We do not want to speak on behalf of others.
It is very important that we be true to ourselves, true to our nations.
We implement our countries' policies.
Someone acts on her behalf with things of this kind.
I think it means
I don't think they will respect us in the end.
Yes, are there people who play roles, specifically those related to "BB" and acting on behalf of the West?
No, God willing, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this topic.
Following the decision of the Security Council.
What will be his agenda?
The situation seemed decisive in the decision and in the Arab effort.
Here is the translation: And here is the dispute, if Israel immediately implemented the decision.
We can say in a decision.
But Israel did not implement this decision.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter 7, knowing that there is definitely difficulty?
Do not wonder about whom, by the international community, and if you are asked.
With modesty / Bashfully
The situation.
They see that the most important thing they did was fulfill the right of the Jews or the Israelis, something.
They will take their right.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council.
And they agree on a summit and take difficult decisions.
And the Western countries will seek us.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world, among people and nations, and you see how the Arab street is moving on this topic.
But this decision is important.
We are about to have to call our bosses one after the other.
Okay, and in the end, they said, "By God, it turned out there wasn't anything, and it was all just..."
Okay, in a hypothetical scenario where we are like Germany or another country, would we demand [the specific demand or context is missing in the original text]
They don't have to pay the compensations for those who attacked, meaning all you do is provide wrong information.
And you will kill hundreds of thousands.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We, as Arabs, went among ourselves.
He testifies about the how.
Output the topic.
The church and it were already a judgment and a fate.
If the Arab nation says, "If you, then we will send forces to Darfur," then we will also send forces to Darfur.
The Arabs considered or then there were those who considered the decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty.
And the group exerted themselves in bringing out the decision.
What was issued by the Security Council.
I don't want to say that this is a victory or not a victory.
Things end up as they are.
Let's assume that victory...
What are we doing?
We are supposed to be the ones who decide, and we are not obligated to follow it.
But I assure you, we will adhere to the decision.
Unfortunately, you will be bound by it, but it is supposed that you do not commit to the decision.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted.
I mean us.
Will you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think that the Arab nation...
In the current situation, it is ready for any alternative.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
Regarding the implementation of the siege of Gaza.
For other political goals.
To tilt the scales towards one class over another in Palestine, between Palestine, rather than to fix what is broken amongst them.
We started to try to plan.
They once had a gathering, I don't know, Arab or European intelligence agencies, etc., without naming names.
And once they did, meaning we were sitting there subscribing.
in implementation
What is required of us by the West.
Either we go.
This means this is what I want, to have sorting in it.
I mean, of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The repercussions because this topic started two years ago, the topic of Gaza, not now.
I will talk about the topic two years ago, but specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have any reservations about its clauses?
It was صدر, and it wasn't executed.
What did we call?
They might believe that we have a different perspective.
Everyone was required to be on the same viewpoint.
We don't have to all agree on a viewpoint, but I believe that those who went did so with effort.
And we thank them for it.
Regarding what is happening in Gaza for the past two years, and I said that parties...
Prioritizing one class over another. I participated in a topic regarding the siege on Gaza.
Indeed, you agree to the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have come from here and there.
About a genuine Arab complicity in everything that is happening now in Gaza.
It means we are familiar with a specific aspect.
Let me tell you, and we're not privy to everything.
But I know.
The dispute is between Palestinians.
To incite Arabs and internationally.
And if it does not ignite, it will be as if there was no difference, this difference.
And it was after the elections that took place.
And a sense of eagerness for power.
By a majority.
They should be given a chance and we should see...
They want to reform, or are they, or are they people who are still revolutionaries, meaning revolution, is what they know, only the rifle and fighting.
But on the day they came
Arabyan ba'ith akhawanab e'tiqadan anna hadhiyylar mu'aradij radical movement ma yajib an yatikumal ila al-sulta
Now they are saying to each other that there has been an attack.
A Hamas before, it broke the truce, or what are the Palestinians from Gaza, they broke, they broke the truce.
The truce/ceasefire.
Remains the Palestinian people in Gaza for two years, starved.
This is okay.
Due to Israeli security imperatives.
It is clear, okay, we don't want them in this judgment, it doesn't concern me, I am in Qatar.
But what is the sin of the remaining people?
What, and then who decides?
These or those, not every state has the right to self-determination in choosing.
The two governments.
He is the basis of the problem.
But I am sure that if it could be treated.
If we strive, we strive by causing the disagreement to ignite.
But it is clear that if we are required to overcome one class over another because this class...
We consider a category to be terrorist or what we consider to be.
What is happening, all of this led
And also, even the promises that the party promising is making are suitable.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the efforts, both international and Arab, that have been exerted to put an end to what is happening. You, as I mentioned...
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected to date.
And there is the Egyptian initiative which
An Egyptian in Cairo.
On those Egyptian efforts.
It is never a detour.
She is required to play an important role.
And also, Egypt's borders are adjacent to Israel's borders and the borders of Palestine.
That we
And now we are a prophet, we will stop the chaos.
We will bring people to Gaza to stop the chaos.
This is not the way to peace.
There must be.
And that's why we always ask her to play a bigger role.
It was not announced.
It means that it is not possible to assess the initiative now.
Or to give your mother the possibility of success, or of studying.
I believe the chances of success.
If the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt are able to
That they bring the Palestinian points of view closer.
And whoever discusses the initiative should assume the waiting party in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes and can also say no.
And this is an important point.
When the resolution was issued, it was the one thousand eight hundred and sixty.
We have a Palestinian car.
That we don't want to hear from anyone.
But I wish that when the Palestinian delegation left...
And when they went to university, they asked for someone to be with them from Gaza.
Even now, to show the Israelis that these are our brothers, that we are with them, one.
This is an important point.
Let's not make the salad.
She is our target for protection and policy building.
To remain in power.
The Sheikh is here.
I mean, I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't seen its clauses, but...
Do you, as a matter of principle, believe that it is fit to serve as an instrument for the execution of the international resolution one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one, as some have stated?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, because
Each day passes.
Beneath the blood of our brothers, there it is shed.
We do not want to stretch or the Israelis to stretch this subject until they finish their sentence, then we will start to present this initiative.
"And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are keen on it."
And this one, I want clarification. All I'm saying is...
Now I have to solve the matter.
It's not what Israel wants.
Highlighting this Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it mean an expression?
About an Arab vacuum.
And there was no doubt that the position of Laft.
And it has Arabic depth.
دخولها أن في عجز عربي في عجز عربي
We know that there is an Arab deficit.
Part of it is due to the disagreements.
Part of it is due to everyone's perspectives; they all believe that they are right, and that their view is the best.
And so-and-so believes that his point of view is superior.
And there is no consciousness, how can we make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision?
And they will not single us out, one by one.
One would say no, but I will give them two or three days in addition to disciplining them and making the group that was supposed to be as it was, be truly excellent and well-solved.
We must be above this and not accept this.
They might have errors, we will be held accountable by Hamas.
Arabian
But now
At least we can tell them no.
Within the context of the situation, what is also required of Qatar is to take a position, as we hear, we will return to this point, but
In the field, also at the same time, you heard.
Khaled Mashaal, yesterday, was the head of the political office of the Hamas movement.
First, it's not necessary to repeat every time brother Khaled Mashaal, with my respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit down with Khaled Mashaal and talk to him as Arabs?
We will bring him to the Arab University and tell him.
This is important speech.
From Hamas
Conditions imposed by Israel are also conditions imposed.
Let them be the ones to impose conditions, meaning they are forbidden from imposing conditions, and Israel is to impose conditions.
First, what do you think of this popular Arab offering?
That these are riffraff or that these are crowds we shouldn't listen to their words, once they tell me one thing, they don't listen to what you say.
He is completely different. Dsaid, the first thing is to liberate his country.
I swear, allies or non-allies, he liberated his country from Nazi occupation.
Now we are the one being talked about.
The Arabic text is not
Presidents are supposed to represent the views of their people.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations that we witnessed.
It can be fulfilled from these demanding rows.
Also, many of those criticizing Qatar in this situation demand
Despite what is happening, the office, and the representative office are still open.
What are they talking with the same logic?
By cutting off relations, we proceed with all Arab countries.
To cut off all relationships, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They want Qatar, it's only become that.
That we
This is more important than the relationship.
Not just in this decision, in this and in more difficult decisions.
From this decision.
It means that there must inevitably be a unified Arab position for us.
For others
No one sells to anyone yet because it is supposedly to gain some kind of advantage, whether material or intangible, or some claim.
Yes, it means before we close this file on this topic, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good, what motivated his topic? His subject differs. Someone named Chavez has a disagreement with America.
What our people need is not for us to summon.
Five permanent and representative ambassadors, presenting arguments, these are movies.
We finished with that street, now it's smarter than that.
His Excellency Sheikh the highest roof. OR His Excellency the Sheikh, the highest roof.
or or demands that resistance forces in Lebanon confront the Israeli aggression and so on
Do you think that if this matter is framed within a single Arab framework, it can succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that respects us, through which people
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
And we are not motivating.
How will we bring Syria and bring Lebanon and bring the other countries, and there are Arab countries that do not speak with each other?
Nothing should be there.
Qualitative transfer in Arab relations.
It means this is the current policy between the Arab states.
A list, but I believe its validity has expired.
This appears to
The important issue.
And we know how the Lebanese composition works.
Lebanon, there is no doubt that
She gave an example of when her lands would be returned.
The situation in Gaza is different, the situation in Gaza, they are still
Faced with an encirclement from all sides.
And this siege.
It gives a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals for Israel, I mean the goals of the operation for Israel.
The day when you hit So-and-so, the day when you punish So-and-so, the day like this, the day when you please So-and-so.
And therefore, an example that happened in Lebanon, for them, is not a good example.
The solution model that was achieved in Lebanon.
You consider it valid.
Gaza
Look at the problem in Gaza or the Palestinians, their solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
Do we return our land today or return it tomorrow?
Disputes over power.
on the distribution of power
This is different because their tissue is closer to each other.
From the intellectual fabric in Lebanon.
Therefore, the solution is easier.
And here is the problem.
His Excellency Sheikh
I mean, we only have minutes left if we summarize this topic. To what extent can we
And a diplomat means...
How can this operation end?
For the Palestinians in Gaza.
Let me tell you.
Or it could be refusing.
And I will help.
Those who did not walk with us.
Failure is ours, we Arabs.
From a strategic perspective
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we did not witness an integrated initiative.
Why not in the past, nor now?
He is not an issue, not an initiative in the sense we are feeling.
We will help without mentioning the name of Qatar, as some may be sensitive to the name of Qatar.
And our goal is not to bring a summit because we already have the summit in the month of March, which will be held.
Will we be better off than our brothers if we take the initiative? I don't think so.
And do not pressure them.
Because history will not have mercy on us if we put pressure on them.
I mean, we are proceeding with this initiative, and we have seen all the parties are alive. There was a meeting scheduled for April, but it was postponed due to our going to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, that we will make progress. We wish our Arab brothers would help us as much as possible in this matter.
We hope to keep him away from the subject of competition.
The Arabic text "العربية العربيه" translates to: **Arabic Arabic**
In Tajikistan, this happened due to their long-standing dispute with the Sudanese government at some point.
Here are some possible translations, depending on the nuance intended: **Option 1 (More literal):** *
I don't want to delve into this topic.
In Kuwait, on the nineteenth of this month, as far as I believe, of course the Arab situation is as...
As your excellency knows, as you mentioned and elaborated,
Is all of the Arab world helping? This is the first economic summit.
His Highness
And of course, any summit among any Arab brother, we are always present.
And we don't always have the ability to prevent attendance at any summit.
But does he not fear that it could transform into a political summit?
Of course, considering that time imposes itself.
It's too late, even if it means in ten days.
We are talking about Palestinians after they have had twenty-five days eating hit.
it means it is
It is said that the Arab inability to listen is a myth.
This we said.
This we said.
With all due respect, this summit is programmed and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is upon us.
Our way that we are walking in.
And therefore it means I
And we greet.
And he says, "Enough, this is guaranteed."
This is our meeting.
Thank you our viewers for the follow-up.
And to اللقاء, coverage continues for the ongoing war in Gaza. To اللقاء.
A few days ago, there was a celebration of the World Day of People with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
Doha and contributing to the preparation of the draft law on the special.
I also held membership in many local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
As she presented more than seventy-five lectures, working papers, presentations, and published articles in both Arabic and international journals.
Let's begin by agreeing on the terminology currently in use.
For the indication to people with disabilities, are "people with special needs" or as you said, "people with disabilities"? For the indication to people with disabilities, are "people with special needs" or as you said, "people with disabilities"?
Now, first, good evening.
Because people with disabilities have been taken from the rights-oriented approach, or from a culture of human rights.
Because she dealt with people with disabilities, first and foremost as people.
human
And thus his disability resulted from his attempt to adapt to society.
Then the medical concept was to prevail.
Then, the direction of the concept moved towards a concept.
Special education and special needs education appeared.
This class has become...
We became to refer to them as individuals with special needs.
These are the standard rules from which they were derived.
Role of the Special Rapporteur on the monitoring of the implementation of this document.
Then the pace quickened until the international agreement, which was legally binding, was revealed. It was distinguished from the rules in this aspect.
And I set a basic condition or fundamental rule, this term.
Who deals with these people as humans, as people, as individuals.
With the change in terminology, as you kindly تفضلتي, is there a change in the perception of this segment of society?
Yes, and it is measured.
Diverse from one region to another.
But the special thing about this topic
The Arab world has been characterized or differed.
However, the trend towards human rights exists there. A culture of human rights exists, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but perhaps the reasons stem from a lack of financial resources. Is that not the case?
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: that culture exists, but there is a lack of resources. Sometimes it is a lack of political will.
Sometimes legislation, but...
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low, and also, cultural rights awareness does not exist.
Ten percent of the world's population are persons with disabilities.
Eighty percent to ninety percent of persons with disabilities in developing countries of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment.
I mean, through my visit to Darfur.
Or and with the presence of mines and weapons
For males, it is better by a lower degree.
For people with disabilities, they are often in remote areas, in distant regions.
Therefore, there are many trends from organizations operating in this field, which are trying to raise
Awareness is to achieve the truth in education.
Instead of establishing many religious centers, so to speak.
It is heading to that it is establishing rehabilitation centers and hospitals, schools.
This is one of the things for which, thanks to our work at the office, we are grateful.
I tried with the organizations present in the state of Qatar.
and set an agenda for work
Or you can incorporate the agendas of work for these humanitarian organizations, so that those centers are included.
In light of the decline of the situation that disabled people in the world find themselves in.
I cannot call him or agree with you that there has been a regression.
If there is a decline in the Arab region, it is because of the issue of disability.
Within the societal context, within the political context, the economic context, we cannot expect that the conditions of persons with disabilities will be the same.
And they are from the marginalized groups.
In a country like, for example, the Gaza Strip is like Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot make it in an absolute sense that there is no, there is no improvement in the situation.
And indeed, it translated to the ground, for example, if I can manage to provide an example.
Within the crescent of the Qatari Red Crescent.
We agreed that projects would be included.
For persons with disabilities, that is, on the healthy side, within that strategy, and there are other projects.
We tried to insert it as well.
Amid the work of organizations based on the land.
Ma'na, the mother, is perfect now. Karo men Syria. Ahlan bik, Kamo.
Good evening, Suleiman Qaraw.
Solomon, Kuro, عفوا, تفضل, سليمان.
Greetings, good wishes to you and Ms. Hafsa, a respected lady.
First, is there an intellectual disability that is included in the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual disability means a person who was previously healthy became so as a result of pressure. It
Cause of disability due to torture and imprisonment, resulting in intellectual disability to date, while being treated for six years.
I know, I know. There are approximately 400 people, ranging from children to adults, with disabilities resulting from prison sentences.
Is this there is a law in the United Nations
حقيقة يعني أنا
They mean, they know, they are aware, as they know their children.
And means the intention, means the intention without without without without making themselves their titles.
And there are values in the west.
Agreed upon, but people.
From those who understand among people who have apostatized or who have been overcome from Islam, judgment is not to be taken from them.
Thank you very much, Nayef Al Sa'eed. He told us from Kuwait.
I return to our guest to comment on what has been presented in
Communications, Sulaiman wondered if there was an intellectual disability.
Yes, it is within the classification.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Global for disability, certainly intellectual and mental disability as it is called."
She is among these disabilities, which include sensory disabilities in the sense of visual or auditory, and الحركية disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, the disability is...
Action and reaction occurs within a specific societal context.
Throughout the Arab world or in any other regions.
It is certain that addressing disability took a long stage.
And even at the level of the United Nations.
There I, for example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I was trying to address and work on.
Right to all.
Until he makes it seem to them.
The various qualifications to ensure their entry into schools and also organized work.
It focuses on professional rehabilitation, which includes persons with disabilities.
I entered with some improvements on him.
Especially after the reform.
Generally, it exists in this international body.
I am also, meaning as a special rapporteur.
This was positive for me, as it was not directly related.
And those who supported this position.
I saw him in many meetings, for example the International Convention.
Rights of persons with disabilities
It means it hindered her with some of these restrictions or limitations.
For example, concerning legal capacity.
This is one of the fundamental points in the world of disability, which does not
The United Nations, unfortunately, suspended it to some extent during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies.
For example, I will end with this.
World: Governments, organizations, and non-governmental organizations. The Member States of the United Nations.
We directed another questionnaire.
United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions.
We would like to know to what extent programs for disabilities are on their agendas.
If there are budgets, if there is participation for people with disabilities.
Human rights
Not just fragments to grow him.
Okay, we will receive more calls from you now, Mr. Naji, a survivor from Algeria. Please, Mr. Naji.
And peace be upon you.
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria, from Oujarf exactly.
I loved to ask, I am originally from a country, I am physically challenged.
Okay, we will direct this question to her: Naji Meshry, you talked to us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Aleppine from Greece, prefer Ahmed.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, even taking them on seasonal outings, this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mentally ill person considered a disabled person?
Particularly, they might cause harm to others or to themselves.
Everything we are talking about in the unproductive discussion area, and thank you.
The sister Hessa mentioned the financial shortfall.
I am particularly addressing the issue of poor countries, specifically those in Africa and Latin America, and I am demanding action from them.
Establish an International Disability Support Fund and allocate a one percent share of the net profits of each institution in the world.
And that will be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
The inability to provide much for those with disabilities, war victims, and so on.
Thank you very much, Aba Ibrahim Abdullah, you spoke to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Meshri wonders and presents his problem: he is disabled.
at the local level or at the national level, meaning through Algeria
The needs within the local community must be met within that community.
It is the same rights that should come to any other person.
Meaning the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I am truly praying from here, from this platform, to the governments, and to the Arab governments in particular.
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual.
For ensuring
Those needs and rights are within the existing agendas.
No, there is no need, I mean, L, L, to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of a person with a disability, or not at all if this country.
She is originally, she must be committed to performing.
I advise him first to return and go back to the authorities responsible at the governmental level if possible.
Because that is within the national domain and must be carried out within this domain.
Your mentioning of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, there are many signatory nations but do not commit.
And here we pose a question from a connecting individual who asked, "Why are there no laws there?"
He is indeed a reality. We are in a human, humane society, meaning there is a lot of wrong and a lot of right.
Certainly, many agreements and, certainly, many covenants do not have a literal, binding commitment.
Many countries have adhered to numerous conventions, such as CEDAW and others.
But there are breaches and violations, and we know about it.
But the issue is to adopt an agreement and organize around it.
First, we will ensure, at least, that we ensure there is awareness.
This awareness begins from the highest peak of this pyramid, which is, the decision-makers.
Officials then progress until they reach society as a whole.
The issue, our commitment to prepare reports, and these reports reach the United Nations.
The question of knowledge and understanding, and the elevation of the degree of awareness and
For the reports, you acted as a rapporteur for the United Nations. Is that correct?
Yes, from what I've seen and recorded, there is an interest.
Therefore, I am there is a relative advantage to the treaty for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and call.

The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.

When I worked these six years, there was hardly any support.
Excluding those from China and Austria.
It always means I thank this country for this support.
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.

This translates to: **"Yes, this lack of support indicates what."**

My question is about prevention.
As it is said, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, regardless of war and traffic accidents.
For the genetic level, perhaps a result meaning a shortcoming on the part of the families, which is the marriage of relatives.
I think that's a high percentage.
They lead to disability.

The first connected individual, Hamad Al-Marri, wondered about

The marriage of close relatives poses dangers.
And genetic factors.

And with customs and traditions, but it takes certain time.
Especially in tribal communities.
But over time, there is a response to it, but it is essential that there is a legal obligation, meaning
Yes, Krwan Bahgat wondered and suggested that one percent of the budget of the Arab countries be allocated.
Let me first help those with disabilities.
Yes, there is the statistical estimation applied by the World Health Organization to the entire world.
There are forty or approximately forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are doubling.
A study in South Africa showed and proved.
It is certain that the statistics that emerged about the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza are

Okay, Karim, do you have a direct question, just for the sake of time? Due to time constraints, I apologize for not being able to assist further.
Do you have a direct question?
Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan provide excellent services.
Commentary on what was said in the viewers' calls.
It means a person who works in this field.
With regard to the topic...
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
Those which become binding immediately upon their ratification and accession.
And as a duty of this state or of these organizations.
Because it stems from an issue of rights for these individuals, regardless.
and frankly, what is it that
The doing during that period for the disabled and not
And you now wish for it to come true.
Certainly, I hope from both.
I hope this research or this survey will be based on this, and more qualitative research will be presented in this field.
Likewise, it became clear to me from this experience.
His six years of experience include...
and coordination between Arab countries as well
They also have a role. It's not just a matter of rights; they are the recipients of those rights.
Sheikhha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on Disability, thank you.
We welcome the elegant broadcaster to Al Bayt Channel. We are Al Bayt. Good morning.
and also it makes me happy to welcome Captain Ali Kassem, who is shining in the ranks of Al Wasl Club.
Welcome, Ali.
Welcome to you.
Good morning
I will leave the field to you to congratulate. Everyone will be congratulated at their own pace. (Lana Itfadhali)
I had an open studio for five hours and without it, I had two hours without it today.
I congratulate the State of Qatar, land, government, people. They deserve it for sure. This is a global achievement.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: I could have taken this opportunity to congratulate and bless Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
Or his Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim.
Yes, of course, because you are from the sports field, from those working in this field, and those who are knowledgeable about these lines and this field in a greater way.
Because even we
and it competed meaning we deserved it when we got one vote fewer than the others between us and America, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for America.
Not from the night, because our file is rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, supported a lot, let's say the fields.
يعني there were some people who were afraid that perhaps there would be a situation similar to America.
And perhaps there will be, meaning in some countries, these things will be ready, خلاص, they don't need to prepare stadiums or prepare some special projects related to this event.
Because they are already ready.
But they were afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you athletes, I expect this to be a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect it will enter the domain of economics, politics, and health.
Just Croatians
What does this quantity mean, this achievement?
Of course, an achievement is bigger, especially for us as Moroccans. You, even if you're not a Moroccan, have you seen their joy? How?
God willing, Ali will tell me, and I will be informed at the moment of the announcement.
By God, I was about to leave the training, and we were hearing on the radio.
We were waiting for him, and I had a friend from the quarter with me, and...
Walking in the car, playing the radio.
The first thing they announced was Qatar.
We all screamed, "US and THEM, and of course, ABSOLUTELY NO EXIT!"
My friend went out of the opening.
Shouting while the world looks on, tending to our trivial matters and journeys of our own spirit.
We had a march from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was not a particularly special day, I would expect. And all the channels would have perhaps focused more on this event.
Lana, you are definitely present within this topic.
And especially the channels dedicated to sports.
How did they celebrate this topic and what was their reaction?
There were media outlets, most of the world's channels.
Main teacher it became really clear indeed on the map known Qatar
Definitely, also meaning the player's presence in the national team, this is a very important task.
And I expect that this is a greater responsibility on his shoulders.
What is your opinion on this specific point?
Okay, Captain Ali, what are the specifications that this player, who will be part of this national team, must meet?
Here are a few options, depending on the
And we now mean it, we have to count a strong generation.
It means he has fundamental rules and techniques, studied in a mathematical sense, in football.
What are the rules that must be available and the fundamentals that must be available in this player?
I believe that professionalism ensures everything.
Diligence in exercises, Persistence in exercises, Discipline
Here are a few possible translations, ordered by how closely they adhere to the original Arabic phrasing and intent:
Each stage, in my opinion, has its own character; you don't assign a specific trait to it.
She has so many nuances, feelings, and perceptions.
From various diverse programs to sports, where, where is the most beautiful for you, where, where did you feel yourself more?
By God, it's beautiful.
It really makes you want to take care of yourself, to know that how I want to protect myself is through exercise, that's the most important thing.
Then you have football, adored by fans, followed by everyone, whether you like it or not. When you missed the field, you wanted to become someone who loved it.
What encloses the media personality in one aspect for us.
What confines you like that, puts you in a certain aspect?
Any sport, not just football.
Both sports are not good. The sports are not good.
Ali also means with several important things that we would like to talk about.
I didn't like you coming back like this, being ten years younger so you could arrive in **two thousand twenty-two**
I didn't wish for this job.
"Tab'an ehna akeed, al-wahid yatamanna hal-shay, khassa en kas al-world ya'ni ahyen ay la'eb en."
That is to say, regarding what is mentioned, indeed only one watches the World Cup match and is happy and delighted, so what is the point of it not to be playing in the World Cup?
I hope they are up to the task and that people are well-behaved, God willing. This is their chance, God willing.
What is the word you would like to say from a professional player? What is the word you would like to say from the heart for them?
During this period, we loved that you would be present with us.
By God, just like how things are currently, it means vacation, but...
He returned him to the championships after an absence of twelve years from a championship, the Gulf Cup.
You were definitely meaning, God bless you, you have a beautiful, unique fingerprint from Qatar Television, and sweet memories.
Mashallah, so Qatar TV has become like a university, graduating a large group of media professionals.
Our national team is a strong one. God willing, it will حصد numerous different awards.
Let's talk about his work with the Al Sadd club mission.
What's your position there? What's your news there, God willing, that you are comfortable.
Certainly, thank God, honestly, or the ancestors.
Yesterday, of course, and he was present with us in the studio. We spoke a lot about the players.
I expect so in some of the youth who are sitting and following us. I expect that even now they feel that you are one of them.
This appears
It means in a natural image in the Qatari League professionalism and players' transfer.
I think I got my chance in Am AsSal, regarding it as a proposal or as a proposal.
I was able to take the place of the Asia Cup with the team, thank God.
My situation, thank God, is good with the team.
Subject: Sports, how can we make it a social gathering?
And how can we introduce sports to women, children, young people?
It links them together, meaning everything complements sports.
You have even in various fields of women's sports, a role.
Awareness of sports has spread to every individual, from the young to the old, in this society.
Here are the years, approximately, to reach or expect: * **Up to or around 10 years** to reach or expect, as per the provided text.
Because we have the new generations, they keep looking at the roads.
In a generation currently passing through, growing up, but there is a generation after it that must also be founded from a young age, with awareness and physical education.
We have the Aspire, the Aspire's Statement is something we don't deny, a great establishment, a founder.
One and only actually for the new generation of sports.
We only have to set our intention and launch forth.
And they love hating football in particular.
How can I bring the audience so that they can communicate directly with all, I mean, the matches, even between clubs?
By God, my word, that's the truth, it's a problem we have in the Qatari League, which is the lack of fans.
We only have this problem, this attendance, meaning what the Qatari Federation has not yet found as a solution to attract the masses.
What is the style we should use to attract them to follow these matches?
It depends on the individual, meaning some people don't like to block the field.
The media has a key role, you know, in
Here, they started to currently implement a ticket system or point collection system, a point accumulation system.
No, it is the union, meaning it has a plan, several steps to attract the masses.
Some clubs have ways like Al-Rayyan to attract audiences. Of course, Al-Rayyan is wealthy; it doesn't need audiences.
Some clubs must that some club administrations do activities, hold events.
Public interest تحفيز حق الجمهور بس i think these are the means that i have.
The players, meaning the new generation.
Their love for the job, their faith in their abilities, and as someone who provides not just material support but also moral support, it is extremely beneficial.
We are definitely grateful for this good meeting, God willing.
So, we decided to take the last words from you, on the occasion of this wonderful win, of course, for Qatar, the file of the World Cup two thousand and twenty-two, for us, take a place, begin.
We can confirm with certainty that Qatar did not insist, on the contrary, it excelled and fulfilled its commitments, and it always delivers on its promises and lives up to its commitments.
God willing, I have a favor to ask, Captain Ali. The final word I'd like to address in this meeting is...
And I tell them congratulations, and God willing, to a better future, God willing.
Thank you forقاسم captain and player, and we wish you all the best, God willing, in your sporting career and in your life as well. May God grant you success, O Lord.
And we became to love sports more and more.
The episode's topic is young talents.
Some young people claim that during this period, these songs are indeed prevalent now, but they have a very deep and significant history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English lyrics.
We will today follow up on this topic with a group of hip-hop enthusiasts.
And we will get to know them in great detail through our meeting that will bring us together on air.
Welcome to you, our viewers, wherever you are.
Years ago, a new type of singing spread across the Arab world and the Gulf.
Coming from the west and specifically from America, it is a rap song.
And before delving into the topic of singing rap
There is a flaw in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
For writing the lyrics of a song.
Almost all rap singers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are numerous and important, which we will get to know through two individuals who are strongly involved in this field.
They made a nice band.
I welcome Yousef Al-Naimi and Salman Abdullah Yousef, good morning.
Welcome to you, Salman, good morning.
Good morning, oh welcome.
I am very happy to have you with us through, of course, this program.
And also through the topic, of course, is the singing of rap.
What is your business in the matter, Youssef?
We saw that it means the art of rap was not meant to exist in its initial form.
Batrougha ahla
By the tongue of the citizen.
Here are a few accurate translations, ordered by how closely
Yes, I am able to because of the rap.
And these songs, I long for them. They are art, one of the arts, just as visual art paints a picture, a poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the musician can play on any instrument.
You feel accepted by Qatari society and the Gulf community for this type of song.
Twelve ten.
There you feel that people have become who love to acquire
مختلف الاعمار
And there are families, and there are, I mean, a lot of people who have become more used to listening than speaking.
It was like a website.
And how many of you are in this band until now?
Meaning everyone can say words, write poetry, and perform it in a rap style.
The rapper, by God, just as you are saying, you can say that he who sings, he is himself.
He is the one who plays sometimes and is the one who writes the words.
Okay.
Listen to him, I swear, I swear, I recorded this song, this one.
Okay, now all these songs that I produced from Salman, from you, from Youssef, from whomever, from the band itself...
I didn't think it would be present on a specific CD sold in stores.
But you know, when you are a personality, it means I am going to create an album and put it on the market. These are difficult, like obtaining a commercial register and going through procedures.
Okay, why didn't you think? You are 25, meaning you are always "One hand alone doesn't clap."
You must have many, God bless you, all twenty-five, may God protect you all, as young men and brothers.
Make a CD, this CD you can promote through more than one website online.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have it through local newspapers.
There are thirteen songs, as far as I can recall.
The registration is not the same now.
A bit old, but it was, I mean, clear.
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not like now, but it's clear.
And he almost made about fifty CDs.
It means that I can't not say that there is something, because it's possible that some of the youth know this art for ten years.
Not strongly registration, and I expect distribution in this period. Now I am different.
And especially since it has a large collection of music, a large collection of music genres, techno now.
These are young men or these are the artists who produce a large collection of beautiful songs.
Also, we want to talk about the parties you participated in.
I swear, look at the party that means in Doha, we participated in one party.
Of course, the Al-Sadd club organized it for us, meaning they didn't do it with us.
The audience awaits.
Let's see, I mean, we didn't expect this number.
What surprised us about it is that the families are more.
Families are more than young people.
From to and it was an organization meaning splendor.
And we were a bit confused, and it was the first time for us in Doha.
It means we expected no turnout.
But the audience engagement was fantastic.
It was a long time with the benefits of songs meaning.
Okay, let's hear something, or words from one of the songs they composed, for example, that was released to the public and met with the youth's particular approval.
For example, let's listen to some words, even if we don't fully understand them, let's present them to the viewer.
We can hear it on the airwaves.
at your ease, please
Here you go safely.
I am the problem, my words are a little, I mean.
Let's hear it.
I don't know.
We now have the Sabah Al Duha program.
The one comes, he wakes up in the morning with an open mind.
Salman is like a mountain; he's been in the rap scene for five years.
Even if someone is not accepted, they are not necessarily poor.
I brought a lot of people along for the ride.
I need to translate some words.
Okay, the songs that you all sang, for example, give me a sentence from, for instance, one of the sentences you all said.
He, look, not every song is random, meaning he's the one who told it now, what's important is what they call it in English, freestyle.
It means the same weight.
But when we sing a song, it means we carefully write the lyrics.
Thank you, let's follow it.
Greetings, my countrymen, greetings to Qatar! With the "Sabah Al Duwaha" program.
Stay visible, present, and on air directly for the viewers.
They see one, one, two, two. What do they do? They review a little bit of the arts.
We have a morning program called "Good Morning Doha."
Of course, the beautiful song you saw.
I am currently insisting on the young people, on top of it all being present on the internet and available everywhere.
Do you really greet them when you recorded it?
She was a subscriber.
Everyone among us, each one, claims his right to himself.
I feel that Youssef might not be able to fully accept my words, either because he takes them negatively or because he can't process them.
Each person takes words.
We are definitely, I mean, I expect that every artist, every painter, and every poet, always that
He can also write about his love for sports.
For the love of one's own homeland.
I'm sure you participated in National Day through the procession.
From the beautiful songs, because you are young Qatari men, you also represent, meaning Qatar.
Doha is being decorated to welcome, of course, the Asian Cup, and there will be a large procession along the Corniche.
To receive this event
Here are the English translations of the
Doha receives the Asia Cup.
From Doha Airport to now.
We will follow together these clips live on air.
To receive, but understand the presence, the existence of these crowds, the existence of these our children, the students, I mean...
And it arrived an hour earlier than this morning's departure from Doha airport for the Asia Cup, to complete...
Preparations for hosting the major continental event.
We return once again to our esteemed guests Yousef and Salman, who illuminate the studio.
And him, a rap group, a pan-Arab Gulf rap group, Qatari, right?
We can say about you this.
By God, it means... currently, it means...
Any arrangement for a party is possible but not certain.
Just now, you are working on a specific concert, and it will be announced soon, God willing, Youssef.
God willing, but it doesn't mean it's not certain, I mean, until now, at the beginning of the journey...
May the beginning of your journey be filled with all the best wishes for success. You can be absolutely certain that our program, God willing, will be your steadfast support. We do this with all the sincerity of our hearts.
It also means Salman, where do you all gather as young people, around the age of twenty-five?
Where is the meeting held and how do you put the ideas, how do you write them down together?
Definitely, there must be some songs with both artists.
It's not necessary for anyone to, for example, be a single person like Salman or Yousef, or anyone among them who can sing an entire song.
There must be several harmonies between you and where you meet, and when you meet.
I swear, look, there are twenty-five individuals, it's difficult to gather them all at once.
I started talking to Youssef and talking to so-and-so and talking to them because today, maybe we will gather in a place.
In order to understand the idea and lyrics of the song.
And in its secondary path, after...
I record the what is on me.
Let him hear, and he will continue. Let him hear, and he will proceed.
This will be your salvation, Yusuf will record, and he will respond and send, to tell me about some matters.
Do you see the experiences that exist outside?
You take, meaning acquire, some CDs of bigger artists.
Take some experience, take it from them, meaning some of the techniques.
This is definitely us, always I mean.
The artists who means have they been for years in this field or that they have experience and their position in this field
One listens to them, finds their methods, their ways, and tries to create a style, meaning not imitating it.
It means if I do the same style, the same tone of voice, the same level of words.
I'm sitting there imitating myself, saying "I, I," and then immediately claiming not to be doing anything new, but rather something special that is uniquely mine.
It means we should rely on them a little.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of young Gulfis in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive style, we follow together this report and benefit and enjoy as well. Let's see with each other this report.
The obscurity still envelops that talent which some persons enjoy.
Using very rudimentary means.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Dayel
Which is located far from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
One hundred fifty kiles
He possesses outstanding ability and vast experience.
For detecting the locations of groundwater and surface water.
And in depths exceeding one hundred meters.
You know that digging wells is expensive.
But with the presence of the expert, he can to determine the appropriate location for digging the well.
Certainly, a way to discover or...
Locating the water
She has been since ancient times.
They were the fathers and ancestors of our ancient forefathers.
They will use the expertise of experienced people to accurately determine the locations of the water wells.
For drilling.
Abu Ibrahim's methods for discovering water.
Not modern devices.
Or a soil analysis in scientific laboratories.
He bases his work on God's guidance.
And its conduits are below the ground.
It is either a pomegranate stick.
A branch of pomegranate or a branch of fig.
Now we apply practically the process of detecting watercourses.
It starts now, you begin to stand, this is the end of the flow.
Go back a second time.
Go back, go back.
This appears to be a nonsensical string of words or a partial phrase. Without further context, a definitive translation cannot be provided.
And from here ends the watercourse.
Requires great experience and long patience.
so that the detector can access its sensitivity to the movement of instruments
I went to more than one area.
It means a success rate of ninety-five percent.
This is definitely the method and the way of using the copper rods.
And he, of course, doesn't know a precise scientific explanation.
This method.
It is surprising to note the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
It is more than ninety-five percent.
To detect the locations of surface water groundwater.
Glory be to Allah. Humanity, Allah taught man what he did not know. This is a report, of course, of what we took, of course, from the country of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They formed a special band for them, and they ended up with more than one CD.
Whether it's online or in some of them, by phone.
In the formation of competitions, sometimes there are rivalries between the Gulf countries, between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, and between Qatar and
You can download a stronger song about a stronger topic.
About a problem, about, meaning, and so on, many topics.
Emulate him, or if you are like me, my role model, then you are hollow, there is nothing inside.
God willing.
And at the same time, we might take such and such.
It also means a large collection of songs.
What we tried, as much as possible,
Here's the translation of the Arabic text, presente
Even us, we know what the news is, first by first, for this band.
But I emphasize the name of the band.
Qatari rappers
We will return again, and our guests will be present, and we will return to the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere that
We are definitely with you live on air through the direct link that we are transmitting to you, our viewers.
Wherever you are on the corniche and at the reception for the Asia Cup.
Those we are definitely proud of, and proud of the various arts.
and addresses many social, psychological problems in young people
But you are in studio two.
Definitely, they will complete the twenty-five.
We welcome Yousef and Salman again. May God greet you all again.
May the subscription stop.
We are trying to reach the company, but we don't know where the company is or if anyone will respond to us.
I must develop myself, at least the person who is outside.
Facebook, YouTube
I mean the websites that are like this.
On behalf of the band.
We received the information; we are ready to proceed immediately.
You are arranged just as we saw with each other, God bless you, you did this work.
You make these songs, then you attach them to a collection of images, your images, as individuals.
Or, you can download it to YouTube, you can upload it to websites where there might be videos that someone could follow.
By God, we have stayed before.
And there are many songs actually.
The obstacles you are exercising to overcome are that there is no location for which you need a company to adopt you.
No, you really don't need a place to gather as a team.
Here are a few possible translations, depending on the nuance you want to convey:
That means, okay, we're caught.
Tell us, come on, we'll tell you, we'll arrange it for you, we'll bring you an album.
Does "ايكون" mean something like "means something" or "something official" implies?
Because it means it's a five-year period now.
It means a lot, no more.
Yes, we shared things with them. We participated in programs with them. We shared in series with them.
I wish to develop, to be...
That means there is something, it supports us, we are always with it.
Yes, and we also want to know your wishes, Salman, just like Yusuf's wishes. What could you possibly say?
The only wish, almost, was for a music video.
God willing, we wish you all the best. God willing, through this band, we will achieve success.
We wish, God willing, that your songs will always be present, both in the Arab world and globally.
And indeed, this is a refined art, an auditory art to a greater extent.
And in it are letters, just as you mentioned.
May He guide you, God willing, always, and we wish you all the best, God willing.
"Pass my greetings to the whole group, and good luck, God willing."
We will conclude this meeting with the song they created for the program.
Accompanying you are DJ Mr. Bobo on the Sabah Al Douha morning program.
Good morning, good morning ladies and gentlemen.
This is how Mr. Bobo and this key together, one hot to break.
Greetings, O my countrymen, Greetings, O Qatar! With the program, Sabah Al-Duha!
Stay visible, present, and on air directly for the viewers.
And don't forget the program is shown nine thirty in the morning, meaning every one is sitting in front of the television.
They see one, one, two, two. What do they do? They review a little of the arts.
We have a morning program called "Good Morning Doha."
Hasan Naama is with us in the preparation. Shima Al-Hammadi is with us in the presentation.
With us in the directing is Nasser Al-Malki, the guests of the episode, the rappers of Qatar, for sure.
It is repeated, meaning once again, and it is benefited from in the house.
This is an elevator or a shopping cart.
Do you put anything in it? The person shops, so in the supermarket or elsewhere.
Here's the translation of the provided text: Any merchandise you put in the cart on the website, anything you are craving to buy.
The product comes with a larger screen, showing the product's components and identifying the product.
Here is a translation of the provided text into English, as requested: **"This is also an idea that was wonderful and applicable."**
It means it's just a parachute, a housing unit, that works, an icon in the car, to uncover this item.
And it will give you with the buyer, it will make the purchase process easier for him.
He takes full details on a dedicated screen.
I expect this to be more in line with a healthier awareness.
When it's in a device with you, even with the same car.
More ingredients
And the dangers, what are their harms too?
Details will be fully included, meaning
Or an ambition he has, I mean for example there were a number of projects, maybe four or five.
Deals with traffic problems.
Tackles traffic congestion and other parking problems, and was also creative and very beautiful, I mean.
Masha'Allah, the Cultural Center for Childhood as well.
Let us, Mr. Abdullah, also talk about the various activities that we will see, God willing, in the coming days.
Yes, by God, there are surprises, of course, I mean, but it passed by quickly.
If you like, I can mention some of the projects that are being presented.
Here are some possible translations, depending on the intended nuance of the Arabic: **Option
That everyone who leaves their house has, in other words, a suitcase.
They gather at a specific point.
Here are the translations: This is of course all the photos that those sitting and watching are following, I expect them to enjoy them.
Childrens Creations
Exactly, yes, for example, in a similar situation to the cash register.
For example, for women, I have a card.
Insert this card, I would say for example I need a black t-shirt.
Here's the translation of the provided text into English: "This is for example now some shops or for example I have some missing things in the house, a key I don't know what it is."
What I realized, for example, are the office keys, the keys for the...
We of course are based, we have a main goal, that is what Her Highness Sheikha Mozah aimed for.
His Highness the Prince
At an early stage, this has paramount importance in project design.
Also, selected from among three hundred children, was Ayza.
Then, we also have promising preachers in Ramadan.
Yes, she is the one who presented the closing ceremony. She was a broadcaster.
Indeed, it means we want to open our chests and doors to all children who want to provide their programs.
And after them, they set off.
And our need for support in this as well and their presence, this is something at the top of our priorities.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
Based on the variety and diversity of children's skills.
to self-development
Okay, do you have cooperation with other clubs in different youth clubs in Qatar?
And there are also, I mean, scientific clubs existing in Qatar.
We of course, all of our programs are built upon partnerships.
Our entire portfolio consists of specialized partnerships.
With a group, there are also community service institutions specialized in developing these skills.
In partnership with all interested institutions in the field.
The Association, Association for the Study of Photographic Imaging
The General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, and also the Girl Innovation Center, played a very significant role.
Yes, he had a major role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children on it.
And attract them and encourage them for children, all our programs are built on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions.
And what has changed for you?
"Naturally, our presence in Katara gave us a strong push and significant support."
And a faster form.
Now, of course, there is a group of projects in partnership with Katara. Now, the preparations for them are underway, God willing, within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what is not related to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are walking in it now, especially since we are now in a time, a time of preparation.
And building a promising future, scientifically for all children and future generations, and for the coming youth, God willing.
The word I would like to present to the parents and to the youth who are following us and to the children who would like to be present through the center.
From what we are now giving.
Our children's times, their ideas are not to be underestimated or belittled.
And we must give it attention, no matter what these ideas are.
Because it really means, from this thought, this interest in it will develop this thought. At the very least, if we develop the child's love to thinking,
This is very important that I pay attention.
I communicate with him spiritually. I communicate with him now. Our big problem is that most fathers...
He provides him with support.
He encourages him, so we urge parents and educators.
They give more attention to their children's imagination today, for they are the future, and they are the origin of this future.
I really lived while we were wandering through this exhibition between their projects.
I was living in a dream.
I mean, in a dream, ideas are all fantasy, very wide, I mean.
And now, the dream means it is surely a reality there are many dreams that have come true and become a reality
Thank God, we hope, God willing, that our children, who were present, will find success.
And our hopes with you are hanging, with you, God willing.
By his permission, indeed.
Of various ages and genders.
I have reached seventy projects.
Pioneering and new projects in implementation.
To discuss this exhibit further.
The national and the cultural childhood center also.
Assistant Abdullah, also in the beginning, I mean, briefly, tell us about the exhibition.
What does it encompass that brings together many, for sure, of the events? So, what can we briefly say about this exhibition?
It was a new pattern in expression, the expression of children about their love, loyalty, and belonging to the homeland.
Of course, it came under the sponsorship of the Minister of Education and the Minister of Higher Education.
At the exhibition tour, this exhibition came.
He starts growing with him until he reaches twenty-thirty.
Certainly, we started training children to see Qatar's twenty-thirty vision with its five pillars.
Human Development, Economic Development, Sustainable Development, Environmental Development
First, it knows where it is now, meaning Qatar in twenty thirty, where will it reach?
Then he starts to think about how his way of thinking is.
How does he innovate and how does he come up with creative ideas?
I expect this is how it is, his field is right here, mashallah he is vast.
But when we give him certain specific symbols and help him.
I expect his thinking will grow larger and more extensive.
Under the slogan "Such [is] the Name of the Exhibit," the organizers launched the exhibition titled "Dreams of Generations and the Facts of Tomorrow."
This is the emblem, the dreams, the generations, today.
He will be part of Qatar's future.
And indeed, we felt this while touring with the children. When the child speaks or says "Haqq, His Excellency the Minister,"
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project in twenty thirty.
The child is thinking about twenty years from now.
He expresses his love for the homeland and what it means, something he adores in its field.
Definitely, different activities will accompany it, such as events, contests.
Some of them were winners of the Stars of Science award.
There was also among the winners the first prize for the Arab League University.
Of course, all the children.
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were displays, meaning there were different displays with a specific schedule.
To showcase their projects that they have completed, meaning during the Exhibition.
What's good, an attendance, an attendance that stands out.
نجوم العلوم
Some of the winners are the winners of projects that participated in the exhibition.
The one who won, also, one of the main awards.
That which is the jungle or the reserve.
Let's also talk about colored hatred.
Behind the colorful, of course, we were also among the vision, the children's dream, of a future for Qatar.
Thinking also about twenty-two in twenty-two.
How can a child contribute to a creative project idea for twenty-two?
Its main idea is that there should be an existing chip in the ball.
It gives color when ruling.
If, for example, in a, it means everyone is watching the referee, the movements of this ball through...
or the movements on the field and what changes in it through this electronic chip
Those who were present in the ball room.
Ideas, of course, creative ideas, of course, it is the main idea. One might be surprised. Yes, yes, people ask us many things.
These projects
We always say we haven't reached with the children.
At this stage of forming or developing these skills, from expanding their horizons.
Who gave them the idea of a way to express love for the homeland through these projects?
Who gave them the self-confidence to how to present their project, whether to face the public and explain their idea.
Within the scope of his areas of interest, in the realm of something he loves, this entirety is considered an achievement, an achievement for...
He extended support, support meaning he could on my behalf and express thanks for it.
Now you are entering the stages of development and
To support several of the officials, and support from the committee, and I expect support also from the audience.
The forest was never the second; it was the forest because of this child.
The way in which subscribers enter: The channels for which the pipes that allow visitors to enter are located under the ground.
Large protected big game forest
And the visitor wanders in it to see the animals, sorry the reptiles, under the ground.
And in a sensor, we measure some animals, and an R&D center, it means the state of the animals.
And in the marine environment and entering it in an innovative way.
The reason for her victory was also her vast imagination,
This is of course their family.
Of course, there are those who speak about a city, a tourist destination, underwater.
Some speak of a city of butterflies.
Some people are talking about a forest, a forest above the earth.
Some are talking about many tourist ideas.
It means: exciting.
Perhaps this is something the minds of children now, at this time, perhaps in 2030, 2040, 2050...
And and in the future, perhaps these things will indeed come true.
It means there are three projects.
He said, "These projects, I need them now. I want to work on them."
For example, the, the, the, the, water, air, conditioning, system.
Let's see now the Arab newspaper.
The news says Qatar University is celebrating graduation.
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for Education
Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President of the University.
Good achievement, definitely recorded, means for the beautiful university.
Qatar University and also the University of Kalyari.
And also these good news that we are reading about our students.
A leading educational achievement, God willing, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specializations, God willing.
Where he is considered one of the young faces coming strongly to the stage of Qatari drama.
And until when, and also classifications and colored threads
And artist Abdelhamid Al-Shirshani is considered among the artists who formed their own identity.
It would not have been convincing.
It would not have been chosen to be present in the business activities carried out within Qatar.
and currently artist Abdelhamid Al-Shirshani is participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Classifications Part Two".
We are pleased that our guest for this morning...
In order to talk to him about his participation in these two important works and about his general experience.
Welcome to you, and good morning.
Nwart barnamij sabah al-dohha hai la awwal marra ana baltaqi feek wala awwal marra betkoon mawgood ma'ana fi sabah al-dohha
And by God, the people who are tired of the program...
And you are Lisa's sister.
Welcome, let's get started with the conversation.
Let's see.
I am a responsible and administrative man.
And apply the laws.
All I can tell you.
Bring the coat.
Then listen, why did you come to me?
Go see them, if anyone agrees that you won't be sent back the bisht.
منه and of course I had a question for myself as a beginning but since we saw this clip from the series "Tasaneef" Part 1
pointing out that Khalid ibn al-Walid
And some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qays to the city of Marat.
Many things and information are linked to this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more, we continue this beautiful report with you, presented by الزميل عبدالرحمن مرشد.
We follow up with each other.
Definitely, it's a testimony from someone who doesn't know courtesy or partiality.
And to emphasize the antiquity of this or that city, **Translation:** **"And to emphasize the antiquity of this or that city,"**
To the extent that we observe its traces and hear what was said about it by its narrators, poets, and others.
Their ancient and their modern, for that which comes forth is a register full of writing, which is added to the register of the city.**
And the city of Marat is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is an ancient, historically old town that originated in the Pre-Islamic era.
Historians disagreed on the reason for its naming.
Some attribute it to Imru' al-Qays al-Kindi, the well-known poet.
And to the pool, which is attributed to him.
Its establishment date is unknown.
The Pre-Islamic Era
Also, one of the most famous things in the city of Marat is the Kahlam Mountain, after which the proverb was struck.
Because it is located in the city and is attached to it.
These are also archaeological sites.
It is numerous, and since this landmark is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Marat carried out tremendous efforts.
From a park above this mountain.
And there were sessions for parents and for residents of the kingdom.
It was named in honor of the noble companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the Liar.
Among its effects, too, is a kumayt (red) pool.
It is a place where floodwaters gather, and it retains water for a long period.
And it was one of the most important sources of water in the ancient era.
Among its effects, too, is the Aw-Douhi Heritage House.
Times, its city, dates back to before Islam.
She became famous for her poets whose poetic fervor was inflamed.
In its beauty, its effects, and its famous red mountain, as is known.
Abdelrahman Al-Murshed was in the Sabah Al-Duha program.
Madyat Marat Shmal Al-Riyadh
We are once again returning to our esteemed guests.
We wish we had been informed and informed the viewers about these methods and these means.
As in the beginning I spoke, we in the infrastructure have infrastructure that is very specific.
We will open a page for him to be registered and have a special file on our system.
The email address of his guardian.
This manipulation involves an extent of increased concentration, writing speed, adhesive speed, and overall scattering.
The guardian has complete deception.
This is good, this is the manipulation that is added to the student's file.
To his son's file online.
And see how much his son has progressed, meaning
And he sees his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
Even, actually, we enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful child.
We had brought most of the children present at the center, and direct them the most beautiful greetings.
I entered this center with a teacher, who is present through this center.
and get to know her intelligence and the level she reached, of course, from her entry into this center
Okay, here
Focus on his work, and after Armadhan.
But this of course is being unfair to works for the sake of other works. Always.
And some people started only watching TV during Ramadhan.
He stays up watching TV, but the month meant for worship, people are with the TV.
Lighten, reduce, lessen the number of series. Lighten, let it be done over the next two years, not sooner.
Of course.
God willing, they will accept me in Ramadan.
Just God willing, I will direct all greetings to you.
God willing.
and also in the plays that
From the art of drama to the art of fashion.
A fashion show was held at the Cultural Village Katara.
Of course, we will continue with you with all love and sincerity.
And it develops the abilities and skills of children to a greater extent.
Different from the various schools present in this nation of giving.
We have a confirmed model. We talked to our guests who were with us.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Now with us is Professor Ibrahim Hussain Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning."
How are you, Omnia?
Praise be to God.
Which grade are you currently in?
Professor Ibrahim, first let's get to know what I mean by the materials that are provided through this center.
And as an example, sister Aminah.
He also went with her to observe or learn the method or style she was talking about, professor Nasima.
You feel that there has been a difference that occurred in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods...
Things were changing for his skills, his mind, even his educational level.
Scientific methods
منها ان انا في الاول في البدايه بعمل اختبار عالمي اسمه اختبار التوني تست للطفل قبل ان يبدا اي شيء اخر عندي في البرنام
I will start working on the second part of the exam. I will also work on the second part of the tonal exam.
Through it, we are able to measure the level or the level difference from the student.
He will now be tested or given quick questions in mathematics.
Omnia will calculate and answer over the air immediately.
Of course, Umniah has absolutely no idea about these questions.
We are in their domain regarding this topic.
Of course, I had another question as a beginning.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second track.
What is your participation telling us about her?
Of course, after we presented the series "Tasaneef Wahid"
Of course, praise be to God, God guided me in several roles.
Al-Ostaz Ghannam
He distributes the roles, of course, with the executing director Ashraf Shehata, and with the great professor.
Certainly, an opportunity from Tar Production Art.
Honestly, the youth's right.
Mr. Ghanem, of course, the year nominated me, perhaps.
Each episode, of course, is different.
I have some episodes where I will be doing impressions.
And conversely, this is a nice experience, of course, while working.
A pyramid among the Kuwaiti pyramids, Professor Saad Al-Faraj.
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah, Malik, Ali Al-Ghurair.
We have a saying like that among us.
Also with you is a group of young men: Abdullah, Adham.
We still have some of the young people, Abdullah Al-Asim.
This has been going on since last year, and we have been working two jobs per year.
Perhaps that's why I asked you, "Are you acting from the year ninety-seven?"
But I didn't know if the thing was achieved or if your ambition in art was achieved.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study the art, did you study it, or is it just...
Don't you take it as a talent, I...
I, the artist Abdul Aziz Jassem, clearly understand that artistic talent is a gift, a natural
From the artists who consider me, as a person, like his son.
Anything I have, I'll call.
Of course, the series, we are all with it.
We went out, worked hard, and thank God.
Now, if it were not for Tara's great appreciation to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very great thanks goes to Professor Abdulrahman.
If you compare us, as in, "in the state of Kuwait, compared to Kuwait, in the year twelve to thirteen, new actors emerge..." why is that not the case?
They have it.
Definitely, thank you very much, actually, I mean, you are giving opportunities.
Let's just say.
We are talking about the series "The Holy Names". We described it, we took an idea about it.
The lethal feeling too.
And the foot too, the foot of a man.
And we have a definite model with us, the processor, Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muweif Al-Tamimi.
Until this operation is performed live.
Let's see how we can treat the personality, for example. First, let me greet Professor Sobhi Abdullah. May God greet you.
Welcome, you are welcome. Peace and mercy of Allah be upon you.
If we start with you, professor, please go ahead.
God willing.
In the name of God, of course.
We hold hands.
Let's see the nerves.
It was as if a painting or a message from God, may He be Exalted, demonstrating the use of all the organs of your body.
What are its problems from the inside?
You might get dizzy sometimes.
Headache and dizziness
Relax your hand, relax, let your nerves be calm, yes.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover a specific type of work through his hands. Look, he is suffering from a specific illness."
The person on the left has an ear infection in the middle ear.
In the nice, what does "Hi Ish Ma'natah, Professor Abdulaziz" mean?
You have a problem with your ear.
From what am I created from a young age?
Here, he felt pain in his back.
The sinuses
The pain in the nose will give you a headache here.
I have a headache here.
This person has a problem with the sinuses.
She is the one giving him a headache between the eyes.
The weight increases without eating.
D thyroid, he has a little bit of tiredness, you have laziness and sluggishness, always a heaviness in the body.
Too much sleep
Oh, the abundance of sleep or the laziness of the body. I often feel that it is heavy.
Inflammation of the tonsils, always.
Is it possible to see the tremor? Do you notice a tremor?
He has stress and of course you, you never walk barefoot. Maybe last time.
The brother from Tunisia, huh.
Mashallah, you, you killed us with things about his presence and...
Does this massage also work for children?
Pain is truth. Mothers, glory be to God by the size of a baby's belly, the size of a baby's hand.
Not most of our children sleep, what?
When they carried him, isn't he the one who likes being carried? People think he likes being carried, but actually, he already has a belly full of gas, may God honor you.
Just what the mother gives birth to, an explanation like this simplifies the confusion.
Shall it be in the palm of the child's hand?
The hands are facing each other, the child is facing them.
Let's see, even every mom can learn, this is the movement.
Start by pressing, for example, right left right left.
This is a topic about children and it's very nice.
Okay, regarding the discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women.
It means, as we said, in every house ninety percent, mashallah, may God protect them from women.
Firstly, and as the first warning, **ceramic and level/equitable floors.**
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, our problem is that we permanently walk barefoot. It might be dangerous to walk barefoot on uneven ground.
Walk barefoot, or the guide, if the ceramic doesn't come, the problems in the houses increased.
Because the land is cold and level.
When the brooms were available, there were complaints of asthma.
It increased more.
The woman focuses on walking barefoot on the heel.
This moment, the foot, the area of the foot that is... from the back of the heel.
Here is the foot, now at the bottom of the heel.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is on its way to facilitate childbirth.
Just focus a little.
In the 7th or 9th month.
As soon as you enter your due month generally.
It means they won't come on the 8th, the 8th is dangerous and the most dangerous thing is for her to walk barefoot.
A pregnant woman should pay attention to walking barefoot.
If you enter the womb during labor.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaitan. So shake against you the trunk of the palm tree; it will cause you to fall against it, a ripe fresh cluster of dates.
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, was blessed with sustenance that would come to her.
I mean, look, even to the extent that I discussed with scholars in the field, they said, "Why has the interpretation changed?" Ibn Kathir's interpretation.
Here I am, no, I am here to give you the idea that God placed in this science and inspired me to it.
Shake your palm frond, for when the palm shakes, of course, how can it not?
As sharp as a what, they say. It's as if it were pinheads or nails.
When the palm tree shook, it gave orders to the wombs that had once been the heaviest wombs in the middle here.
The following are translations of the provided Arabic text, presented only as the translated text: **اللي هي الاحشاء عطت منا اوامر لتسهيل الولاده تعديل الجنين**
Fetal head height increases or something is adjusted immediately and the baby is born normally.
Glory be to God, as much as this fruit, this one has benefits.
Holding her hand, you begin and you guide her.
Some of them consider it a custom, and some of them know that it is indeed knowledge.
They are afraid to tell you and what you think of them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, I mean, Masha'Allah, your discoveries are important.
I just wanted to know, what's the last question, meaning how quickly did it go by?
One person would like to communicate with you, any person who would like to communicate with you, a specific email. Are you from...?
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, without any added explanations: **"Okay, here is
Of course, the numbers of Qatar Television so that they can contact us, and here is the number.
I was only created to serve people.
If we believe this belief, God will bless you in your work and make people...
Regardless of how people sin, I strive for perfection, meaning I aim for nothing that comes to mind as unnatural for a human.
Only when we aspire for good more than
Always think of the good.
Our viewers, God willing, I hope you enjoyed it as well in this paragraph, of course, through reflexology and massage through the hand.
By foot, too.
And we saw a live, on-air example of how a person with us discovered what the diseases present in him were.
And what suffering if we wish from you to provide benefit, and whoever wishes is surely able to communicate with him. He is also possibly able to read about him through the internet.
How to implement it if it's in the coming days and years, if it will include more schools.
Good morning
How can you perform this experiment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The problem of obesity in Gulf countries has become a major issue.
We feared that it was a train for the fifth state, with them.
And this program actually means it really happened that the First Lady of New York
She came, visited Doha, and they had a program for this.
They offered it to us, and we adopted it. No problem.
It means our students with New York students with students meaning Spain with students from England.
So he hollowed out until our brothers, our students in Qatar, how is their level with the world's countries? And this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage eating fruit, meaning among the students.
He stops playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week, your family meal with the family.
Of course, this is a two-bird-stone.
Certainly, the sixth week is here, saying what did he benefit from this experiment? We are today, thank God, in the conclusion.
We are happy with the students.
They found out that they were three independent boys' schools: Bainab Abu Ebaida.
Girls of Rokaya, independent.
Our morale is high.
I mean, the family is aware, their siblings got excited at home, they started eating this food like everyone else.
It became a transmissible relationship between students, and he transfers this cultural aspect even to his home, to his family.
He goes and tells them, "I am like this, they gave me, or like this, they taught me."
The training staff or the person who was giving this information to the students.
How did you choose him? How was communication established with the students? Through whom?
Yes, by God, may God reward them with good. There are indeed many entities that brought us happiness.
And we have the brothers in their education. They taught them at a diet center, they taught them about the food, meaning the healthy food too.
and learned with sister Aisha Al-Timimi etiquette etiquette eating
How do you arrange, meaning how do you eat, how do you arrange, how do you prioritize?
To teach cooking, sports, or or awareness regarding the benefits of a healthy diet.
It was in the form of separate lessons, and it was neither curricula nor
How was it possible to convey these ideas to the students?
In a varied way, some of which was within the school.
We did it at the beginning of the program, in the Aspire Zone. We gathered all the students, boys and girls.
Because this topic is not a matter for a specific individual, it is a matter for us, for all of us, because these are our children.
These students will show you how they treated them at the beginning.
So, sir, you mentioned that the results were satisfactory.
But is three schools or specific classes from these schools enough?
He is now we of course the first experiment in the world, the first time things begin, not on a large scale.
It starts on a good, reasonable scale, having all the qualities. It's a boys' club, with independent, private facilities for girls and women.
In order not to fit, for example, our culture with our environment with family circumstances, families, for example, accept things for their children that they do not accept for themselves.
Fibbon, they are really originally meaning they participate in it and it is truly important.
The student at his age of twelve years or thirteen years, this is the appropriate time, he knows about his health.
It means this is a hardship, that many people, by God, wish to be weak, but imagine it's an impossibility.
Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, formatted as requested: يعني بعض الابطال الي نشوفهم في السينما كذي و اجسامهم ضعيفه يقول هذا يعني كانه شيء خرافي لا
We spoke in detail, but there are many weeks, unfortunately we haven't been able to cover them.
Through morning Al-Duha, it is also possible to remind them of it.
And the fruits that have it, meaning Vitamin B, meaning what you can take from fruits or vegetables.
The human being knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, it means he begins to improve his health, giving him morale.
In the fruit area, they used to go to the supermarket and choose their own fruits.
This is a point, for example.
It means diversification, of course. They competed, each school excelled in its teachers with innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition, the spirit of...
We gave them the general picture and let everyone innovate.
The teachers here are the ones who used to train the students, and there isn't a special كادر for you.
We train them, we train them.
But I mean, the teachers used to add, for example, some schools like Abu Obida said we will do Saturday's activities for the students.
For example, this is a day outside of school. They decided to adopt a school named Ruqayyah. They said that it would be worth marching.
We are going to have a healthy cooking day as girls, okay, we didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking by themselves, so it was more a girl's thing, meaning they had more skill in this area.
Of course, thanks to Al Rayyan for providing all the water to the schools for free. Al Rayyan was key to this.
Of course, it means more clean water because he will need to purify his body from all these toxic substances that enter his body daily through the water.
This week we said the third.
It means, it is him, his body started moving.
He can play football or basketball, but he doesn't know that this is the sport that I love.
True, exactly right, and some of them might want other games, some of them might not want a group game.
How much is it on air directly?
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, the founder and director of the Qatari National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and welcome.
And of course, we will try our best to focus on the most important topics.
We loved that we got to know and introduce ourselves to our beloved viewers. What is the disease تصلب الاعصاب?
Because this term, perhaps a little unfamiliar to us, is also... تفضل
The number of women affected is greater than the number of men.
All currently available treatments are essentially preventive treatments.
The white blood cells, which are supposed to protect us, begin to fight us.
We are fighting them by attacking the nerve cell.
I'll make it easy for an audience that is like a electrical wire.
Covered with a layer called the wetting agent to remove it, behold, it is the nylon layer.
Certainly, it generally leads to: * **Loss of Balance** * **Diplopia (Double Vision)** * **Blurred Vision**
Leads to problems in the digestive system, the respiratory system.
Leads to madness in its worst cases, leads to quadriplegia or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions in the human body that can be severely impaired.
Or from this disease, a disease named nerve hardening.
Theories say it's his viral transmission.
He is not contagious due to illness.
And it does not transmit to children.
Some consider it a disease, depending on the region.
But for example, the equator, for instance, was completely free of this disease.
Currently we have cases on the equator affected by this disease.
This disease is still not found to have a treatment because its cause is not known.
Until now, scientists have not been able to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a treatment for it.
The current operation is an inverse operation.
They are trying to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
They are trying to start from the back, in other words.
and perhaps a little, we fear from this topic which means, we can say, perhaps this disease will come suddenly
There is a specific group that feels this disease, meaning it is spreading in a certain age group.
Here is the translation of the provided text: **"It was a globally classified entity ranging from twenty to forty years."**
Currently, the international organization for the same disease has lowered the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because he started hitting the falcon when it was about forty years old.
But it does not cure the human.
Of course, we, perhaps as a link, are open even to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, if that means through its link, the Qatari Link for Patients with Neurological Dystrophy.
What is the reason for the existence of this association?
Indeed, a very large group, which is why you thought there should be a link for this topic.
Of course, I will give you incredible numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand infected individuals.
One thousand injured.
The remaining Gulf countries have an infection rate ranging from one hundred to three hundred.
I was diagnosed around five to six years ago.
My number was either four sixty or six forty.
Are there some symptoms that show in me and that indicates to the person that indeed he has this disease?
And we don't have confirmation that it is a virus, that's why we don't want to adopt a certain theory, this is a point.
The second point is, how do I know if I am infected or not?
This is very hard.
I got lost, Mr. Abdulaziz, during an attempt, I mean, to find a specific point.
