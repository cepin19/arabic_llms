Chapter Eighteen, the choicest in the kingdom of heaven?
At that very moment, the students drew near to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the one who is favored in the kingdom of the heavens?" (Luke 22:24)
And he is crying, 'O Jesus, for a boy! Make him stand among us!'"
And he said, "I tell you the truth: unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven." Mark.
And whoever possesses humility like this child, that one is the most favored in the kingdom of heaven.
And who welcomed Walid in such a way, as I mentioned, he truly welcomes me.
And whoever falls into sins, one of these young people who believe in me, that is better for him to have a large stone of the mill hanging by his neck and to be thrown into the depths of the sea.
An ill-will upon the people of the world from matters that cause sin! Because it must happen, these matters, but oh, the ill-will of that one who causes them!
Otherwise, your hand or foot brings you into sin, cut it off and throw it at you, for it is better for you to enter into the eternal life with one hand or one foot, or to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. When
And no one will say to you, 'Here is the finest pearl for your treasury.' And no one will say to you, 'Here is a city rich in gold.' And no one will say to you, 'Here is a great nation, mighty and greatly populated.'
Do not scorn a single one of these little ones, for I tell you: their angels are in the heavens with the Father who is in the heavens.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Man, son of Adam, has come to deliver those who are lost." # 18.11 This verse is not found in many of the older manuscripts.
What do you think? If someone had one hundred sheep and one of them got lost, wouldn't they leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go look for the lost sheep?
I will tell you the truth: if he finds it, he will be happier about it than his happiness about the ninety-nine that didn't work out.
And thus, the Father in Heaven, does not even wish for one of these small ones to perish.' The sinner's brother.
«except for your brother's sin against you, go to him and quarrel with him only between you two, for if he listens to you you will have defeated your brother, Luke.**
And if he does not want to listen, take one or two with you so that every word is witnessed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Otherwise, he will not listen to them. Tell this to the people of the church. If he will not listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or some tax collector.
We tell you the truth: everything you tie to the earth will be bound in the sky, and everything you will loose on the earth will be loosed in the sky. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
And I will tell you again: if two people among you agree on the land to ask for something, it shall be granted for them, from the father who is in the heavens.
Wherever two or three people gathered in the name of my Lord, there I am present among them," an example of the unforgiving servant.
Bringing it to Jesus and asking Him, "Master, how often must I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Should it be up to seven times?"." - Luke
And Jesus said to him, «It was not only seven times, but seventy times seven times.
For this reason, it resembles the Kingdom of Heaven to a king who wanted to be reckoned with his slaves.
And when he began to settle accounts with them, they brought him a man who owed millions of silver dirhams.
And as he had nothing with which to repay him, he commanded his master to be sold, he and his wife and children and all that he possessed, in order to repay the debt that was owed against him.
And the slave prostrated himself before him and said, "Patience with me, my lord, and I will repay you for all that is owed me."
And his master, moved by his plight, freed him and allowed him to repay the debt he owed.
And when that slave went out, he found one of the slaves, his friend, who owed him one hundred silver dirhams; and he took him and hanged him and said, "Return to me that which you owe!"
And his friend fell at his feet, begging him, and said to him, "Be patient with me, and I will return what I owe you."
But he didn't want to, and he took him and threw him in prison until he could repay the debt he owed.
And when his slaves saw his friends, what happened? They were very sad and went to tell their master about all that had occurred.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **Translation:** And his master scolded him, saying to him, "Oh, this worthless slave!" For I had forgiven him the entire debt, because I had desired him. **Note:** This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original Arabic text.
So why didn't you have mercy on your friend, just as I had mercy on you?
And the lady is worried, and she prepares for him to be imprisoned so that they can torture him until he pays back what is owed.
This is how your father in heaven will do this to you. If you do not let each of you forgive every brother of yours from every heart.
CHAPTER NINETEEN JESUS TEACHES ABOUT THE DIVORCE
And when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and went into all the regions of the Jewish people, which are on this side of the Jordan River.
And they were followed by many groups of people, and he saw them there.
Bringing near to Him were the Pharisees, and they questioned Him in order to test Him: "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife, if the grounds are the same?"
And he answered them and said: "Did you not read in the Book of God that God created mankind from the beginning, male and female,
And he said: This is why the man will leave his father and mother, and will unite with his wife. They will both become one unit.
And so, there will no longer be two, but rather, they will become one's double. And what God has joined together, no human can put asunder."
And the Pharisees said to Him, "Why did Moses command, 'Let a man and his wife and a divorce decree remain before the Lord.' "
Jesus answered them, "It is because of the hardness of your hearts that Moses freed you, sending you away with your wives. But this was not how it was when God created Adam and Eve at the beginning."
I am telling you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than adultery and marries another, he is committing adultery.' متى 5:32; 1كورنتوس 7:10,11
And they said to him, his disciples: "If this is how a man is with a woman, it is better for him not to marry at all."
And Jesus answered them, "Not everyone who has the opportunity for this will accept it; only those to whom God has permitted to accept it will do so."
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Where there are people who were born from the bellies of their mothers, unable to marry, and there are those whom the people have made thus. And there are those who do not marry for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever is able to understand this, let him understand." Jesus blesses the little children.
They brought some young children to him so that he could put his hands on them and pray with them, while also disciplining the students for bringing them.
But Jesus said: "Let the little ones come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
And he put his hands on them and walked away from there. The young man who was dressed in...
And a young man came to him and said, "Teacher, what good deed can I do so that I may have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about good deeds? There is only one good, and that is God Himself. If you want to enter eternal life, do so by following the commandments."
And He questioned Him, saying, "What kind of commandments?" And Jesus answered Him, saying, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
May your father and mother be pleased, and whoever is close to you, love as you love yourself.'
He was saying to the young man, "I have done all these instructions, so what more do I need?"
Jesus answered him, "If you want to be without fault, sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven, and come, follow me!"
But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had been clothed very sumptuously.
Jesus said to his disciples: "I tell you the truth: It is difficult for a man who is well dressed to enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
And we increase to tell you: Indeed, getting a camel to enter through the eye of a needle is easier than entering with the one dressed in it for the kingdom of God!».
They were very surprised by the students when they heard this speech and said: "According to this, who will be able to survive?"
And Jesus looked upon them, and he said to them: "The people cannot do this, but God can do all things."
And Peter answered him and said, "Here we have left everything and have followed you; what will be the reward for us?"."
And he told them, "Jesus says, 'I tell you the truth: when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, at the end of this age, when all things will be made new, you will sit on twelve thrones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the thirteenth throne shall be set apart for the one who upholds all things.'"
And everyone who permitted it in his house, nor his brother, nor his sisters, nor his father, nor his mother, nor his children, nor his lands for the sake of my name, that person will have their permitted thing returned to them a hundred times and with the jealousy of a perpetual life with God.
"In many of those first, there will be the last, and many of those last will become the first." - Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter twenty, the examples of female workers in the vineyard.
The kingdoms of heaven are compared to a man who owns a vineyard; early in the morning, he went out to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He spent a dinar with them for the day and then he sent them to his orchards.
He went out around nine o'clock in the morning and found other servants standing in the market without work.
He tells them: Go, even we will go to my garden, and I will pay you with what you deserve,
They left, and he went out again around noon, and went out again at three in the afternoon, and took on other servants.
And he went out another time around the times of five in the evening, and he found other servants standing, and he said to them: Why are you standing here all day long without working?
And they answered him: Because until now, no one has served us as his master. And he told them: Then go, even you, to my garden.
And when the evening came, the owner of the garden said to his agent: Call all the servants and give them their wages, starting with the last ones until you reach the first ones.
And those he hired at five p.m. and paid each of them a dinar.
And when the first ones arrived, they thought they would be paid at a higher price, but even they only received one dinar each.
And when they were being paid, they started complaining to the owner of the land.
And they say: "Those others, they only worked for one hour, and you paid them their full salary with us, those who remained and worked the entire day in the sun."
And he is answering the owner's representative, one of them, and he said to him: I, I did not wrong you, my friend, did we not agree that for a dinar?
Here, take your right and go your own way! And this is what came in the end, I who wanted to give it to you like yourself.
Am I not allowed to spend my money as I wish? Or are you envious because I am generous?».
Jesus said, "It will be just as the last are the first, and the first are the last."" Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30
And when Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, he separated his twelve disciples from the others, saying to them on the road:
Here we are going up to Jerusalem, and there is someone who will hand over the son of a human being to the heads of the religious leaders and the scholars of the Law, and they will sentence him to death.
And they will hand him over to those who do not know God, those who will laugh at him and hit him and crucify him. On the third day, he will be sent from death." Mother of James and John, you ask Jesus for your sons.
And the mother of many, Zebedee, along with her children, came to Jesus, and prostrated themselves before Him, and asked of Him, that He might grant them a certain something.
And he asked her, "What do you want?" and she told him, "Command that my two children sit, one on your right and the other on your left in your kingdom."
And he answers Jesus: "You do not know what you are asking for, can you drink the cup of suffering that I will drink?". And they said to him: "Yes, we can!".
And he said to them: "Indeed, the juice that you will drink, I will not give it to you, because it will not be given to anyone except those for whom my father prepared it."
And when the ten students heard this speech, they were very worried for Jacob and his brother John.
Jesus called them and said, "You know that the kings of the earth control their people, and the great officials enforce their authority over everyone under them." Luke
and you complete this, this should not be between you. But whoever among you wants to be great, he should become your servant. When
And whoever wants to be first among you, he must become your servant.
And man was not born to serve men, but to serve and redeem many people with his life.' Jesus healed two blind men.
At the very moment they were leaving Jericho, Jesus was followed by a great multitude of people.
And there were two blind men sitting by the road; and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to cry out and to say, 'Have mercy on us, O Lord, O Son of David!'
And even though people argued with them to be quiet, they continued to shout more and say: "Have mercy on us, sir, Ibn Daoud!"
Jesus stood up and called out to them, asking, "What do you want me to do for you!"
And they answered him, "We want our eyes to be opened, sir!"
And Jesus took pity on them, and when he saw that their eyes were not to be seen, they began to see, and they followed him.
CHAPTER ONE TWENTY-JESUS ENTERS JERUSALEM
and as they drew near to Jerusalem and reached the area around the house of Bread of Life, which is by the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of His disciples
And he said to them: "Go to the village that is in front of you, and you will find a donkey tied up, with a dog. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if someone tells you something, you tell him: "The Lord is in need of you, and He will surely reward you quickly."
And all this happened for the words of the Prophet to come true, who said:
Here is the translation of the provided text: Tell the daughter of Zion: Your king is coming to you, humble, riding on a donkey, and a donkey's son riding behind him.
And the disciples went both ways and did what Jesus had commanded them to do.
And they brought the donkey and the female donkey, and they put their clothes on them, and Jesus rode over them.
They spread out a large group of people, their belongings on the road, and cut down other people's tree stumps and spread them out on the road.
And the groups of people who preceded Jesus and those who followed Him were crying out and saying: "Praise # 21‏:9. Praise. Literally: For the son of David to come! Blessed be the one to come in the name of the Lord! Praise be to God in the high heavens!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, all the inhabitants of the city turned against him and started saying, "Who is this man?"
And the people's groups answered them, saying, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in the Galilee." Jesus is running after the sellers and buyers from the house of God.
Jesus entered the house of God and proceeded to all those who were selling and buying there, and he overturned the tables of those who were spending money and the chairs of the sellers of pigeons.
And he said to them: "It is written in the Book of God that my house will be called the House of Prayer, but you have turned it into only a house for thieves!"
And people came to him in the house of God, people who were blind and lame, and their eyes.
But the heads of the men of religion and the learned in the law were troubled when they saw the miracles that Jesus, the Nazarene, performed, and when they heard the children crying in the house of God and saying, "Glory to the Son of David!" ".
And they said to him: "Do you hear what those people are saying?" And Jesus answered them and said: "Yes, haven't you read in God's book: From the mouths of little children and from the mouths of those who are nursing, did you bring forth for you speech of praise?"
And after he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, he stayed there. Jesus cursed the vine.
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he felt hungry.
And looking, one grapevine was on the side of the road, and he went to it and found nothing in it except the leaves. And Jesus said to it, "The fruit of the vine shall never more be within you for ever!" And at that hour the grapevine was dried up.
And when the students saw what happened, they were surprised and said: "How did the vine dry up so quickly?"
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And while answering them, Jesus said: 'I tell you the truth: if you have faith without any doubt, you will not simply do the things I did for the vineyard, but you will do even what I said.' (Matthew 12:37)"
And all that you ask for in prayer with faith, you shall receive." Who gave authority to Jesus?
And when Jesus, the Nazarene, came into the house of God teaching, the leaders of the people, the elders of the scriptures, and the Pharisees sat down before him. And they said, "Teacher, we know you are a teacher from God, and your authority comes from God. Who gave you this authority?"
And Jesus answered them and said to them: "Even I want to ask you one question; if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things:"
From where did the baptism of John come? From God or from the people?». And they consulted with each other and said: "If we say it came from God, He will tell us: Why didn't you believe in John?"
And if we say it came from the people, we fear the people because they consider John a prophet.
They answer Jesus, and they say to him, "We do not know him." And he says to them, "Neither do I say to you, 'In what capacity I do this thing'." The saying of two boys
What seemed good to you about a man who had two sons, and went to the first son and said to him, "Go my son and work today in the vineyard of mine."
And his son answered him and said to him: I don't want to. But he regretted in the end, went away.
The master went to the boy and said to him just as he said to the first, and he answered him and said: Very well, sir! But he did not leave.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **"Well, who out of these two did Mourad's father do?" And they were saying to Him, 'The first.' And He said to them, 'I tell you the truth, that it is the tax collectors and the corrupt officials who will precede you into the Kingdom of God.'"
Here is the translation of the provided text: "For this reason, John [21:32] intended here is John the Baptist. He came to you following the path of truth, and you did not believe in it. However, the tax collectors and corrupt officials believed in it. Even after you saw this, you did not regret it and you did not believe in it." Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parable of the vineyard and the gardener.
Here is the translation of the provided text: Here is a man who owned land. He planted a vineyard, and he enclosed it with a wall. He dug a press into it, and he built a tower. He rented it to an orchardist, and he traveled.
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the vineyards to take their harvest.
The gardeners rose up, seized the slaves, and beat one, killing another, and stoning another with stones.
And he again sent other slaves in greater numbers than the first, and the gardeners did for them as they had done for the others.
And in the end, he sent his son to them and said, "My son will be respected."
But when they saw the gardeners, the son of the owner of the garden, they said among themselves: This is the one who is going to inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!
They pulled him out and killed him outside the vineyard.
So, if the winemaker comes, what should he do for those gardeners?
And they will answer him: "Those riffraff, their end will be a terrible thing, and the vineyard of grapes will go to other gardeners who will give the harvest on time."
And Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Book of God: The stone which the builders did not want, this it became, the stone of the foundation? This thing came from the Lord, and it is a thing wonderful in our eyes!"
For this reason I say to you: the kingdom of God will be taken away from your hands, and given to a people that produces its fruit.
Behind him, whoever falls on this stone will be crushed to pieces, and whoever the stone falls on will be trampled to death.'
And when the heads of the religious authorities and the Pharisees who were in authority heard them, they understood that over them these words were being spoken.
and they started looking for ways to capture him, but they were afraid of the groups of people because they considered him a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-Two, The Guests' Wedding Entertainment Program.
And Jesus spoke again to the woman by the well, after he had spoken to the crowd; and he said:
It resembles the kingdom of heaven to one sovereign who arranged a wedding for his son.
He then sent his slaves to summon those who were offered, but they refused to come.
And he sent again other servants and said to them: Tell the invitees: I have prepared the wedding and I have slaughtered the fat bulls and cows, everything is ready, well then come to the wedding!
But they didn't care about it; some of them went out to their feddans, and others went to sell and buy.
And others among those on display seized his slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
And the king was worried, and he sent his army, and these murderers were destroyed, and their city was burned.
He was saying to his slaves: The wedding is here, but those whom we invited are not worthy.
Let's go now to where the roads meet and offer to every one you find for the wedding.
And the slaves went out onto the roads and gathered everything they found, both the good people and the bad, until the wedding house was filled with guests.
And when the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing the clothes of a wedding.
He was telling him: How did you, my friend, manage to get in here when you are not wearing the clothes of the wedding? And the man was silent because he had nothing to say.
He says to the king, "Deliver up to the servants the king's children." He says, "Seal up from the hands and feet of the children, and throw them out and away into darkness outside, and there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. When
Where more people were exposed but fewer were chosen. The tax collection for the Tsar.
And the Pharisees went away at that time, discussing among themselves how they might seize upon some fault in Jesus's words.
And they send him their students, along with the Herodians, and told him, "Master, we know that you are honest, and you teach the way of God truly, and you do not turn a blind eye to things, because you do not care about a person's status."
Yes, tell us what comes to your mind? Is it permissible for us to pay the tax to the Tsar or not?
And Jesus knew their hypocrisy, and He told them, "Why do you test me, O hypocrites?"
Show me the money, how do you pay the tax!'. And they brought him a dinar.
And he whispered to them: "This picture and these writings on the money, belong to whom?"
They said to him: "It is Caesar's." And he said to them: "Well, what is Caesar's, give it to Caesar; and what is God's, give it to God!"
And when they heard him, they were astonished, and left him and went away. The question is about the sending of the dead.
And by your daylight they came to Jesus, some Pharisees who were theologians and considered themselves the expositors of the divine law, who asserted with great boldness that the resurrection of the dead was an illusion, and they questioned Him, saying: What do you say about the works of the Law?
Sir, Mosis said: If a man dies and does not have children, his brother must marry his wife so that they may have children, with the name of his brother.
We had seven brothers among us. The first of them got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother so that his brother could marry her.
And so it happened to the second, to the third, even to the seventh.
And in the end, after they all died, the woman died too.
Who among these seven will be a man to this woman on the day of judgment? Because they were all her men.'
Jesus answered them and said, "You are mistaken, for you do not know either the Book of God or the power of God."
For on that Day of Resurrection, the people shall not marry and shall not be given in marriage, but shall be like the angels in heaven.
As for the question of the sending of the dead, have you not read the words of God to you when He said:
I am He, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not a god of the dead, but a God of the living." الشرح: The translation accurately reflects the content and nuances of the original Arabic text.

And when the people heard these words from him, they were astonished at his learning. The Great Commandment.
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, who was a learned scholar of the Law, asked Jesus to test him and said:
Mr. sir, what is the big command in Sharia?
Jesus answered him and said, "Do you want to worship the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind?"
This is the great and primary command.
And the second will as it is: You want the one close to you as you want yourself.
The two testaments, these are the foundations of all the law, and the writings of the prophets." Luke 10:25-28: Christ and the prophet David.
And when the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus asked them and said:
What do you say about Christ? Born of whom is he? And they said to him, "He was born of David!"
And he asks them: "Well, how did David receive the revelation from the Spirit of God? God called him when he said:"
The Lord said to His son: Sit on my right side until I destroy your enemies under your feet.
Yes, if David is calling out to the Messiah, my Lord, how can the Messiah be His son?».
And no one was able to answer him with a word, or for anyone to dare to ask him more questions from that day on.
CHAPTER Twenty-three Jesus commands his disciples to beware of religious leaders, the Pharisees.
Jesus spoke with the crowds of people and with his disciples,
And he said, "The scholars of religious law and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses."
All that they tell you, do with it and follow it, but do not do their deeds because they do not do what they say.
They tie heavy and difficult loads for lifting, placing them on people's shoulders, but they do not even move a finger to lift them along with them.
or they do something they only do so that people can see them, and they expand the gangs on their arms and on their foreheads, and they lengthen their cloaks,
And they want to be in the best places in the concerts, and in the first places in the prayer houses,
And they like to greet them, people in the market, and call out to them: "Sir."
But you keep crying to them: Oh my master, for you are all brothers and have one master.
And what you call a father in this world, you do not have, for you have one Father, who is the Father in Heaven.
And do not let anyone cry to you: 'Oh teacher,' for you have one teacher, Christ.
And the eldest among you, in particular, should be the one who serves you.
Let him who exalts his glory find him to have fallen; and let him who humbles himself to the greatness of his glory find him to have been exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe to you, sons of the scholars of the Law and the Pharisees, hypocrites! Woe because you shut the Kingdom of Heaven in the face of people; you, who enter; and you, who leave, those who wish to enter, let them enter.

O woe to you, O scholars of the Law, and the Pharisees, the hypocrites!

O Jerusalem, O city that kills the prophets and mistreats the messengers sent to it! How often I wished to gather together your sons, as one gathers a chicken within its flocks, beneath its winglets. But you did not want this.
Here is your home, it will remain for you as a ruin.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR JESUS PREDICTS THAT THE House of God Will Be Destroyed
Jesus went out and walked to the place of God, and they came to him, his disciples, in order that he might show them the construction of the place of God.
And He said to them, "Jesus said to you, 'Have you seen all this? I tell you the truth, there will not remain here a stone upon a stone, unless it shall be removed.'" Signs of the End Times
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him, and they questioned him among themselves, saying: "Tell us, teacher, when will these things take place? And what will be the sign of your coming, and the coming of the end of the ages?"."
And answering them, Jesus said: "Be careful that no one misleads you!"
Because many people will come, they will take my name, and they will say, "I am the Christ!" and many people will be mistaken.
You will hear about war and the news of war, and be not frightened! For all this must come to pass, but it will not be this that ends all time.
For the invaded will rise up against the invaders, and kingdoms against kingdoms, and there will be famine, and earthquakes will strike in many places.
But all this is just the initial throes.
At that time, they will hand you over to those who will torture you, kill you, and the peoples of the world will all hate you because of the name I bear. متى
And at that time, many people will return to their faith and sell each other, hating each other.
Many false prophets will appear, and many people will be misled.
And with the abundance of sins, the love of many people will be consumed.
But what remained was firm until the very end, that is a victory. When
And the good news will be proclaimed concerning the kingdom of God in this entire world; and it will be a testimony to all the peoples of the earth; and at that time the last of times will come, the great suffering." The Great Affliction
And when you see it in the holy place, the abomination of destruction spoken of by the Prophet Daniel—(He that reads understanding!)
When the hour comes in the Land of Israel, the people flee to the mountains, when the hour comes in the Land of Israel, the people flee to the mountains,
And the one who is on the roof will not come down to take what is in his house. -Luka
And what was in the plot does not return to take his clothes.
Oh, woe to the pregnant women and to the women who were nursing during those days.
Pray so that you do not flee in the winter or on a Saturday.
May time deceive you, for a great calamity is about to occur, the likes of which have never been seen since God created the world until now, and it will never again be seen after this. The Vision
And because God did not shorten those days, everyone would have survived from the human perspective, but because of those whom God chose for those days, it will be shortened.
And at that very moment, someone told you: Here is the Christ, or perhaps he is over there! Do not believe them,
Whereas people will arise who will lie and say, 'We are Christ,' and other people, 'We are the prophets,' and they will perform signs, remarkable things, in order to deceive, if possible, even those whom God has chosen. الشرح: This is a direct, word-for-word translation.

Who is the faithful, wise servant whom his master has appointed over the household slaves to provide them with nourishment in a timely manner?
That slave, when his master comes and finds him doing the work his master had instructed him to do.
We tell you the truth: he is going to pay for it with everything he owns.
Either that, or that slave was ugly and thought to himself: My master will be delayed on his return.
And he began to hit his friends, the slaves, and to eat and drink with the drunkards.

And He will severely punish him and place him among the hypocrites. Then, 'He will weep and gritty teeth will chatter.'
Chapter twenty-five, The Examples of Ten for Bachelors
And the time will come when the kingdom of heaven will be like ten single women, taking their lamps, and going out to meet the bridegroom. Luke
And five of them were simple, and five others were rational.
They swung those five candelabra, taking no extra oil with them.
As for the five intelligent women, they took their own candles and oil and placed them there.
And when the groom's malfunction started, all the single women started kissing until they fell asleep.
And in the middle of the night, you hear a loud voice saying: Here is the groom, come out so you can meet him!
And they will awaken all the unmarried women, and they have prepared their torches.
And they said to the foolish and the reasonable, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
But the intelligent ones answered them and said, "He might not be enough for us and you. Go and buy it from the one who sells it."
And as they were going to buy oil, the groom came, and those present with the bride went in with them. Those who were present for the wedding ceremony and who had the door locked, went in with them.
And afterwards the other unmarried girls returned, saying: "Oh sir, oh sir, open for us!" (Luka)
But the groom answered them and said: In fact, I do not know you.
Indeed, because of this, they stayed up late, because you don't know either the day or the hour [when the human being will be born] # 25‏.13 The end of this verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts.
And it is like a kingdom of heaven to a man who was going to travel, and he called his slaves and charged them with his money, for Luke. The parable of the talents
And he gave one man five bags of money, and to the second he gave two, and to the third he gave one bag, each in accordance with his effort, as he traveled.
And that man who took five bags of money and started buying and selling with them, and made a profit of five more bags of money.
And that one who took two of the bags also won two more bags.
As for the one who took a single bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the bag that his master had given him in it.
After a long period of time, the master of those slaves returned and settled accounts with them.
And he comes to him, the one who took five small bags and paid with them five other small bags, and he says: "Sire, you gave me five small bags. Well, here are the other five you won, plus a little something extra."
And he said to his master: I have nothing to ask of you, for you are a good and trustworthy slave! I was trustworthy with you in small matters, and now I will task you with greater matters, come then and rejoice with your master.
And then, someone came who took two bags of coins as well and said: "Master, you gave me two bags of coins, here, take with them two more which I won additionally."
And his master said to him: I have nothing to demand from you, for you are a good and honest servant! I have been honest with you in small matters, and now I will task you with greater matters, come then and rejoice with your master.
And after that, the one who took a single bag also came to him and said, "Sir, I know that you are a harsh man. You harvest what you did not plant and you gather what you did not sow."
And for this, I was afraid and went and hid your money in the ground, and now here is your livelihood.
And his master answered him, and he said to him: Woe to you! You are a wicked, talkative, and boastful slave! After you recognized me, I was harvesting what I had not planted, and I was gathering what I had not gathered!
If you had put my money with the money traders, so that when I return I could take it back along with its profit.

And after that, the king will say to those on his right: Come, you who are blessed by your father! You have inherited the kingdom of God that He has prepared for you from the time the world was created.
When I was hungry and you fed me, When I was thirsty and you gave me to drink, When I was a stranger and you hosted me, In every good deed that you bestowed upon me.
Naked and clothed, sick and visited, in prison and came to me.
At that hour, those who caused God's will to be and say: "Oh Lord, when have we seen You hungry and given You? Or thirsty and quenched You?"
And when did we see you, strange, and hosting you? Or naked, and we clothed you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison, and come to you?
And the king will answer them, and will say to them: I will tell you the truth: Every time you did this to someone from these my brothers, who are of a smaller stature, you did it for me!
And he will also say to those on his left: Get away from me, you accursed ones, into eternal fire, which has been prepared for Satan and for the angels who are with him,
because I got hungry and you didn't feed me, and I got thirsty and you didn't give me a drink,
And I was a stranger, not befriended, naked, not clothed, sick, imprisoned, and none of you came to me.
And at that moment, they will answer him, and they will say: Oh Lord! When did we see You, hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or imprisoned, and You did not help Us?
And the king will answer them and say: I will tell you the truth: because you did not do this for those who are of a lower status, you did not do it for me.
Those who will go to the lasting torment, and those whose deeds are the will of Allah, will go to eternal life.'
CHAPTER Twenty-six FOR THE JEWISH CHIEFS ARE DEBATING IN ORDER TO KILL JESUS
And when Jesus had finished saying all these words, he said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter will be from now in two days, and the Son of Man will be delivered by the people for him to be crucified.
Time was honored as the chief ruler, with the Sanhedrin, the religious council, and the leading men of the people gathered in the Home of Agavah, the chief of the religious leaders, having come to give ear to the words of the law.
They consulted with each other to seize Jesus by deception and kill him.
But they said: «We will not do this on the festival, so that no confusion or disorder arises among the people.» The woman who poured perfume on Jesus
and Jesus was in the house of Bread of Agape, in the house of Simon the Tanner,
A woman came close to him, having a bottle of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head while he was sitting by the table with food.
And when his students saw what she did, they were not pleased and said: "Why this waste?"
For this scent was capable of being sold at a very high price, its proceeds to be distributed among the poor.'
And when Jesus saw what they were doing to Mary, he said to them, "Why do you give yourselves to such worthless talk as this, amongst yourselves? Know this, I have done no wrong to any of you."
Where the poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
And when these sisters smell this scent on my person, they perfume me in order to prepare me for the grave.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "We will tell you the truth: wherever people report this good news throughout the entire world, they will talk about this thing that this woman has done and they will remember her." "Judas the traitor agrees to hand over Jesus."
Time was of the essence, a crucial point to remember. One of the twelve students you referred to as "Yehuda HaMeshiach" (Judas the Messiah), proceeded to the heads of the religious establishment.
And he said to them: "What will you give me if I hand you over to me?" And they agreed with him for thirty pieces of silver.
Since then, the Jews have been searching for the meal at which Jesus will be handed over. The Passover meal with the disciples
On the very first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you the meal on the Festival of Passover that you will eat?"
And he answered them and said: "Go to the city to a certain someone, and tell him: 'As our master tells you: my clock is about to strike, and I am going to come by to spend Easter with you and my pupils.'".
And they took the disciples as he had instructed and found for the Easter Feast.
And when the time for supper drew near, Jesus sat down at the table to eat with the twelve disciples.
While they were having dinner, he told them, "I'll tell you the truth. One of you will hand me over to the authorities."
And the students were very sad, and each of them began asking him: "Am I, sir?"
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "And he answered them and said: 'Those who are with me, let their hand be in the dish, that is the one who will hand me over!'"
Indeed, the son of man will die as it is written for him in the Book of God. But woe to that man who will deliver up the son of man. It would have been better for him if he had never been born.
And he questioned him, saying, "Sayeth thou, 'I am he'"? And Jesus answered him, saying, "Thou hast said it." And he prepared a meal, a dish of the Lord.
And when they were eating, Jesus took the bread, thanked God, broke it, and then gave it to his disciples and said, "Take, eat. This is the body of my servant, written about me."
And thereafter he took the cup, thanked God, gave them, and said, "Drink from it, all of you."
For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant which will flow for the sake of many people so that their sins may be forgiven.
And I tell you: From today I will not drink from this grape juice again until the day comes when I will drink it with you anew in the kingdom of 'Pa'.
After that, they praised God and went out, going to the Mount of Olives. Jesus prophesied that Peter would deny him.
And He said to them, "Jesus says, 'In this night you will be receiving your departure from all of you, for it is written in the Book of God: I will strike the release, and the scattering will be the sheep of the portion of the flock.'"
But after being resurrected from death, I will get there before you to the Galilee.' متى
And Peter answered him and said to him, "Even if they all accuse you, I will never doubt you!"."
And Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth: before this night passes, and before the cock crows, you will have me three times." الشرح: This response provides a direct, complete, and accurate translation of the given text, without any additional explanations.
And Peter answered him, "Even if I should know that I'm dying with you, I will not repudiate you!". And this is what all the disciples said to him. Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Hereby is the translation of the provided text into English, formatted as requested: وفداك الوقت جا يسوع مع التلامد دياله لواحد الجنان سميته جتسيماني، وݣال ليهم: «ݣلسو هنا بينما نمشي نصلي تم!».
After this, he was joined by Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and he began to feel overwhelmed by sadness and despair.
He was telling them: "My soul is deeply saddened to the point of death. Stay here and keep vigil with me!"
And after a while upon them, he prostrated himself and began to pray, saying: "Ah, father! If it is possible, remove this trial from me. But not as I wished, but as you wished."
And afterwards he returned to the students and found them asleep, and he said to Peter: "Couldn't you stay up with me for even just one hour?"
They stayed up and prayed so that they would not fall into temptation; the spirit is strong, but the self is weak.'
And as he walked for the second time, he prayed and said: "Oh father! If it wasn't possible for him, this trial would pass away from me without me tasting it, then it must be your will." And he said: "And as he walked for the second time, he prayed and said: 'Oh father! If it wasn't possible for him, this trial would pass away from me without me tasting it, then it must be your will.'" And he said: "And he said:"
And he returned again and found them sleeping, as sleep overcame them.
And he left them and went away again, and he prayed for the third time, and he repeated the same words.
He then came to his students and said to them: «Are you still sleeping and resting! Look at how close the hour is and how the son of man will be handed over to the hands of the condemned,
Let's go! Here comes the one who will hand me over. Jesus is being arrested.
And as Jesus continued to speak, one of the twelve disciples, with a large group of others armed with swords and daggers, sent by the religious authorities and elders of the people.
And those who handed him over had given them a sign, saying to them: "The man we are going to kiss is precisely that one, seize him!"
And at that time, near Jesus, was Yohosh. And he said to him, "Peace be to you, Lord!" And he kissed him.
And he was saying to him Jesus, "Why did you come, my friend?" And as they approached Jesus, they reached out and grabbed him.
One of those who was with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword. He struck the servant of the chief religious leader, as he was cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, «Return your sword to its sheath! For all those who serve the sword will die by the sword.'
Do you think that I am not capable of calling now my father and he will send me more than eleven company's of the soldiers of the angels?
But how will the words in the Book of God, which state that this is to be as it is described, be verified?
Jesus said to the crowds: "Why do you come bearing swords and sticks, to seize me as a common thief? For I was with you every day, and I taught in the Temple; and you did not capture me!" (Luke)
But all this took place to fulfill what was written by the prophet.' And at that time, they permitted all who were taught by him to leave. Jesus stood in the Jewish tribunal.
But those who seized Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, together with the religious scholars and elders who were gathered in the sanctuary.
And Peter followed him from afar, even to the house of the head of the laity, and he went in and sat with the servants in order to see what would happen in the end.
The following is a translation of the provided text into English, focusing on accuracy and natural flow: "And the heads of the men of the religious, and the elders of the court, they searched for some false witness testimony against Jesus, that he might be killed, ["]."
But they didn't find it, even though many false witnesses came. In the end, two witnesses were presented.
And they say: "This man says: I can tear down the temple of God, and I will build the days of sacrifice." John
And rising, he made the head of the men of the religious profession, and he asked Jesus: "Will you in all things be made to answer for what is said against you by these men?"
But Jesus remained silent, and he said to the high priest: "I tell you by the living God, if you do not tell us, whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God?"."
Jesus answered him, "You have spoken it! But I will say more: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand, glorified and seated above the heavens!"
And at that moment, the head of the men of religion spoke, saying: "This is blasphemy! We no longer have anything to do with witnesses. Here, you have heard his words of blasphemy."
Here is the translation of the provided text into
They spit on his face, beat him, and some of them slap him.
And they said: "Come, foretell us, O Christ, who hath smitten thee?"." Peter, answering, said, "Lord, I know not what to say."
And Peter was sitting outside, in the courtyard of the house, and a servant came to him and said to him: "Even you were with Jesus who was from Galilee!".
He denied in front of all those present and said: "I don't know what you are saying!"
And after that, he went to the entrance of the house, and another servant saw him and told those who were there: "Even this one was with Jesus the Nazarene!".
And Peter again denied, calling an oath, and saying: "I know not this man!"
And after a while, those who were standing there came and said to Peter: "Undoubtedly, you are one of us, because your appearance and your speech are those of our people!"
And he began to curse and swear and say: "I don't know this man at all!." And at that moment, the rooster called.
Peter thought about the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times." As Peter went outside, he wept profusely.
Chapter Twenty-seven
And early in the morning, the religious leaders and the elders of the people all agreed to kill Jesus.
They bound his hands and took him to the ruler, Pilate. Judas Iscariot had his head cut off.
And at that moment, when he saw Yehuda, the one who betrayed him, he judged Jesus. He repented and restored thirty pieces of silver to the heads of the religious leaders, the elders, and the priests.
And he said to them: "I have sinned because I handed over someone who had no sin." And they said to him: "It is not our concern, deal with yourself."
And Judah threw the money-chest into the house of God, and afterward he went and hanged himself.
And they took the heads of the men of religion, and the silver, and they said: "It is not permissible for us to put them in the chest of the House of God, for indeed they are the price of human blood."
They agreed to use it to buy an earthenware fard, and to turn it into a garden for foreigners,
And for that reason, people call this feddan, feddan of blood, until today.
And at that time, it will achieve what has been revealed to the Prophet Jeremiah. When it says: "Take thirty pieces of silver, the agreed-upon price for one piece..."
And for this price they bought the field of the potter, as the Lord had instructed him." Jesus was brought before the ruler, Pilate.
Jesus stood before the ruler, who questioned him, saying: "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered him: "You have said it."
And when the heads of the clergy and the elders accused him, he would not answer them with anything.
And Pilatus said to him, "Haven't you heard all that witnesses testifying against you?"
And Jesus did not answer him a single word, and for that, the governor was very much surprised.
And the custom was when the ruler, for every Easter, would release one of the imprisoned people whom the people desired.
And they had, at that time, one prisoner who was famous; his name was Yeshua Barabbas.
And when the people were gathered, Pilatus asked them, "Of whom do you want me to release, Jesus called Christ, or the other, Joshua's son, Barabbas?"
For it was Pilate who knew that out of their envy they had presented Jesus to Him.
And while Pilate was sitting on the chair of judgment, his wife sent for him to say: "Take care not to harm this man who has committed no offense, for I suffered greatly today in a dream of his."
But the heads of the people, the religious leaders, and the elders incited the crowds of people to ask Pilate to release Barabbas to them and to kill Jesus.
And Pilate asked them, "Of these two men, which one do you want me to release?" And they replied, "Barabbas."
And he was telling them, Pilate was saying to them: "So, what should I do with Jesus, the one they call the Christ?" And they all answered him: "Put him to death!"
And he said to them, "What evil has he done?" but they increased in their cries to him and they said to him, "Crucify him!"
And when Pilatus saw that nothing was of any avail to them, and that the people were growing ever more restless, he took the water and washed his hands before the assembled multitude, and he said, "I, for my part, declare that the blood of this man shall be on my hands; you, meanwhile, deal with him according to your own understanding!"
And the entire people answered him, and he said: "Just let his blood be upon us and upon our children!"
At that time, Barabbas was released for them, but Jesus handed him over to be crucified, after they had scourged him. The soldiers were laughing at Jesus.
And the army of the ruler Jesus went to the palace of the ruler, and they gathered a whole company of soldiers against him.
And they clothed him in a red shawl.
They placed a crown of thorns on his head, and they put a reed in his right hand. They began to kneel before him, laughing at him, and saying: "Peace be upon you, O king of the Jews!".
They spat on him, took his cane, and hit him with it on his head.
After they had mocked him, they took away his mantle and clothed him in his own clothes, and took him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified.
And when they were taking him out of the city, they met a man from Kairouan named Simon, who insisted that he take the cross of Jesus.
They came to the place which I named the Place of Skulls, meaning the place of the skulls.
They gave him to drink wine mixed with a herb called 'Almer', and when he tasted it, he did not want to drink it.
They nailed him to a cross and divided his clothes between them after they had beaten him to death.
And they remained sitting there, watching over him.
And they put a sign over his head, written in it was his accusation: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
And at that moment, they joined forces with two robbers, one on their right and the other on their left.
And the people passing by would jeer him, turning their heads.
And they say: "O you who will surely tear down the House of God and then rebuild it in three days,
The heads of the religious leaders, the scholars of Islamic law, and the sheikhs were also laughing at him and saying:
Others were saved, but he could not save himself! If he was the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now so we may believe in him!
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: Indeed, he relies on God! Well, may He deliver him now, if He wills, because as he said: 'I am the son of God!'.'
Even the thieves crucified with him taunted him, just like the others. The death of Jesus
And darkness fell upon the entire country from one o'clock in the afternoon until three o'clock in the evening.
At about the third hour of the afternoon, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
and some of those who were standing there heard him and said, "He is calling for Elijah."
One of them ran and took a piece of cloth, sprinkled it with vinegar, put it on the head of a reed, and handed it to him to drink.
And they used to tell him: "Leave him until we see if the Messiah will come to save him!"
Jesus groaned again, this time in a loud voice, and died.
And the covering of the qibla of the House of God was torn in two, from the top to the bottom. And the earth quaked and the rock split.
And the graves shall be sweet, and ye shall send forth many holy ones from death,
They came forth from the tombs, after having been raised by Jesus from death, and entered into Jerusalem the holy city, and appeared to many people.
And when the commander of the army and the watchmen who watched with him fell on their knees before Jesus, they saw the earthquake and all that had occurred, and they were very frightened and said, "In truth, this man was the Son of God."
And there were many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, and these women were also rebuked, as they went by and watched. Luke
Among them was Miriam المجدلية, and Miriam the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial place of Jesus.
In the evening, a man dressed in fine clothes from Ramla, named Joseph, came. He, too, was a disciple of Jesus.
And this man entered and made his way toward the Governor, Pilate, and asked him to give him the papers of Jesus. And at that time, Pilate gave the papers to him.
And Joseph took the linen, and wrapped it up, and covered it.
And he put it in the new grave that he had dug in the rock, and he replaced a large stone over the door of the grave and he left.
And it was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb, guarding the tomb.
And the next day, which was the day after the day they were preparing for the Sabbath, the leaders of the religious authorities and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate.
And they said to him: "Remember us, my master, that when that liar was alive, he used to say that after three days he would be sent. When..."
Here is the translation of the provided text: Yes, give your command to be present at the grave until the third day, so that the students of his will not come at night to steal him and tell the people: 'He followed from death!' and that this last lie will be worse than the first.'
And he was saying to them, Pilate, "You have soldiers, so go and do the guard duty for the tomb as you please."
They went and lit the stone of the tomb and put watchmen around it.
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT JESUS WAS SENT FROM DEATH
And when Saturday was over and the dawn of Sunday had come, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
A strong earthquake suddenly occurred, where the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and harnessed the stone that was over the door of the tomb and sat on it.
He was a figure of light, like a flash of lightning, and his garments were white, like snow.
And the watchmen tremble with fear and become like the dead.
But the angel said to the women together: "Fear not! I know that you are looking for Jesus, who has been crucified,
He is not here, because he followed from death as he said. Come and see the place where he was placed.
Go quickly and tell the students that he is one who followed from death, and will precede you to the Most High, where you will see him. Be it as I have told you."
The women came out in a hurry from the grave, fearing and overjoyed very much, and they went running so as to bring the news to his students.
And he met with them, Jesus by chance, and he said to them, "Peace be to you!" And they approached him, and they stretched out their hands to his feet, and they bowed down to him.
And Jesus said to them, "Be not afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; for it is there I will be seen by them." And the watchmen are telling about what happened.
And when the women were leaving, some of the guards from the tomb went to the city and informed the heads of the clergy about everything that had happened.
They gathered with the sheikhs, consulted with them about this, and bribed the soldiers with large amounts of money.
And they said to them: «Say that the students of his came at night, stole it, and we were sleeping,
Or the governor will send the news, we are going to convince him and nothing bad will happen to you.**
And they took the guards' money and did as they were instructed. This report spread among the Jews until today. Jesus assigned his disciples.
As for the disciples of Jesus, they went to Galilee, to the mountain, just as Jesus had instructed them.
And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves before him, but some of them had doubts.
and Jesus approached them and spoke with them, saying: "The Lord has given me all authority in heaven and on earth,
Go and do this for all the peoples of the earth: baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to do with all that which I have commanded you, and here I am with you for all the days, even to the end of time.'
Chapter One John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
This is the gospel of the good news of the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the book of the Prophet Isaiah:
A voice resounded in the desert, saying: "Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your path."
And thus John came to the wilderness, baptizing the baptized and bringing the good news of the baptism of repentance, so that God might forgive their sins. And they found the way of the Lord, and they led His ways.'
And all the people of the land of Judah, and the people of Jerusalem, came to him, and they laid their burdens on his shoulders, and they came to the river Jordan, and they laid out before him their guilt.
John used to dress in garments made of camel hair, which were worn with leather belts, and he would eat insects and pure honey.
And he used to tell people, saying: "One will come after me who is stronger than me, and I do not deserve to be bowed down to, even to loosen the laces of his boots for him."
I baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." John baptizes Jesus
And it came to pass, that Jesus, the Son of God, from Nazareth in the province of Galilee, was baptized by John the Baptist at the Jordan River.
And at that very moment when he came out of the water, he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descend upon him in the form of a dove.
and you hear a voice from the heavens saying: "You are my beloved son, in whom I have been overjoyed." Matthew 3:17; Mark 12:18; Luke 3:22 Satan tempts Jesus
May the time be your ransom, and the Spirit of God, Jesus, be sent to the wilderness.
And it remained so for forty days, and the devil tested him throughout this period. And the beasts were surrounding him, and the angels were mocking him. Jesus preached in Galilee.
And after John was bound in prison, Jesus came to the region of Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God,
And he said, "This is the time that is full, and the kingdom of God is drawing near, so let us turn from this and be saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
And Jesus, while he was walking along the sea, which he called the Sea of Galilee, saw Simon (the brother of James) and Andrew (the brother of Peter) mending their nets in the sea, because they were fishermen.
And he was saying to them Jesus: "Follow me, and I will restore you as fishermen of people."
And at that moment they left their window and followed him.
And something a little more occurred, and he saw Jacob, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat, as they were repairing their nets.
Jesus called out to them, and they left their father, Zebedee, with the disciples, and boarded the boat, following him. Jesus cast out a man possessed by an unclean spirit.
They went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath was reached, Jesus went to the house of prayer and began to teach.
People were astonished by his education, for he taught them as someone with authority, not as the scholars of religious law. متى
A man, possessed by a jinn, began to scream in the prayer hall.
And he says: «What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: you are the holy one of God!».
Jesus stood up and went out to the dry place. And he said to him, "Be quiet, and get out of the man!"."
And the jinn brought the man down to the ground, and he began to writhe, and the jinn cried out with great force and left him.
And the people were filled with awe, and they began to ask one another, "What is this? This is a new form of instruction, one that he imparts with absolute authority, even to the point of compelling madness to obey his commands!"
And suddenly, the news of Jesus spread throughout every region of Galilee. Jesus was healing his relative Peter and many other people.
And as Jesus went out, he went out with Jacob and John from the house of prayer. As they walked to the house of Simon, they met Andrew.
And Nadia, the sister of Simon, was lying on the bed because she had a fever, and they were telling Jesus about her.
And he approached her, pulled her by her hand, and she rose. And the fever left her, and she offered them food.
That evening, when the sun set, the people brought Jesus all the sick and those possessed by demons.
And all the people of the city had gathered by the gate.
Jesus healed many patients of various diseases, and He drove out of people many a madness, and He left not the المجنون to speak, knowing him. Jesus teaches.
And Jesus rose early, before it was light, and went out to a deserted place, and there he began to pray.
And Simon and those who were with him began to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him: "Indeed, everyone is looking for you!"."
And he was saying to them, Jesus says: "Let us go to the towns that are nearby so that I may proclaim the good news also there, for that reason I have come."
He walked to tell the good news in their prayer houses, and to drive out the demons into all the corners of the accursed land. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus heals a man who is paralyzed.
And one of the men, Jairus, a wealthy man, fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, "Master, if you want, you can make me clean."
And he yearned for him, extended his hand, touched him, and said to him: "I want, so be pure!"
And at that moment, the grandfather would remove the front part of his body and become pure.
Jesus forbade him very much not to tell the people, and sent him away, and said unto him:
Be careful not to say anything to anyone! But go and show your body to the holy man and pay for your cleansing of what Moses instructed, to be a testimony for them.
But that man went out and began telling people about all that had gone on, and how he had delivered this news, to the extent that Jesus was no longer able to enter a city before the people, but remained outside in the open places. And people came to him from all directions.
Chapter Two: Jesus heals a paralyzed man.
Some time later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the people heard that he was there.
And a large crowd gathered, so much so that there was no space left in front of the door. And he began to teach them the word of God.
And they brought a man who was paralyzed, and four men were carrying him.
And when they could not approach him with the force of the crowd of people, they stripped the roof above the place where he was sitting, and they cut an opening in it, and they lowered the bed on which the paralyzed person was sleeping.
And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, I swear to you that your sins have been forgiven!"
And they were sitting there, some scholars of religious law, and they thought to themselves:
«Why is this man speaking and saying blasphemous words? Who can forgive sins but God alone?».
And quickly Jesus knew, by the Spirit of God, what they were speaking to themselves, and he said to them, "Why do you have these thoughts in your hearts?"
As for Sahl, it is said to the paralyzed person: Your sins are forgiven. Or it is said to him: Get up, lift your bed, and go?
But you must know that the son of man has the authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic:
I am saying to you: Get up, take your bed, and go to your house!
And the man arose, shook his mat, and went out before the people. And they all marveled, gave glory to God, and said, "We have never seen such a thing as this!" Jesus chooses his time.
And Jesus went back to the side of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd gathered for him, and he began to teach them.
And as he was passing by, he saw a man whose name was Loi, son of Halfi, sitting in the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
And as Jesus was eating in the house of a Levite, he sat down and ate with him and with his disciples; and many people, both men and women, who were taxed, and who were sinners, arose and stood by him.
When the religious scholars of the Pharisees saw that he ate with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples: "Why does he eat with sinners and tax collectors?"
And Jesus, hearing them, said to them: "It is not those who are healthy that need a physician, but rather those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but rather the sinners." The question about fasting.
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to Jesus: "Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while the disciples of yours do not fast?"."
And Jesus answered them: "It is impossible for those who are opposed to the bride to fast, while the bride is with them. For while the bride is with them, they cannot fast."
But there will come a time when the bride will be taken from among them, and on that day they will fast.
Let no one mend an old garment with a new piece of cloth, for if he does this the patch of new cloth will shrivel and the mending will grow worse.
Behind him, no one was making new wine in fresh skins. He pointed this out to his disciples by saying, "No one makes new wine in fresh skins; if they did, the new wine would have spoiled the fresh skins, and the wine would have run off." Then he added, "But no one makes new wine in fresh skins." Jesus was teaching about the Sabbath.
On a Saturday at #2:23, which is the day of rest and worship for Jews.
And Jesus went out to the fields, and his disciples went in among the wheat and gleaned it.
Jesus replied to them: "Woe to you, if you never read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?"
And how could he enter the house of God, in the days of Abiatar, who was the chief of the priests, and ate the bread that was offered to God, which no one else was permitted to eat, except the priests themselves, and did he not even give some of it to the men who were with him?».
And he said to them: "A human being is created on Saturday, not that a human being is created on Saturday."
For the son of man is the Lord even of the Sabbath."
Chapter Three: Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
And Jesus went back into the inner house of prayer; and there was a man, whose hand was paralyzed.
And the Pharisees kept observing Jesus, seeking to see if He would perform a healing on the Sabbath and to find some accusation against Him.
And Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed, "Get up, stand in the middle!"
And he was saying to the Pharisees, "What is the thing that is allowed on the Sabbath, that we do good or do evil, set a man free or kill him?" And they remained silent.
He pounced upon them, seething with anger, and deeply saddened by the hardness of their hearts. He bade the man, "Stretch forth your hand!" And the man stretched forth his hand, and it became whole.
And at that time, the Pharisees came out and began to consult with the Herodians on how to deal with him so that they could kill him. Many people followed Jesus.
Jesus went out with his disciples and sat down by the Sea of Galilee. Many people from Galilee and Judea sat down with them.
From Jerusalem and Edom, and from the other side of the Jordan Valley and its environs, came to Jesus all these people, having heard what was being done.
And he said to his students to prepare a boat for him, so that the people would not be crowded around him, Mark.
Because he healed many of them, to the point where even all the patients began jostling for him to be touched.
And those possessed by madness, when they saw Jesus, fell at his feet, and cried out, saying: "You are the Son of God!".
But Jesus told them and emphasized to them not to say who He is. Jesus chooses the twelve apostles.
And he went up to a mountain and called out to the men whom he had chosen, and they came near him.
And he chose twelve, whom he called apostles, so that they would be with him and he would send them out to tell the good news.
And they will have the authority to drive out the demons.
Here are the English translations: **First Translation:** This is the number twelve, and here are the names: Simon, whom Jesus called Peter,
Jacob, the son of زبدي, and his brother يوحنا, who was called by Jesus بوانرجس, which means "sons of thunder",
And Andrew, Philip, and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas; James, son of Zile, and Daames; and Simon, called the Networking Belonging,
And Judas Iscariot, who is going to betray Jesus. Jesus and Baalzebul
After that, Jesus went to a house, and a group of people, even until he and his disciples could no longer eat, gathered around him again.
And when the family of Jesus heard about it, they came to take him because they had heard: "This man is out of his mind!"
And the learned men of the Law who came from Jerusalem said, "Behold, there is in it Baalzebul; and there come forth forth the demons with the leader of the demons." - Matthew
Jesus called the religious scholars and spoke with them about the law, and he said to them: "How is it that the devil can expel the devil?"
That kingdom will not be able to remain stable.
Or a family gets divided and starts fighting amongst themselves, that family will not be able to remain stable.
