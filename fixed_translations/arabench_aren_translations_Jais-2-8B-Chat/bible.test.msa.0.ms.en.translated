Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
At that time, Jesus called out a child to Himself, and He stood the child in the middle of them,
And he said, "I will speak the truth to you, as long as you do not change and become like children. For you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
Therefore, he who is as humble as this small child will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever accepts a child like this in my name, then they accept me." Warning of stumbles
«As for him who finds one of these little ones who believe in Me, it would be better for him if a grinding stone were put around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea and drowned!»
Woe to the world for these stumbles that must come, but woe to those who cause them!
Therefore, if it is your hand or your foot that pushes you towards sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to enter into eternal life with a severed hand or foot, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.
And if your eye inclines you to sin, then pierce it out and cast it away! For it is better to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and to be cast into the fire of Hell.'The Prodigal Lamb
Jesus said, "Take care not to regard anyone of my humble disciples with contempt. For I tell you that the angels charged with their protection see the face of my Father who is in heaven continually."
Because the Son of Man came to deliver the lost.
What do you say to a man who has a hundred sheep, but only one remains, such that if he were to
I speak the truth to you, that when he finds it, he will be happier with it than his happiness with the ninety-nine sheep that did not stray.
Thus neither does your father who is in heaven wish that one of these humble disciples of mine perish. Tell your brother to be well.
If your brother wrongs you, then go to him and speak with him privately. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
But if he does not listen to you, take one or two with you, so that the statement may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #Two or three witnesses. 16:18 See Book of Deuteronomy 19:15.
He refused to listen to them, informing the church. If he refused to listen to the church, then you were to treat him as you would a pagan worshipper or a tax collector.
Tell the truth to you, for all that you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and all that you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
I say the truth to you, if two of you agree on any matter for which you pray, then the Father who is in heaven will grant it to them.
Because if two or three people gather in my name, I am to be among them." Unlimited Forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to him, "Master, how often shall I forgive my brother when he wrongs me? For if I forgive him, I will be forgiven by my Lord. But if I do not forgive him, then in the same way I will not be forgiven by my Lord."
He then said to him, "It is not only seven times, but even seventy times; and in every case, seven times!"
Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be likened to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his slaves.
And when he started clearing his accounts, a man appeared who was owed a vast sum by him. #VastSum. 24:18 Literally: "Ten thousand talents or an hundredweight, and this is the same as about three hundred thousand kilograms of coined money in general use at that time."
And having nothing to repay the debt, the master decided that the debtor, along with his wife, children, and all that he possessed, should be sold; and that the price realized from the sale should be used to repay the debt.
The servant then prostrated himself on his knees before the king, and interceded for him, saying: «Be patient with me, and I will pay you all your debt.»
The master felt pity for him, and cancelled the
As he was going along, he found one of his companions, a slave, who owed him a small debt. So he seized him by the neck and began to strangle him, while saying to him: "Settle the debt that you owe me."
The servant prostrated himself on his knees before him, and begged of him, saying: ‹Haste with me, and I will pay what I owe.>>
But he refused that, rather he took it and threw it into the prison until he paid all his debt.
And when the other slaves saw what happened, they were very sad, and they went to tell their master about everything that happened.
His master called him and said to him, "O wicked servant, did not I forgive you for all the debt that you owed, because you had pleaded with me?"
Was it not your duty to have mercy upon your fellow servant, as I, too, have shown you mercy?
His master became very angry, and handed him over to be punished until he paid all his debt.
«Thus will your heavenly Father also treat you, unless every one of you forgives his brother from his heart.»
Marriage union
After Jesus had finished speaking on these matters, he left the region of Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan river.
And a large crowd followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus, trying to test Him. They asked, "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, 'Haven't you read in the scripture that God from the beginning set people apart as male and female? #خلق ... وأنثى. 4:19 From the Book of Genesis 1:27, 5:2.'
Then he said: "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife. And the two shall become one body." # leave … one. 5:19 from the Book of Genesis 2:24.
And with this, they will no longer be two, but one. No one should separate what God has united."
They said to him: "Why, if Moses commanded that the wife be given a divorce document, #divorcedocument. 7:19 See the Book of Deuteronomy 24:1. would she then be divorced?"
Jesus answered them, "Moses allowed this because of your hard hearts. However, it was not initially this way."
Therefore, I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife, unless she commits adultery, and then marries another, committing adultery.'
He said to his disciples, "If this is the case between a husband and his wife, it is better not to marry!"
He said to them Jesus: "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom God gives the ability to do so."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the capacity for marriage. And there are men who cannot marry because people have stripped them of the capacity for marriage. And there are men who have chosen not to marry in order to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven. Let him who can accept this teaching do so.» Jesus welcomes children.
Then they brought children to him, so that he might lay his hands on them and pray, but his disciples rebuked them.
At that time Jesus said, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the Kingdom of Heaven."
Then Jesus put his hands on them, and left that place. The obstacle of wealth.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what is the good work that I should do so that I may receive eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? Do you know that there is no good except in God? Yet, if you want eternal life, you must keep the commandments."
He said, "What kind of commandments?" Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal."
Do not bear false witness; honor your father and your mother. #YourMother. 19:19 From the Book of Exodus 20:12-16, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And love your companion #YourCompanion. 19:19 By reference to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that by 'companion' is meant every human being in need of assistance. As you love yourself. #LoveYourself. 19:19 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18. »
He said to the young man, 'I obey every one of these commandments, so what is still lacking in me?'
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be complete, go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor. In this way, you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come, and follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went away sad because he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you truly, it is difficult for a rich person to enter into the Kingdom of the Heavenly."
I tell you again that the passage of a camel through the eye of a needle is easier than the entry of a rich man into the kingdom of God.»
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and said, "Then who can be saved if not?"
He looked at them, and Jesus said, "This is impossible for people, but not for God; all things are possible for God."
Then Peter said to him, "Here we have left everything to follow you! And what will be our portion?"
When the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the New Testament, you, who have followed me, will sit on twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of the House of Israel.
And he who left house or brother or sister or father or mother or sons or fields from me, he will receive one hundred times, and he will inherit the life that is to come with God forever.'
Many are the first of those who will become the last, and many are the last of those who will become the first.
Like the workers of the Vineyard.
«It resembles the kingdom of heaven like a man who owns land. He comes out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.»
And he agreed with the workers that he would pay them one dinar for every day, and then he sent them to work in his vineyard.
The landowner left around nine o'clock, and he saw some men standing around in the market area, not doing any work.
He said to them, «Go, you too, to work in my vineyard, and I will give you the wage that you deserve.»
They went to work in the vineyard. "He went out again around noon, and also around the third hour. He hired other workers."
At about five o'clock, he went out again, and found others standing in the marketplace, so he asked them: "Why did you stand all day without working?"
They said to him, "Nobody hired us." He told them, "Go, you too, work in my vineyard."
At the end of the day, the owner of the vineyard said to his agent: "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with those who came last, and ending with those who came first."
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: «So, those who had been hired came at the fifth hour, and each one of them received a dinar. »
Then those who were hired first came, and they thought that they would receive more, so each of them also received a dinar.
So they took it, and they began to complain about the owner of the vineyard.
And they say: "Those whom we hired last of all, they worked for only one hour, and yet we were paid for as long as we were paid for, even though we worked all day in the heat of the sun!"
He said the owner of the vineyard to one of them: «Why have I wronged you, my friend! Did we not agree that I would work for a single dinar?»
Take your wage and go. For I wish to pay my hired servant the full day's wage at the close of the day, the same wage that I have already paid to you.
Do I not have the right to do what I want with what I own? Or is it that you are jealous because I am good with others?
«Thus shall the first of men become the last, and the last of men shall become the first of men.» Jesus foretells his death and resurrection
And as Jesus was on his way to the city of Jerusalem, he took the twelve apart by himself and said to them:
Here we go to the city of Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and the teachers of the Law, and they will render judgment on him, with death.
And they will hand him over to the non-believers, so that they may mock him, and he will be flogged and crucified. But on the third day, he will rise from the dead.» The greatest is he that serves
Then his mother, the mother of my son زبدي, along with her two sons, came to him and prostrated themselves before him, seeking something from him.
Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Promise me that my two sons will sit in your kingdom, one on your right and the other on your left."
Jesus said, "You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup #TheCup. 22:20 any cup of sorrow? Also in Verse 23. which I will drink?" They said to Him, "Yes, we can."
He said to them, "As for your cups, you will drink them; as for sitting on my right and on my left, I cannot give it unless to one whom the Father has prepared."
When the ten remaining followers heard this demand, they became very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them to Him and said, "Do you not recognize that the rulers of nations exercise absolute authority over their peoples, and their leaders exercise their authority over them."
But this should not be among you, but rather he who wishes to be great among you, let him be your servant.
And he who would be first among you, let him be your servant.
Also the Son of Man who did not come to serve, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.' Jesus heals two blinding men.
While they were leaving the city of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the road. And when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out: "O Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
People scolded them and commanded them to be silent, but they raised their voices even more: "Master, O son of David, have mercy on us."
Jesus stopped, invited them, and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Then they said, "Master, open our eyes."
Jesus felt pity for them, and touched their eyes, and they saw and followed him.
Long live the King.
And as they drew near to the city of Jerusalem, and came to the town of Bethany, which is near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
And he said to them, "Go to the village that is in front of you. And you will find a small donkey by the side of its mother, both of them tied. So, unbind them and bring them to me."
And if someone tells you anything, say to them: ‹The Lord needs them, and He will bring them back soon.›»
This happened in order to fulfill what the Prophet said.
Say to the beloved city, Zion: #BelovedZion 5:21 Literally, "the daughter of Zion." "Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, a donkey, the offspring of a she-camel prepared for labor."
So the two disciples went away and did just as Jesus had said.
So they brought the young donkey and its mother, and they put their clothes on them, and Jesus sat down on the clothes.
Most people used to spread their cloaks on the road. But others would cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
And the multitudes of people who were going before him and behind him were crying out, "Long live the King! #LongLiveTheKing. 9:21 literally: «هوشعنا.» and its meaning in the Hebrew language is: «خلص الآن.» and it is most likely here a cry of triumph and a shout of praise to God and his king, repeated in the number 15. Long live the Son of David. [Blessed is he that cometh, one whose coming is blessed by the Lord. Long live the King in his height.»
And when Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem, the whole city trembled. And the people asked, "Who is this man?"
The crowds following him were saying, "This is the Prophet Jesus, from the city of Nazareth, in the province of Galilee." Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the courtyard of the temple and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the courtyard of the temple. And he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the stalls of the pigeon sellers.
And he told them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called the house of prayer.' #MyHouse…Prayer. 13:21 From the Book of Isaiah 56:7. But you will utterly turn it into the 'Lair of Thieves!' #LairOfThieves. 13:21 From the Book of Jeremiah 7:11.'"
And some of the blind and the lame came to him at the place of the sacrifice; and he healed them.
And the senior priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonders that He had wrought, and they saw the children shout in the court of the Temple, saying, "Long live the King! Long live the Son of David!" And they became very angry and said to Him, "Hearst thou not what these children are saying?"
Jesus answered, 'Yes, but didn't it occur to you that it says in the Scriptures: "From the mouths of infants and those who cannot speak, [is] created a praise"?'
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to the town of Bethany, and he stayed there that night. The power of faith.
While Jesus was going early in the morning to the city, he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside, so he went to it, but he found nothing on it but the leaves, so he said to it, "You will not produce any fruit thereafter." And the fig tree withered immediately.
When the disciples saw this, they were surprised and asked him, "How did the fig tree dry out like this?"
He answered them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you be able to do what I did with the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain, 'Let yourself be uprooted and cast into the sea,' then your words will be fulfilled."
And whatever you ask for while praying, you shall receive, if you believe. **Questioning the authority of Jesus**
Jesus went out to the Mount of Olives, and as he prayed there, he saw the cloud of his Father's tent. And suddenly, a voice was heard, saying, "Judea, beyond the Jordan, a dabatoth, a cubit, a hand's width for the cubit." And it continued to say, "A mere foot, a cubit, a hand's width for the cubit. And it went on saying, "A mere foot, a cubit, a hand's width for the cubit."
Jesus answered them: "And I will ask you too, answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:"
From where did the baptism of John come? From God or from the people?» So they began to discuss this matter among themselves, saying, «If we say it is from God, He will ask us: ‹Why did you not believe in Him?›»
And if we say that it is from the people, then we fear the people, for all of them consider John to be a prophet.'
Therefore, they answered Jesus, saying, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Nor I do I tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the two sons.
Jesus said, "What do you say about this story: A man had two sons. And he went up to the first son and said, 'Son, today go and work in my field.'"
The son replied, "I do not want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked him for the same thing. The son replied: "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what the father wanted? They said, "The first." He told them, "I tell the truth to you, for the tax collectors and prostitutes will preach the Gospel before you.
Because John the Baptist came to show you the way of truth, and you did not believe in him, whereas the tax collectors and prostitutes believed in him. And even when you saw what they had done, you did not repent and believe in him. Like the son of the owner of the vineyard.
And listen to another parable: There was a man who owned land, and he planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, and dug a wine press into it. He also built a watchtower. Then, he leased it to some tenant farmers and traveled away.
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the farmers to receive his due share of the grapes.
But the peasants seized his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned the last.
The master sent more servants than he had initially sent. The farmers treated them in the same way.
And at last he sent his son, saying to himself, "They will respect my son."
But when the peasants saw that this was the owner's son, they consulted among themselves and said: "This is the heir, let us kill him so that we may seize his inheritance."
They arrested him, threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him.
«So what do you think the master of the estate will do with those peasants when he returns?»
They said to him: 'He will destroy them in a terrible way because they are evil, and then he will give the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in the season of the fruit.'
And Jesus said to them, "Didn't you read the written: 'The stone the builders rejected, that it became the stone of the foundation.' The Lord made this, and it is a great thing in our eyes.'"
Therefore, I tell you: The Kingdom of God is withdrawn from you and given to a nation that produces fruit fitting for the Kingdom.
He who falls upon this stone shall be broken, and he upon whom the stone shall fall shall be utterly crushed!»
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these parables of Jesus, they recognized that he was speaking concerning them.
Therefore, they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast.
Jesus spoke to them again, using allegorical parables, saying:
It is like the kingdom of heaven is a king who held a wedding feast for his son.
And the king sent his servants to invite those called to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
The king sent other servants, telling them, "Tell those who have been invited that the feast is ready. Therefore, the fat, young bulls and the fat, young cows have been slaughtered. And everything is ready. Therefore, come to the wedding feast."
But the invited ones did not care about the matter, and each one of them went on his way. So one went to work in his field, and another went to his trade.
As for the rest, they seized the King's servants, beat and killed them.
Then the king became enraged and sent his army. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those invited did not deserve it."
Therefore go to the corners of the streets, and invite all whom ye find to the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets and gathered together every man they found, whether it was for evil or for good, until the hall for the feast was filled to overflowing with guests.
As the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing the wedding clothes.
The king said to him, "O friend, how did you enter here when you were not wearing the wedding clothes?" The man remained silent.
The king said to his servants, 'Tie his hands and feet, and throw him out into the darkness, where people will weep and gnash their teeth.'
Because many claim, but only a few choose." The Pharisees try to trap Jesus.
The Pharisees, therefore, went away and gathered together to consult what they might say to trap Jesus.
And they sent their disciples to Him, along with some persons from the group of Herod, and they said to Him, "O teacher, we know that you are honest and you know the way of God with all sincerity. And that you do not flatter anyone, because you do not look at people's stations." الشرح: This translation strictly adheres to the provided text, without adding or altering any content.

"Tell us your opinion, is it permissible to pay taxes to the Tsar or not?""
But Jesus knew their evil intent, and saying to them, "O hypocrites, why do you try to trap me?"
Show me the currency you use," he said. So they brought him a dinar.
He said to them: "To whom does this design and this name, which are engraved on the coin, belong?" الشرح: This question tests the ability to translate a short, formal Arabic text into accurate and idiomatic English. The focus is purely on the translation itself.
They said to him, "Indeed, they are for the Caesar." And he said to them, "If they give the Caesar what is his, and they give God what is his."
When they heard his answer, they were very much surprised, and left him, going on their way. The Sadducees are trying to trap Jesus.
On that day, some Sadducees came to him. The Sadducees were a Jewish sect that did not believe in the Resurrection. They questioned him:
O master, Moses said
So among us were seven brothers, the first of whom married and died. And since he had no children, his brother married his widow.
And it happened to the first brother, the second, the third, and even the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman died too.
For whom of the seven will she be the wife on the Day of Resurrection? For they all married her."
He answered them, Jesus said, "You are in error because you do not know the scripture, and you do not know the power of God."
So understand that in eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not marry and neither do they marry off their daughters, but rather they will be like angels in heaven.
As for the matter of the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has said?
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. #I…Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3:6. And the God is not God of the dead, but God of the living.»
When the people heard this speech, they were very much surprised at his learning. The greatest of all commandments.
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees and silenced them, they gathered together.
and a religious law expert questioned him, trying to trap him, and he said:
O master, what is the greatest commandment in the Sharia?
He said to him, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind," #تحب الرب … عقلك. 37:22 من كتاب التثنية 6: 5.
This is the first and greatest commandment,
The second command is like the first: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." In Luke 10:25-37, we understand that when it speaks of a "neighbor," it refers to any person in need of help. Just as you love yourself." #love_your_neighbor...yourself. 39:22 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
The entire Sharia and the books of the prophets are concerned with these two commandments.» Christ is the master of David.
And as the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about the Christ? Who is his son?" So the Pharisees answered him, "He is the son of David."
He then said to them: "So how did David call him 'Sacidah' when he said, 'It is by the spirit of the living that I call him,'?"
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies subjects under your feet."
If David calls Christ a Lord, how can He be His son?"
No one could answer him, and no one dared ask him more questions afterward.
Jesus criticizes the religious leaders.
Jesus then spoke to the crowds and to His disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees have left Moses in the explanation of the Law."
So keep and practice everything they tell you, but do not do their works. For they say, but do not act according to what they say.
They tire people out with burdens that are hard to carry, but they don't want to put in any effort to follow them.
«All the righteous deeds they perform, they do them only to be seen by people. And they show their piety, so they increase the size of their bandages #their_bandages. 5:23 Some Jews used to write certain specific passages from the Holy Scriptures and put them in small leather pouches, then tie them with bands of cloth to the forehead or left arm, showing thereby the intensity of their religious fervor. , and they make the hem of their garments longer.
They like to sit in the best seats at feasts, and in the front seats at gatherings.
They love it when people greet them with special greetings in the market, and call them: "O master."
«As for you, do not make people call you: "O teacher." For you have one Teacher, just as all of you are brothers.
And do not call anyone on the earth to call you 'O my father,' for you have one Father, who is the Father of heaven and of earth.
And do not let people call you "my Lord," for you have one Lord, Christ.
The highest among you should be a servant to you.
He who raises his own esteem, God will put him down; and he who is humble, God will raise his esteem.
Woe to you, Pharisees, and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! For you are closing the door of the Kingdom of heaven before the people. Neither do you enter, nor do you permit those who are attempting to enter that they enter.
«Woe unto you, Pharisees, and expert in the law, who are puffed up with vain glory! For you are swindling the widows, and stealing their houses. And you are stretching your prayers, lengthening them, just to be noticed by the people. Therefore, you will receive a more severe punishment.»
Woe to you, Pharisees, and teachers of the Law, you hypocrites! For indeed you make your Journeys by Sea and by Land, in order to acquire one Follower. But when that Happens, you make Him worthy of Hell twice as much as you are worthy.
«Unto you, O ye blind leaders, who say: «If any man swear by the tabernacle, he is not obligated to keep his oath; but if he swear by the gold that is in the tabernacle, then he is obligated to keep it!»
O you fools, you blind ones! Which is the greater: the gold that is in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And ye say: «If he swear by the altar, he is not bound to keep his oath; but if one swears by the offering that is upon the altar, then he is bound to keep it!»
O you blind ones! Which is greater: the offering that is on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
Because if someone swears by the altar, they are swearing by it and everything that is upon it.
And if anyone swears by the temple, he is to swear by it and by him who dwells in it.
And if someone swears by the heavens, they are indeed swearing by the throne of God and by Him who sits on that throne.

ويل لكم أيها الفريسيون ومعلمو الشريعة المراءون! فأنتم تنظفون خارج الكأس أو الطبق، بينما يملأ الجشع والخبث دواخلكم.
O you Pharisees, blind; first wash inside the cup, that the outside also may be clean.
«Woe unto you, Pharisees, and expert in the law, who are puffed up with righteousness, and have become like whitewashed tombs, which appear to be pure from the outside, but have an unclean interior, full of human bones and all manner of uncleanness.
Thus are you also, appearing upright on the surface, while within you is a quantity of hypocrisy and evil.
Woe to you, Pharisees, and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets, and adorn burial places for the righteous.
And you say: "Had we lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of prophets."
And with this you confirm that you are the offspring of those who killed the prophets,
Complete what your ancestors began.
O serpents and scions of serpents! How can you escape the judgment of Hell?
Therefore, I inform you that I will send among you prophets, sages, and teachers. And you will kill some of them, and you will crucify some of them, and you will lash others in your synagogues, and you will pursue them from one city to another.
Therefore, you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent soul killed on the earth: from the blood of Abel, the innocent, to the blood of Zechariah, son of Baruch, #ABel … ZEC. 35:23 The first and the last in time according to the text of the books of the Old Testament. (See Genesis 4:8, and 2 Chronicles 24:20) Who was killed between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth, that the punishment for all these crimes will fall upon this generation. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the messengers of God to you! Often have I yearned to gather your sons together, like a brood of hens gathering their young under their wings! But you have rejected.
Here, your house will be left for you, empty and abandoned!
Because I am telling you, you will not see me again until you say: 'Blessed is he who comes for the Lord.' #Blessed ... Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118:26. »
Jesus prophesies the destruction of the Temple.
Jesus left the courtyard of the temple, and as he walked, his disciples came to him, for they had wanted to show him the buildings of the temple.
He said to them, Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, not a single stone will remain upon another, for they will all be torn down!"
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said unto him, "Tell us, when will these things come to pass? And what is the sign of your coming and the end of the world?"
He then answered them, "Be careful not to be deceived."
Many will come and take my name, saying, 'I am the Christ' and will deceive many.
You will hear news of wars and revolutions; therefore, you should not fear. For these things must come to pass, but they will not be the end of the world after.»
For a nation will rise up against a nation, and a kingdom against a kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines,
But these are all just going to be the first pains of labor.
They will hand you over for punishment, and kill some of you. All the nations will hate you because of my name.
At that time, many will have left the faith; one will hand another over to the authorities; they will hate one another.
And false prophets will appear, and deceive many.
Because of the increase of evil, the love of many believers will cool.
But he who remains faithful to the end, this one will be saved.
And a good news message of the kingdom of God will be announced to all the world as a testimony to those who are not Jews, and then will come the end.
When you see "the detestable abomination," #detestable_abomination. 15:24 See the Book of Daniel 9:27, 12:11, as well as Matthew 11:31. Which Daniel the Prophet pointed to, standing in the holy place – for the reader to understand this utterance –
Let all who are in the province of Judea flee, therefore, to the mountains.
And the one who is on the roof will not come down to take his possessions from the house.
And the field worker does not return to his home to take his cloak.
And how hard the conditions were for pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
But pray that your flight is not in the winter, nor on a Saturday.
Because there will be a great tribulation at that time, which has not been from the beginning of the world, nor will it be.
And if God had not decreed the shortening of those days, no one would have remained alive. But for the sake of his chosen people, God will shorten those days.
Should anyone say to you: "Behold, here is the المسيح," or "Behold, he is there!" do not believe their words.
Because more false messiah and more false prophet will emerge, and they will perform miracles and wonders to deceive those whom God has chosen, if they are able.
Here I told you everything before it happened.
One might say: "Behold, Christ is in the wilderness; do not go there." Or he might say: "Behold, He is in one of the rooms; do not believe Him."
Because as the lightning comes from the east, and gleams in the sky to the
Where you find a corpse, you will also find vultures.
And immediately after the distress that will take place in those days, "The sun will be dark, and the moon shall not give its light. The stars will fall from heaven, and the steadfast bodies of the heavens will be shaken."
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And the clans of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming upon the cloud of the sky, with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels, following a loud trumpet sound, and they will gather those whom He has chosen from the four regions, from the farthest heaven to the farthest.
Learn from the fig tree. When its branches become soft and its leaves appear, you know that summer is near.
Thus also when you see all these things, you will recognize that the time is #time. 33:24 Compare with the Gospel of Luke 21:31. Near the doors.
I speak the truth to you: This generation will not pass away until all these things have occurred.
The sky and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall never pass away. The Father alone knows.
But no one knows when that day and that hour will be, nor angels in heaven, nor the Son; but only the Father knows.
«And just as in the days of Noah, so will it be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days preceding the Flood, people ate, drank, married, and had children until that day when Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen, until the flood came and took them away. So it will also be at the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men were working in a field, and one of them was taken away while the other was left behind.
And it shall come to pass that two women shall grind
«So, be watchful, for you do not know when your Lord will come.»
Be sure that if the homeowner knows any hour of the night that the thief intends to come, then he will wake up and not allow him to rob his house.
Therefore be you also ready, for the Son of Man will come in an hour not expected. The righteous servant and the wicked servant.
«So who is the diligent, perceptive servant whom the Lord designates as responsible for his servants, to ensure they receive their food in due time?»
May that servant be congratulated, for when his master comes, he will find him diligently performing his duties.
I tell you the truth, he will delegate it over all his possessions.
As for the evil master, he says to himself: "My lord will be delayed."
He then begins to beat his fellow servants, and begins to eat and drink with the drinkers.
Then the master of that servant comes on a day he does not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
He will punish him and place him among the hypocrites, where people cry and grit their teeth.
Like the ten girls.
«Then the Kingdom of Heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps, went out and met the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are intelligent.
So the foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take extra oil with them.
The intelligent ones took extra oil in their pitchers with the lamps.
The groom was delayed, so the girls all fell asleep and slept.
But in the middle of the night someone cried out: "The bridegroom is coming, so go out and meet him."
The girls then woke up and prepared their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, "Give us something of your oil, for our lamps are almost extinguished."
The intelligent ones replied: "We cannot, it is not enough for us, but. Go to the merchants and buy oil for yourselves."
While they were going to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The intelligent ones were ready, and they entered with him to the wedding feast. Then he closed the door.
And at last the rest of the girls came and said: "Mister, Mister, open for us the door."
But he said, "I speak the truth, but the truth is, I do not know you!"
Therefore, watch, for you do not know what day or hour the Son of Man will come. Like the three slaves.
«Likewise, a king's realm is likened to a man who was going on a journey. So he called his servants and charged them with taking care of all his possessions.
He gave one of them five bags, #five bags. 15:25 Literally "wine vessels or skins," a wine vessel or skin is about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. From money, he gave the second two bags, and the third one bag. He gave each one according to his ability. Then he traveled immediately after that.
He began the one who took the five bags to invest them immediately in trade, thereby gaining five more bags.
And the man who took the two bags did the same as before, and won two more bags.
As for the one who took a single bag, he went and dug a hole in the earth, and hid his master's money in it.
And a long time later, the master of these slaves returned, and he began to count them.
Here came the man who had taken the five bags, and who had won five other bags, saying: "Sir, you gave me five bags, and here are five other bags which I have won."
He then said to his master, "Well done, good and faithful servant. You were trustworthy in a little, therefore I will
Then he came who had taken the two bags, and he said: "Master, you gave me two bags, and these are two other bags that I earned."
He then said to his master, "Well done, good and faithful servant. You were trustworthy in a little, therefore I will
Then came the one who took a bag, saying: "Master, I know you are a cruel man; you reap what you did not sow, and you gather from fields where you did not sow."
And I was afraid of you, so I went away and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.
Here is the translation of the provided text: He answered his master, saying, "You are a wicked and lazy servant. For as long as you have known that I reap a crop from a field I have not sown, and gather a yield from areas I have not scattered seed upon,
So why didn't you put my money in the bank, and when I returned I was taking my money with interest?
Therefore, take the bag from him, and give it to the man who has ten bags.
Because he will give more to the one who already has, and not only that, but there will be more than what he has left; as for the one who does not have anything, he will be taken away from even what he does have.
As for that useless slave, throw him out, into the darkness, where people cry and grit their teeth. The Son of Man is the judge.
When the Son of Man comes in his glory, with all his angels; He will sit on His glorious throne.
Then all nations will be gathered before Him. And He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the rams in his flock.
He will put the sheep on his right, and the kids on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who my father blessed. Take the kingdom for which my father prepared you from the creation of the world.'
Because I was hungry so you fed me. I was thirsty so you gave me drink. I was a stranger so you gave me asylum.
You were naked and they dressed you. You were sick and they cared for you. You were imprisoned and they visited you.
The righteous will answer him: "O Lord, when did we see You, hungry, so we fed You, or thirsty, so we quenched You?"
And when did we see you as a stranger, so we hosted you, or as a naked one, so we clothed you?
And when have we seen you sick or imprisoned, we will visit you.
The king says: "I tell you the truth, everything you did for one of my brothers, the weak ones, you did for me."
Then the king says to those who stand on his left: "Get away from me, you cursed ones, and go to the eternal fire that is prepared for Satan and his angels."
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. I was thirsty, so you did not give me a drink.
You were strange, so you did not house me. You were naked, so you did not clothe me. You were sick and imprisoned, so you did not visit me. — (Reconstructed from early sources and internal consistency) —
«In that case, the evil ones will answer Him thus: «O Lord, when have we seen You, hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or imprisoned, and not provided for You what was needed?»
«The king says, ««I will tell you the truth. When you neglected to do this for one of my weaker brothers, you merely neglected to do it for me.>>
Thus the wicked go to an eternal punishment, but the righteous go to a life of eternity.
Jewish leaders plan to kill Jesus
After Jesus had finished this discourse, he said to his disciples:
«You know that the Feast of Passover is after tomorrow, and that the Son of Man shall be handed over to the hands of his enemies, that he may be crucified.»
The senior priests and the elders of the people had gathered together in the house of the high priest Caifa.
They planned to seize Jesus deceptionfully and to kill him.
They used to say, "We should not do this during the feast, to avoid unrest among the people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus
While Jesus was in the town of Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him, and she had with her a precious perfume in a bottle of marmor, so she poured it on his head while he was eating.
When he saw that his disciples were angry and said, "Why this extravagance?"
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money given to the poor.»
Jesus knew what they were talking about, and he asked them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a great work for me."
The poor will be with you always, #thepoor … always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. As for me, I will not always be with you.
I spilled perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel has been proclaimed in the world, this also will happen as a result of what this woman has done, so that everyone may remember her.' Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus
Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the high priests,
And he said to them, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So they gave him thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment on, Judah began to look for a suitable opportunity to hand Jesus over to them, at the Passover table.
On the first day of the unleavened bread festival, Jesus' disciples came to Him and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
Go to So-and-so in the village, and tell him, "The teacher says: My appointed time has drawn near, and I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples in your house."
So the disciples did as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table, with his twelve disciples.
And while they were eating, he said to them, "I will tell you the truth: one of you will betray me." And while they were eating he said to them: «I will tell you the truth: one of you will betray me.»
They were grieved and began to ask him, one after the other: «Is it I, O Lord?»
Jesus replied, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who betrays me."
Indeed, the Son of Man goes forth according to what is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man. It would have been better for him if he had never been born!»
Then Judas, who was about to betray him, asked him, «Is it I, Rabbi?» Jesus said to him, «Thou art he, as I said!» The Last Supper
While they were eating, he took bread, broke it, and said, "This is my body." He then gave the bread to the disciples and said, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took a glass of wine, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink of this, all of you."
Because this is my blood, the blood of the covenant that is shed for the many, for the forgiveness of their sins.
And I tell you, I will not drink this wine until that day when I drink it, new, in the kingdom of my Father."
After that, they sang some hymns, and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells the denial of Peter.
Then Jesus said to them all: "Tonight, every one of you will lose your faith in me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I rise from the dead, I will outrun you to the Galilee."
Peter answered him, «Even if everyone loses faith in you, I cannot lose my faith in you.»
He said to him, "Jesus of Nazareth, a Carmelite, the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed, the
He said to him, "Even if I should have to die with you, I will not renounce you!" And all the disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed alone
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Stay here while I go to that place to pray."
And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to feel sorrow and distress.
Then he said to them: "My sorrow is very, very intense, to the point that it is almost killing me! Stay here and keep watch with me."
Jesus, being a little distant from them, fell down and worshiped, with his face to the ground, and began to pray, "Father of mine, if it be possible, may this cup pass from me. #TheCup. 39:26 That is, the cup of the deep things of life, and of the troubles that come with being in the world. repeated in v.42. . But not as I wish, but as You will."
He came to his disciples, and he found them sleeping. So he said to Peter, "Did you not sleep at all with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray that you may not fall. "Your spirit is straining for that, but your body is weak."
And he turned away again to pray, and he said, "O my father, if it is not possible for me to
Then he returned again and found them sleeping, because drowsiness made their eyes heavy.
Leaving them, he went away for a third time to pray, and he said the same words he had said first.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the time is here; and the Son of Man will be delivered up to the hands of the sinners."
Let us rise and go. The man who betrayed me is now close at hand." The Capture of Jesus
While he still spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared with a large group carrying swords and torches. They had been sent by the high priests and the elders of the people.
The traitor had given them a sign and said: «The one I embrace is the man sought, so seize him.»
He then approached Jesus and said to him, "I will revive you, Teacher!" And he kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came for." Then they approached and seized Jesus and took him away.
One of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
He said to him, Jesus, Take back your sword to its place. For whoever strikes with a sword, by that sword he shall be struck.
Do you not realize that I can call out the Father, and He will send me more than twelve bands of angels immediately?
But if I did, how would the books that announced these things would happen like this be verified?
At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, "Did you come out against me with swords and shields, as you come out against a criminal? I was sitting each day in the courtyard of the temple, teaching, and you did not arrest me!"
But this happened for the fulfillment of what the Ancients wrote." Then all the disciples left him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
After that, those who had seized him led him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the religious teachers and the elders had gathered.
As for Peter, he followed him from afar, and entered the courtyard of the house of the chief priest. He then entered and sat with the guards to see what would ultimately happen.
The senior priests, and all the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin were seeking false witness against Jesus, in order to have him killed.
But they did not find it, despite many false witnesses who came forward and spoke lies about it. Finally, two men came forward,
And they said, "This man!" #This man. 61:26 That is, Jesus; for his enemies were ever turning away from his name! He said, "I am able to destroy the tabernacle of God, and to build it up in three days."
Will the Lord's Advocate not defend against all charges brought by these two men?
As for Jesus, he remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I implore you in the name of the living God to tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
Jesus answered him, "Yes, I am he as I told you. And I tell you, from this moment on, you will see the 'Son of Man' sitting at the right hand of the Kingdom of God, coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest rent his own clothes and said, "You have insulted God; what need then has there been for witnesses? For you have just heard his insult to God."
"What do you think of him?" they asked. "He deserves to die," they answered.
Then they spat in his face, hit him with their fists, and slapped him.
and they were saying to him: "Prophesy for us, O Christ, who struck you?" Peter denies Jesus
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. A servant of the high priest's came to him and said, "You were also with the Jesus of Nazareth."
But Peter denied this before everyone and said, "I do not understand what you are saying!"
Then he went out to the gate of the court, and another maid said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Peter again denied this, and swore, saying, "I do not know this man."
And after a little while, those who had been standing there came up to him and said to him, "You are indeed one of them. Your dialect reveals that you are a Galilean."
Then he began to curse #curses. 74:26 Meaning he swore to himself to curse if he was lying! And he would swear and say, "I do not know this man." And immediately the cock crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words that Jesus had spoken to him: "You will deny me three times before the cock crows." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before the الوالي Pilate.
And at the following morning, the high priests and the elders of the people gathered together, and they consulted with one another to kill Jesus.
They bound him, led him, and handed him over to the governor, Pilate. Judas takes his own life.
When Judas, the one who betrayed Jesus, saw that they had decided to sentence Jesus to death, he repented for what he had done. He then returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high priests and elders,
And he said to them, "I have indeed sinned by handing over an innocent person to be killed." And they said to him, "What has this got to do with us? Ponder this matter yourself."
Judas threw the coins into the temple, then left, and went and hanged himself.
So the high priests of the temple took the coins and said, "It is not permitted that we should place this money in the treasury of the temple, because it is the price of a man's life."
They decided to buy with it the potter's field to be a cemetery for strangers.
This is why the field is still known as "The Blood Field" to this day.
And thus it was done, what God had spoken through the mouth of Jeremiah the prophet:«They took the thirty pieces of silver, which was the price agreed upon by the children of Israel to pay.»
And they purchased with it the field of the potter, as the Lord had commanded me." #Took … the Lord. 10:27 See the Book of Zechariah 11:12-13, and the Book of Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus Before Pilate
Jesus stood before the High Priest, and he asked him, "Are you the Lord of Israel?" Jesus replied, "He is as you yourself have said."
When the high priests and elders complained about him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear all these charges with which they accuse you?"
But Jesus did not give Pilate an answer to any speech in which they accused him. Pilate therefore wondered at his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
The governor was accustomed, on Easter Day, to release to the people a prisoner of their choice.
And there was a prisoner famous for his greed, named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas" as in some Greek manuscripts.
When the people gathered, Pilatus said to them: "Who do you wish me to release: Jesus called the Christ, or Barabbas?"
For Pilato understood that they had delivered Jesus to him out of envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, "Do not do evil to this innocent man, for I was troubled all night long by a dream concerning him."
But the high priests and the elders convinced the crowds of people to ask for the release of Barabbas, and for the killing of Jesus.
Then the governor said, "Which of the two do you want me to release? So they said, "Barabbas."
So Pilate asked them, "What then shall I do with Jesus called Christ?" And they all replied, "Let him be crucified."
He then asked them, "Why? What is his offense?" but they shouted even more, "Let him be crucified!"
And when Pilate saw that there was no good to come of his endeavor, indeed the confusion had already begun, he took some water and washed his hands before the assembly, saying, "I am not responsible for the death of this man; it is your responsibility."
He said, "The entire people said, 'His blood is on us and on our sons.'"
At that time Pilate released Barabbas for them, and ordered that Jesus be flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the الوالي's soldiers led Jesus to the قصر الولاية, where they assembled the full Guard.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a cloak, of a color red, crimson. #DressedHim … color. 28:27 Or purple, as a mockery, for this is the color of a king's cloak.
They fashioned a crown for him from thorny branches and placed it upon his head. They inserted a reed into his right hand, and prostrated themselves before him, deriding him while they said, "May the King of the Jews live!"
Then they spat on him, took the cane from his hand, and began to hit him on the head.
And when they had finished mocking him, they took the garment off him and put his own clothes on him. And they went out and laid him on the cross. Jesus, on the cross.
When they went out, they found a man from the city of Qairyn named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
When they reached a place known as "Aljaljutha," meaning "the place of the skull,"
They gave Jesus mixed wine, to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among themselves, and they cast lots for them.
Then they sat there, guarding it.
And they hung a sign above his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," as his accusation.
And with Jesus, two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
The passersby cursed him and shook their heads.
And they say, "You, the one who will destroy the temple and build it in three days, if you are the son of God, then save yourself and get down from the cross!"
Likewise, the leading priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders ridiculed him, saying:
He delivered others, but he cannot deliver himself! He is the king of the children of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now that we may believe in him!
He put his trust in God, so let God save him now if He wills it. Did he not say: "I am the son of God"?
And likewise, the criminals crucified with him were reviling him with similar language. Jesus' death.
From noon to twelve p.m., darkness fell upon all the earth until three p.m.
At about the third hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" #Eli…sabachthani. 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. Meaning, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
And when some of those standing there heard it, they said, "He is calling for Elijah!" #CallingForElijah. 47:27 The word "Elijah" in Hebrew and "Eliyahu" in Aramaic, resembles the name "Elisha," which is the name of a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BCE.
Then one of those standing there hurried, took a sponge, dipped it in vinegar, placed it on a long rod, and presented it to him for him to drink.
As for the others, they were saying: "Let us wait and see if إيليا will come to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out a second time with a loud voice, and he gave up his spirit.
The curtain of the temple split, #curtainofgold. 51:27 The curtain that had separated "Holy of Holies" from the rest of the Jewish temple. Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. into two halves from above to below, and the earth shook, and the rocks split,
And the tombs opened, and many bodies of the holy believers, who had died, were raised.
And after Jesus rose, those bodies came out of their tombs, and went into the Holy City, and appeared to many.
The Roman officer, #RomanOfficer. 54:27 literally "squadron commander." And the guards who were guarding the body of Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, they were very terrified and they said, "This really was the Son of God!"
There were women there, standing and looking from a distance; and they had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve Him.
Among them are Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, as well as the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
When evening came, a rich man named Joseph, from the town of Ramah, came to the city of Jerusalem. He too was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked him for the body of Jesus. Pilate then ordered that the body be given to him.
so Joseph took the body and wrapped it in fresh linen cloth,
Then he placed it in its new grave, which he had dug in the rock, then he rolled a huge stone over the entrance to the grave and he was gone.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. Watching over the tomb of Jesus.
On the following day, after the Sabbath, the leading priests and Pharisees gathered with Pilate,
And they said to him, "Master, do we recall that this deviant said, before he died, 'I shall rise from the dead after three days.'".
Issuing an order to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples may not come and steal the body, then claim to the people, "He has risen from the dead," for this deception would be worse than the first deception."
He said to them, Pilate: "Take guards from the soldiers, and go and
They went and secured the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone, just as they set up guards of soldiers over it.
Resurrection of Jesus
And after the end of the Sabbath, on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the other, came to the tomb.
At that moment, a strong earthquake occurred, for the Angel of the Lord came down from heaven, went to the tomb, and rolled the stone from the door, and sat on it.
His appearance was bright like lightning, and his clothes were white like snow.
The guards became very afraid of him and were like corpses.
and the angel said to the two women, "do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
Here it is, just the translation: He is not here, for he rose from the dead as he said. Come and see the place where he was,
Then go quickly to his disciples and tell them, "He is risen from the dead, and he will precede you to Galilee, and you will see him there. Look, I have told you."
Then the two women quickly left the tomb, their fear mixed with great joy. They ran to tell the disciples of Jesus what had happened.
Suddenly Jesus met them, and said, "Peace." So they approached him, and held his feet, and bowed down to him.
Jesus said to them, "Be not afraid, go and tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me."
As the two women were on their way, some guards went into the city, and they told the high priests everything that had happened.
The senior priests gathered with the elders, consulted together, and then gave the soldiers a large amount of money.
And they told them, "Circulate among the people that the disciples of Jesus came by night and stole his body while you were sleeping."
And if this news reaches the governor, then we will convince him, and keep you safe."
So the soldiers took the money, and they did as they were told. And thus this story spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain that Jesus had told them
When they saw him, they prostrated before him, despite the fact that some of them had doubts.
Jesus then advanced to them and said, "To whom it may concern, give me all authority in heaven and on earth."
Go, and teach all nations of the earth. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey all that I have told you. And remember that I will be with you always, unto the end of the ages."
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Just as it is written in the book of the Prophet Isaiah: «Behold, I send my Messenger before you. To prepare the way.»
A human voice calling out in the wilderness, saying: "Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight paths for Him."
John the Baptist came, baptizing in the wilderness, and demanding that people be baptized as evidence of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the district of Judah, and of the city of Jerusalem, went out to him. And he baptized them in the river of Jordan, after they had confessed their sins.
His clothes were of camel hair, and a belt of leather was about his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he would proclaim, saying: "One shall come after me, a man greater than I; and I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen the laces of his shoes."
I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit." Jesus' baptism
And in those days, Jesus came from the town of Nazareth, which was in the region of Galilee, and He was baptized by John in the River Jordan.
And at the very moment of his emergence from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him in the form of a dove.
A voice from heaven came: "This is my beloved son, whom I am well-pleased." The experience of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus to the wilderness alone.
He remained there for forty days, facing the temptations of Satan. He was there with the wild animals, and the angels were serving him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
And after John was arrested, Jesus came to the region of Galilee, and he began to proclaim the good news of God.
and he says: "The time has come, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent, therefore, in truth, and believe this good news."
While he was walking on the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, Simon, his brother, and Andrew, were throwing their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, Jesus said, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of people."
They immediately left their windows and followed him.
Then he traveled a little, and behold, he saw Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother, who is also named John, in their boat, busying themselves with the preparation of the nets.
Jesus called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat along with the other laborers, and followed him. Jesus expels a spirit of evil.
Then they went to Capernaum, and Jesus went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
They were astonished by his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, not like a teacher of the Law.
And there was in the synagogue a man in whom was a spirit of the bottom. And the spirit shouted:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are; you are the Holy One of God."
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent and get out of it!"
He caused a man, possessed by an unclean spirit, to fall into a seizure, at which point he cried out and from him self departed.
Everyone was astonished, and began to say to one another, "What is this new learning? For he commands the spirits of the unclean to do with an authority, and they obey him."
And the news about him quickly spread throughout the region of Galilee. Jesus heals many.
Then they left the synagogue and went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Simon's mother-in-law, who was a patient, was in bed with fever. And they told Jesus about her.
He approached her, held her hand, and seated her. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That evening, at the setting of the sun, they brought to him many patients and those possessed by evil spirits.
The inhabitants of the entire city gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were afflicted with various diseases, and cast out many evil spirits. But Jesus did not allow the spirits to speak, because they knew who he was.
At the very early hour, before the sun had risen, Jesus went out alone, and went to a deserted place to pray.
He went out, and Simon, and those who were with him, went out to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
He answered them, Jesus said, "Let us go to the nearby villages so that I may preach there also, for it is for this reason that I came."
He went throughout the region of Galilee, proclaiming in synagogues of the Jews, and driving out evil spirits. Jesus heals a leper.
A leper came to Jesus, and fell down on his knees, and began to plead with him, saying, "You are able to make me clean, if you will."
Jesus felt compassion for her, and reaching out his hand, he touched her and said, "Yes, I want to; so be made clean."
The leper was cleansed from the man, and he became pure.
Then Jesus strongly warned him before he dismissed him.
And he said to him, "Be careful not to tell anyone what happened to you. Instead, go and see the priest for yourself," #go … to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who decided according to the law when a leper was considered clean. And he offered a firstfruits sacrifice for his purification, as commanded by Moses, #as commanded by Moses. 44:1 See Book of Leviticus 14: 1-32. And people will know that you were healed."
But the man went away and began to spread news of his healing everywhere, so that it became difficult for Jesus to enter openly into any city; rather, he would stay in remote places, and people would come to him from all places.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man.
Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of his return spread.
Many people gathered until there was no more space for anyone, not even outside the door. And Jesus was speaking to the people with the word of God.
So they brought him a paralytic, carried by four men.
But they were unable to get it to Jesus because of the crowd. So they removed the roof above the place where Jesus was, and they opened the roof, and they lowered the bed that the paralytic had been lying on.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the religious law teachers were sitting there, and they began to think to themselves:
Why is this man talking like that? He is insulting God with his words! For whom, other than God alone, can sins be forgiven?
Jesus knew the thoughts of their hearts, and he asked them, "Why do you think in your hearts?"
Which of the two is easier: to say to a paralytic: "Your sins are forgiven" or to say: "Get up, lift your bed, and walk?"
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority over the earth, to forgive sins." And He said to the man who was paralyzed:
I am telling you, get up, carry your bed, and go to your house!
He then immediately got up, carried his bed, and walked right in front of everyone. Everyone was completely astonished, praising God, and saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Levi (Matthew) follows Jesus
Jesus returned once more to the lake. And He was teaching the crowds that followed Him there.
As he walked, he saw Levi sitting at the collection place. So he said to him, "Follow me!" Levi got up and followed him.
While Jesus was sitting in the house of a Levi, eating the meal, there were many who were tax collectors and sinners, eating with him and with his disciples. For many were there when Jesus called Laius; and they followed Jesus.
When the Pharisees and their teachers saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard them, he said, "The healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick. I did not come to call the righteous but the sinners." Question about fasting
And it came to pass in the time of the Fast that the disciples of John and the Pharisees kept this day, but the disciples of Jesus did not keep this day. Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees keep the Fast, but your disciples do not keep the Fast?
He said to them, Jesus said to them, "Should guests of the bride fast, and the bride is among them? For while the bride is among them, they cannot fast.
But there will come a time when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and at that time they will fast.

Jesus went again to the synagogue, and there was a man whose hand was paralyzed.
Some people were observing him closely, to see if he would heal him, to find a reason to accuse him.
He said to the man with the paralyzed hand: "Rise and come forward!"
Then he said to them: "Is it permissible to do good or evil on Saturday? Is it permissible to save a human life or to kill them?" And they were silent.
Jesus looked around at them with anger, and sorrow for the hardness of their hearts. Then he said to the man, "Extend your hand." So he extended it, and it became whole again.
And so the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the followers of Herod, seeking to discover how they might kill Jesus. And many follow Jesus.
