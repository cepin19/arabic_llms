The greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a boy to him, and He set him in their midst.
And he said, "Truly I say to you, unless you turn back and become like the first ones, you will not enter the Kingdom of the Heavenly."
He who puts himself like this boy is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And before, a single boy like this in my name, he accepted me.
And it is better for him that a stone of the mill roll and drown in the depths of the sea should encumber his neck.
Be careful, world, from stumbles! For stumbles must come, but be careful for that human who by him the stumble comes!
If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life as a lame or a maimed than to face the fire of eternal destruction with two hands or two feet.
And if your eye causes you trouble, then pluck it out and cast it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life as a one-eyed person than to be cast into the hellfire of fire, and you have two eyes. Like the lost sheep.
Look, do not despise anyone among these little ones, for I tell you: their angels in the heavens are continually looking at the face of my Father who is in the heavens.
For the Son of Man has come to deliver what has been lost.
What do you think? If a person has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine sheep by the mountains and go look for the lost sheep?
And if it happens that he finds him, then let me tell you: it makes him happier than the ninety-nine that never went astray.
Thus, it is not the will of your father, who is in the heavens, that one of these young men should perish. But if your brother has sinned against you;
And if your brother wrongs you, go and rebuke him between you and him, alone. If he hears you, you have won your brother.
And if it is not heard, then take also with you one or two, that every word may be confirmed by the mouth of two or three witnesses.
And if he does not hear from them, say to the church. And if he does not hear from the church, let him be to you like the unclean and the tax collector.
By the truth, I say unto you: Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven.
And I also say to you: If two of you agree about some matter, concerning whatever they seek, it shall be theirs by the father's authority who is in the heavens.
Because wherever two or three gathered in my name, there I am among them. Like a servant who does not forgive.
Then Peter approached him and said, "Lord, how often does my brother offend me, and I forgive him? Is it up to seven times?"
He said to him, Jesus, "I do not tell you until seven times, but until seventy times seven times."
Therefore it is like a king's kingdom in heaven, a sovereign who wanted to call to account his servants.
When he began the accounting, one person presented to him, owing ten thousand talents.
And having nothing with which to satisfy his master's order, "Let him, and his wife, and his children, and all that he possesses, be sold, and the debt be paid." **Note:** This translation focuses on conveying the core meaning of the text.

Fakhr al-'Abd, his companion, was on foot. He asked him, saying, "Halt, my master, that I may repay you for all."
He did not answer, but instead went and threw him in prison until he repaid the debt.
When the slaves saw their master, who was sad, they were very sorrowful and came and told their master everything that happened.
He then called his master and said to him, "O ʾabd, ʾalšarīr." (O slave, most evil.) "Eat all that religion which I left for you, because you asked me to."
Was it not your duty also to have mercy upon the servant, your fellow slave, as I have mercy upon you? الشرح: This translation aims for accuracy and a slightly formal tone, reflecting the original Arabic text's rhetorical nature. It directly translates each part of the sentence.
And his master, out of his anger, delivered him into the hands of those who torture, so that all that was owed him might be fulfilled.

Marriage and Divorce
And when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from the Galilee and came to the borders of the Jews, from across the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him; and there he healed them.
The Pharisees came to him to test him, saying to him: "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his woman for every reason?"
He answered and said to them, "Did not it read, 'The one who created at the beginning created them male and female?'"
And he said, Because of this, a man leaves his father and mother and sticks to his wife, and the two become one body.
If they are not yet two but one body, then what God has joined, no man can tear asunder.
They said to him: "Then why did Moses recommend that a divorce book be given, so that a divorce may be initiated?"
He said to them: "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not so."
And I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife except for the cause of adultery, and marries another, commits adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.'
His disciples said to him, "If a man is to associate with a woman in this way, then he should not agree to marriage!"
He said to them: "Not everyone will accept this word, but those to whom it is given,
Because some men are born without the ability to have children, and some have been castrated by others, and still others have castrated themselves for the purpose of the Kingdom of Heaven; as for those who are able to accept it, let them accept it." Jesus blesses the children.
At that time, boys were brought to him so that he might lay his hands upon them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
As for Jesus, he said, "Leave the children alone, come to me; do not prevent them, because for such there is the Kingdom of the heavens."
He placed his hands on them and went from there. The rich young man.
And if someone comes forward and says to him, "O good teacher, righteous; what good shall I do that I might have everlasting life?"
He said to him, "Why do you call me righteous? No one is righteous except God, who is one. But if you want to enter the life, then keep the commandments."
He said to him, "What are the commandments?" Jesus replied, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor thy father and thy mother, and love thy neighbor as thyself.
The young man told him, "All of this I memorized from my youth. What more do I need?" الشرح: This question tests the ability to accurately and concisely translate a given text into English, adhering to the specific output requirements.
He said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. And come, follow me."
When the young man heard the word, he departed sad, for indeed he was of great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is difficult for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of heaven!"
And I also tell you this: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God!».
When his disciples heard about him, they were very astonished, saying: "If, then who can be saved?"
And looking at them, Jesus said, "This, at the hands of men, is not possible, but at the hands of God every شيء is ممكن."
Peter then answered him, saying, "Here we have left all, and have followed you. What then shall we have?"
He said to them, "I tell you the truth, you are the ones who followed me, in the renewal, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious seat, you will also sit on twelve chairs, judging the tribes of Israel, twelve.
He who left his fathers, or his brothers, or his sisters, or his mother, or his wife, or his children, or his fields, for my sake, shall take a hundredfold and inherit everlasting life.
But many are first, others being last, and others first.
Like the doers of noble deeds.
The kingdome of the heaven is like a man, the lord of the house, who went out early in the morning to hire men for his vineyard.
He agreed with the murderers that they would receive a dinar today, and he sent them to his vineyard.
Then he went out towards the third hour and saw others standing in the market, idly waiting.
He said to them, 'Go, you too, to the vineyard. I will give you what is rightfully yours. So they went.'
He also went out around 6:00 and 9:00 and did likewise.
Then around 11 o'clock, he went out and found others standing idly, and he said to them, "Why did you stand here all day, idly doing nothing?"
They said to him, "Because no one hired us." He said to them, "Go you also to the vineyard and take what is yours rightfully."
When it was evening, the owner of the vineyard said to his agent: "Call the workers and give them their wages, starting with the last ones and going to the first ones."
So those who were entrusted with the Hour, at eleven o'clock, came and took a single dinar.
When the first ones came, they thought they would take more. So they also took one dinar, one dinar.
And while they were taking [something/some action], they complained about the master of the house.
saying: those others worked for one hour, and you compared them to us, us who bore the burden of the day and the heat!
He replied and said to one of them, "Friend, I did not wrong you! Did I not agree with you for a dinar?"
Take what is yours and go, for I want to give this last one like you.
Or is it permissible for me to do as I please with what is mine? Or is it your evil eye because I am good?
Thus are the others first, and the first others, for many claim and few are chosen." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples in private on the way, and said to them:
We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will convict him of death.
and they will hand him over to the nations so that they may mock him and flog him and crucify him, and on the third day he will rise.' A request, or is it my son, Zabadi?
Then my mother-in-law, the mother of my sons, Zebedee and James, came forward, along with her two sons. She prostrated herself and pleaded for some item.
He said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that our two sons, one on your right and the other on your left, be in your kingdom." الشرح: The translation directly reflects the meaning of the Arabic text.

Jesus answered and said, "Are you unaware of what you are asking for? Can you drink the cup that I will drink, and can you be baptized with the baptismal water that I will baptize with?" They said to Him, "We can." This is the most accurate and natural-sounding English translation of the provided Arabic text.
Then he said to them, "As for my cup, you shall drink it; and with the dye with which I am dyed, you shall be dyed. But as for seating to the right and to the left, I have no authority to give it, except to those whom I have prepared for my father."
When the ten heard, they were angry because of the two brothers.
Jesus called them and said, "You know that the kings of the earth exercise dominion over them, and the mighty ones exercise authority over them."

And he who wants to be among you first, let him become your servant.
Also, the Son of Man did not come to serve, but to serve. And to give himself as a ransom for many.' Healing of the blind in Jericho.

He scolded them, the assembly, to be quiet. But they screamed even more, saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, O son of David!"
Jesus stood up and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
He said to them, "Master, that we see with our eyes!"
Jesus felt pity for them and touched their eyes; at once their eyes were opened, and they followed him.
Entering Jerusalem
And when they approached Jerusalem and came to the house of Peter, at the place where Jesus was as a stranger, then Jesus sent two disciples.
saying to them: «go to the village that is in front of you, for at the time you will find our she-camel tethered and a young male with it, tether them and bring them to me.
And if someone tells you this, say: "The Lord needs them. And immediately He will send them."
This was all for the purpose of fulfilling what was spoken about in the Prophet, who said:
Say to the daughter of Zion: Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, and the son of a donkey.
So the two disciples went and did what Jesus had told them to do.
And they brought the she-camel and the foal, and they put their clothes upon them, and they sat upon them.
And the larger group spread their clothes out in the road. And others cut branches from trees and spread them out in the road.
And the multitude who went before and the ones who went after, they cried out, saying: "Save us, Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord! Save us in the Highlands!"_.
And when he entered Jerusalem, the entire city trembled, saying, "Who is this?"
The crowd said, "This is Jesus the prophet, who is from Nazareth in the Galilee." The cleansing of the Temple
Jesus entered the sanctuary of God and brought out all those who were selling and buying in the sanctuary. He turned over the tables of the money-changers and the stalls of the sellers of doves.
And He said to them, "It is written: 'My house is a house of worship.' They call it by that name, but you have made it a den of thieves!'".
He and his uncle came to him, and he limped in the temple, and they healed him.
When the heads of the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes saw the wonderful miracles that He had made, and the children were screaming in the temple and saying, "Bless the Son of David!" They became angry.
And they said to him, "Dost thou hear what these say?" And Jesus said to them, "Verily, I am not deaf; have you never read, 'From the mouths of children and infants is given to understand a praising work'?"
Then he left them and went outside the city to Bethany, and he stayed there. The fig tree withers.
And early in the morning, when he was on his way back to the city, he became hungry.
He looked for a fig tree on the road, and came to it, but he found nothing in it except leaves only. So he said to it, "Let there be no fruit from you henceforth for ever!" So the fig tree withered away immediately.
When the disciples saw that, they were surprised, saying: "How did the fig tree dry in that very moment?"
Jesus answered them and said, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you not only won't do the deed of the vine, but even if you said also to this mountain, 'Move, and be thrown into the sea; it will.' "
And every good thing that you ask for, if you do it with faith, you will have it." The question is about the authority of Jesus.
And when he came to his temple, the heads of the priests, and the elders of the land came up to him, as he knew, and said, "By what authority dost thou do this, and to whom hast thou given this authority?"
Jesus answered them and said, "I also ask you one word; if you tell me it, I will tell you also by what authority I do this:"
The baptism of John: From what did it come? From heaven or from the people?». And they pondered to themselves, saying: «If we say: From heaven, He will say to us: Why then did you not believe?».
And if we say 'from the people,' we fear the mob, for John is regarded by all as a prophet.'
They answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them too, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. Like two sons
What do you think? A man had two sons, and he went to the first son and said, "My son, go today and work in my vineyard."
He answered and said, "I do not want." But he finally regretted it and went away.
and he came to the second and he said, "likewise." and he answered and he said, "here I am, master." and he did not go away.
Which of the two shall be the master? They said to Him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "I tell you of the truth: That the extroverted and the prostitute will be before you in entering the Kingdom of God."
Because John came to you in the path of truth, but you did not believe in him. As for the tax collectors and prostitutes, they believed in him. And you, when you saw, did not finally regret to believe in him, like the vintners.
Hear another parable: There was a man of a house who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, dug a press into it, built a tower, and handed it over to vineyard tenants, and he traveled.
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyards, to take the fruit of the vine.
So the noblemen took their slaves, and the slaves were flogged, some were killed, some were stoned to death.
Then he also sent other servants, more than the first ones, and they did to them the same thing.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They fear my son!"
And as for the honorable ones, when they saw the son, they said among themselves, "This is the heir! Let us kill him and take his inheritance!"
So they took him and brought him outside the vineyard and killed him.
When the master of the vine comes, what does he do to those vineyard workers?
They said to him: "These bad people will destroy them completely, and the vineyard will be handed over to other vineyard owners who will give it the fruits at their proper times."
He said to them, "Have you never read in the books that the stone rejected by the builders, has become the head of the corner? From the beginning it was so, and it is very strange in our eyes!"
Therefore, I tell you: The Kingdom of God will be withdrawn from you and given to a nation that produces its fruits.
He who falls upon this stone will be bruised; and he who falls upon it will crush it!».
And when the chief priests, the Pharisees, and the luminaries of the people heard of these parables, they recognized that they were directed at them.
And while they were seeking to seize him, they feared the crowd, for he was regarded by them as a prophet.
Like a wedding of the king's son.
And Jesus made them hear the parables, saying:
It is like the kingdom of heaven is like a human, a king. He made a wedding for his son,
And he sent his servants to invite the guests to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
He also sent other servants, saying, "Tell the invited ones: 'Behold, my repast I have prepared. My oxen and fattened animals I have slaughtered, and all is ready. Come to the wedding!'"
But they neglected it and went on, one to his field, and another to his trade,
And the others seized his slaves, insulted them, killed them.
When the king heard of it, he became enraged, and he sent his soldiers, and he destroyed those murderers, and he burned their city.
Then he said to his servants, "As for the wedding, it is ready; and as for the invited guests, they were not worthy."
Go to the crossroads, and for everyone you find, invite them to the feast.
Those slaves went out onto the roads, and gathered all those they found, wicked and good. So the wedding reception was filled with those seated.
When the king entered to look at the attendants, he saw there a person who was not wearing the wedding clothes.
He then said to him, "O companion, how did you enter here when you had no wedding clothes on?" At this, the man fell silent.
Then the king said to his servants, "Seal his feet and his hands. Take him and cast him into the outer darkness. There his will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
Because many claim and few are elected." Extortion of the Emperor
At that time the Pharisees went and consulted, so that they would catch him in a word.
And they sent unto him their disciples, with the Pharisees: and they said unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art a الصادق, and knowest the way of God truly, and sufferest not of all men, because Thou dost not look upon men's faces.
So tell us: what do you think? Is it permissible that you be given tribute to Caesar or not?».
Jesus, knowing their deceit, said, "Why do you test me, O hypocrites?"
Show me the transaction of the jizya. And they presented to him a dinar.
He said to them: "To whom does this image and writing belong?"
They said to him: "To Caesar." He said to them: "Give, and if Caesar is to be given to Caesar, and what is God's is to God, give."
When they heard, they were amazed, and they left him and went away. The question is about the Resurrection of the Dead.
On that day, Pharisees came to him, who professed, 'There is no resurrection.' And they questioned him.
saying: "O teacher," Musa said, "if someone dies and has no children, his brother shall marry his wife and they shall conceive a child for their brother."
We had seven brothers, and the first one married and died. Not having any offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second and the third to the seven.
And the last one died, the woman too.
On the Day of Resurrection, for which of the seven will be a wife? For she was for all!».
Jesus answered them and said, "You are misled, for you do not know the scriptures, and you do not understand the power of God."
Because in resurrection they are not married neither do they marry, but they are like angels of God in heaven.
As for the Resurrection of the Dead, have you not read what was said to you before by God, the One Who Says:
Am I the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
When the crowds heard him, they were stunned by his teaching. The Great Commandment
As for the Pharisees, when they heard that he was dumb, the Sadducees gathered together,
One of them, who was a mosquito, asked him to try it, saying:
O master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
He said to him, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest of all وصايا.
And the second is like the first: love your neighbor as yourself.
These two verses state that all the Law and the Prophets pertain to the Christ and David.
And while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
saying: "What do you think about the Christ? The Son of whom?» They said to him: "The Son of David."
He said to them: "How then does David call him with the Spirit as Lord? Saying:"
The Lord said to his Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for you."
So if David called him Lord, how would he be his son?».
No one could answer him with a word. From this, today no one dares to ask him at all.
The warning against scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.
saying: "upon the chair of Moses sat the scribes and the Pharisees,"
Everything they told you to keep, keep it and do it. But according to their works, do not do them, for they say but do not do. For they deal with flesh and blood, with the passions of the soul, and with the things that are seen and heard.
They load heavy and difficult loads, and place them on the shoulders of people, and they do not want to move them with their finger,
And all their deeds they do that they might be looked upon by the people: and they exhibit their bands and they magnify the tassels of their garments,
They love the first cushion in the banquets, and the first seats in the assemblies.
And greetings in the markets, and for people to invite them: My Lord, my Lord!
And as for you, do not say, "Lord, Lord," for the teacher is one, Christ. And as for you all, you are brothers.
And do not have for yourselves a father on the earth, for your Father is one, the Almighty, Whose stretching heaven holds the earth in His arms. (The provided translation is based on the common interpretation of Islamic scripture. It focuses on conveying the core message.)

From the fig tree, they learned the proverb: When its branch became tender and it produced its leaves, then you will know that summer is near.
Thus are you also; when did you see all this? Know then that it is near at the doors.
Truly I tell you: This generation will not pass away until all this is.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. The constant readiness.
As for that day and that hour, no one knows them, not the angels of the heavens, except for my father alone.
And as were the days of Noah, so will also
Because, as they were in the days that were before the flood, eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage, even to this day that Noah entered into the ark,
And they did not know until the flood came and took everyone; so it was also with the coming of the Son of Man.
Then two shall be in the field; one shall be taken and the other shall be left.
Two grinders are grinding on the millstone; one is taken and the other is left.
"Stay awake then, for you do not know in what hour your Lord comes."
And know this: if the master of the house knew in what part of the night the thief would come, he would not have stayed awake, nor would he have let his house be broken into.
Therefore be you also prepared, for in an hour ye think not, the Son of Man comes. Like a faithful servant.
He is the faithful servant, the wise, who has been established by his master over his servants, that he may give them food in its due time?
Happy is that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing thus!
Truly I tell you: He will assess it against all his wealth.
But if that disobedient servant, whose heart is filled with evil, says to his master, 'My master's arrival is delayed,' then...
He begins to beat his slaves, his associates, and he eats and drinks with the drinkers.
Lord of that servant shall come on a day he expects not, and at an hour he knows not.
He cuts it up and makes his share with the hypocrites. There, it is for weeping and grinding the teeth.
like the ten virgins
Then the Kingdom of Heaven shall be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were wise, and five were ignorant.
As for the ignorant women, they took their lamps but did not take oil with them.
And as for the wise women, they took oil in their vessels, along with their lamps.
And when the groom was slow, all of them who were sleeping, both slept.
At midnight, there was a shout, "Here is the bridegroom; come out to meet him!"
All those maidens rose up and they repaired their lamps.
The ignorant said to the wise: Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
The wise women answered, "Perhaps it is not enough for us, but, rather, go you to the sellers and buy for yourselves."
As they were going to buy (things), the groom came. Those who were getting ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was closed.
Finally, the remaining maidens came, also saying, "Master, master, open for us!"
He replied and said: "Truly, I say, but: I do not know you."
Stay awake then, for you do not know what day it is, nor what hour the Son of Man will come in. Be like the talents.
«And as though a human traveler had called his slaves and entrusted them with his possessions,
He gave one a five talents, another two, and another one. Each one gave according to his ability, and he traveled at the appointed time.
He who had taken the five talents and invested them, profited, gaining another five talents.
And so, the one who took the two talents, also profited with two more talents.
And as for the one who took the talent, he went and dug in the ground and concealed his master's silver.
And a long time later, the master of those slaves came and held them accountable.
He who had taken the five talents came and presented five more talents, saying, "Master, in the five talents you delivered to me, here are five more talents I have earned beyond them."
He said to his master, "Amazing, O faithful and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy in a small matter, therefore I will appoint you over a great matter. Go and rejoice with your master's delight."
Then came the one who took the two talents and said, "Master, two talents you delivered to me. Behold, two more talents I have won above them."
He said to his master, "A good and faithful servant, in whom I have confidence, I will promote to a more important position." "Go, enter the happiness of your master."
Then, there came also the one who had taken the one talent and said: "Master, you know that I am a harsh man, harvesting where no seed was sown, and gathering in from where no broad tossed seed was thrown."
And I was afraid and went on, hiding and weighing you in the land. Behold, here is what is yours.
He answered his master and said to him, "O servants, you are a wicked, lazy servant. You know that you reap where you do not sow, and gather where you do not sow."
The silver should have been placed with the moneychangers, so that when I came for it, I could take what was rightfully mine along with a stipulated interest.
Take from him the talent, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
Because everyone who has will be given more, and whoever does not have will take away what they have.
And the idle servant, cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall he have weeping and grinding of teeth. The sheep and the lamb.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels and the holy ones with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory.
And all the nations gather before him, and he distinguishes some from others, as the shepherd distinguishes the sheep from the lamb.
The sheep will be on his right, and the kids will be on his left.
Then he says to the king who is to his right: Come, bless my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
Because I was hungry, so you fed me. Because I was thirsty, so you gave me a drink. Because I was a stranger, so you made me feel at home.
Naked, you clothed me. Sick, you visited me. Captive, you came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'O Lord, when did we see You as hungry, and feed You; or as thirsty, and give You to drink?'
And when have we seen you a stranger, so we have provided for you, or naked, so we clothed you?
And when have we seen you sick or imprisoned, so that we might come to you?
The king will reply and say to them: Behold, I say to you: Behold, you have done it to one of my brothers, even to the young men; it is they that I have done to.
Then he also says to those on the left: Go away from me, you accursed ones, into the fire which is prepared for إبليس and his angels,
Because I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me a drink.
You were strange, so you did not house me. Naked, so you did not clothe me. Sick and imprisoned, so you did not visit me.
At that time, they will also answer Him, saying: O Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or imprisoned, and not served Thee?
I will answer them, saying, "Truly I say to you, since you have not done it to one of these 1ninies, it is to me you have not done it."
These go to eternal suffering, while the righteous receive eternal life.
Conspiracy to murder Jesus
And when Jesus had finished these words, he said to his disciples:
You know that in two days' time it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
At that time, the heads of the priests, the scribes, and the elders of the community gathered together in the house of the chief priest, who was named Caiaphas,
They consulted together to seize Jesus by deception and kill him.
But they said, "There is no command in the festival that there should not be confusion among the people." And they poured out the perfume on Jesus.
And as Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him, carrying a bottle of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head while he was reclining.
When his disciples saw that, they became angry, saying, "Why this destruction?"
Because this good could have been sold for much and given to the poor.''
Jesus knew that they had been speaking about his mother, Mary, and about the good work she had done for him.
For the poor are with you always, but as for me, I am not always with you.
For by pouring this perfume upon my body, she did so for the purpose of my being properly buried.
Truly I tell you: wherever this Gospel is preached throughout the world, it also proclaims what these have done, as a memorial of them. The treachery of Judas.
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the high priest's
And he said, "What do you want to give me while I hand it over to you?" So they gave him thirty of the silver.
From that time he was seeking an opportunity to hand him over. The Easter meal with the disciples.
On the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples presented themselves to Jesus, saying, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
Go to the city, to So-and-so, and tell him: The teacher says that my time is near. With you I will make the Passover with my disciples.
So the disciples did as Jesus had told them and prepared for the Passover.
And when the evening came, he leaned against the twelve.
And as they ate, he said, "I tell you truly, one of you will betray me."
They were overcome with grief, and each one of them began to ask him, "Am I him, O Lord?"
He answered and said: "The one who dips his hand with me into the same bowl is the one who delivers me to them!"
The son of man is going, as it is written about him; but woe to that man who in him the son of man is handed over. It is better for that man that he was not born!».
He responds to the one who handed him over, and asks, "Is it I, Lord?" He is told, "You did say so." The Last Supper
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed, broke it, and gave it to the disciples. And he said, "Take all, and eat. This is my body."
and he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
Because this is my blood, which is for the new covenant, which is being shed for the sake of many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you: from now on, I will not drink of this grape juice. This goes on to that day when I drink it with you, new in the kingdom of my Father.'
Then they swam and came out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells that Peter will deny Him.
Then Jesus said to them all: "All of you doubt and believe in this one. This night, for it is written: I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered every which way."
But after I have gone, I will outpace you to the Galilee.
Peter answered him and said, "Even if everyone doubts you, I will never doubt you."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, within this night before the cock crows, will you deny me three times?" (The New American Standard Bible, Emphasis added)
He said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not abandon you!" Thus also did all the disciples. In Gethsemane

Then he came and found them also sleeping, as their eyes were heavy.
He left them and continued, praying a third time, saying that very same words.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Sleep now and rest! Behold, the hour is almost at hand, and the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of the sinners."
Let us go! Behold, he who will betray me is near!». The Capture of Jesus
And as he spoke, behold, one of the twelve came, with a large force, carrying swords and staves, which they carried from the authorities of the priests, and the elders of the people.
And he who delivered him up afterward, when he had given them the sign, said: "He whom I receive into my house, he it is. Seize him."
At that time, Jesus approached him and said, "Peace be upon you, my lord!" Then he kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "My friend, why did you come?" Then they, being in
And if one of the ones with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant, the chief priest's servant, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Sheathe your sword in its place. For everyone who takes a sword to fight with it, perishes!
Do you think I cannot now ask my father, and he will give me more than twelve legions of angels?
So how do books get completed: that it should be thus?».
At that time Jesus said to the crowds: "As for him, it is as though one who is a thief has come out among you with swords and sticks to seize me! Every day I was sitting with you, teaching in the Temple, and you did not seize me."
And all this was for the completion of the books of the prophets. Then the disciples left him all, and fled. Before the synagogue
And those who had seized Jesus went up with him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered.
As for Peter, he followed him from afar to the house of the chief priest, and went inside and sat among the servants to see the end.
And the leaders of the priests, and the elders, and the whole assembly, were seeking false witness against Jesus, in order that He might be killed.
They found none. And although many false witnesses came, they found none. But finally, two false witnesses advanced.
And they said, "This one said, 'I can destroy God's structure, and in three days I will rebuild it.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to him, "Will you have nothing to say? What testimony do these two have against you?"
Jesus, however, remained silent. The high priest then answered and said to him, "I adjure you by the God of Israel, who dwells in Jerusalem, that you tell us: Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
He said to him, "You have spoken, and I have spoken to you: The good news of the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, from the beginning of all ages, to the end of all ages; proclaimed to every nation, in every kind of people."
The high priest then tore his robes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What more need we of witnesses? Behold, you have heard his blasphemy!"
What do you see?" They replied, saying, "It is a matter deserving of death."
At that time, they spat in his face and punched him, while others slapped him.
saying: "foretell us, O Christ, who struck you?"; Peter's denial
As for Peter, he was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a maid came to him and said, "And you were with the Jesus of Galilee!"
He denied in front of everyone, saying, "I do not know what you are saying!"
Then as he went out to the colonnade, another woman saw him, and said to the ones there, "And this one was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
He also denied with an oath, "I do not know the man!"
And after a little while, the Watchers came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also among us, for your language betrays you!"
Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the man!" And at that moment he cried, "The cock is crowing!"
Peter remembered the words of Jesus, who said to him, "Before you cry out, you will deny me three times." He went out to the outside and cried with a bitter cry.
Judas hangs himself.
And when it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered together to consult concerning Jesus, that they might put him to death.
They bound him, went with him, and handed him over to Pilatus, the syngonous prefect.
Then, when Judas, the one who betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high priests and the elders.
saying: "I was wrong to hand over innocent blood." They replied: "What concern is there for us? You are in a better position to judge!"
He threw the silver into the temple and left, then he went and strangled himself.
Then the heads of the priests took the silver and said, "It is not right that we should cast it into the treasury, for it is the price of blood."
They consulted and bought with it a pottery field, a cemetery for strangers.
That is why this field is called "The Blood Field" to this day.
Then it was fulfilled, as written in Jeremiah the Prophet, who said: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the more expensively weighed prize which they weighed from the children of Israel."
And they gave it unto him from the field of the potter, as the Lord commanded me. Before Pilate.
Jesus stood before the ruler. The ruler asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You say."
And while the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were complaining against him, he gave no answer.
He then said to Pontius, 'Do you not hear how many testify against you?'
The governor was very much surprised.
The governor was accustomed on Eid day to release for the gathering one captive, whom they desired.
They had at that time a famous prisoner called Barabbas.
As they were gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas or Jesus, whom they call the Christ?"
Because he knew they had handed him over out of envy.
And as he was sitting on the throne of authority, his wife sent a message to him, saying, "Beware that wretched bar, for I suffered a great deal today in a dream for his sake."
But the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes, they stirred up the crowd, and they asked for Barabbas to be given, and they asked that Jesus might be put to death.
The governor answered and said to them: "Of the two, which one do you want me to release?" They said, "Parabbas!"
What shall I do with Jesus, he whom I called Christ? All of them said to him, Let him be crucified!
The governor said, "And what evil has he done?" So they increased their shouts, saying, "He should be crucified!"
When Pilate saw that it was not to be done, but rather that it would cause uproar, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood! Look, I am innocent!"
He answered all the people, and they said, "His blood is on us and on our sons."
At that time Barabbas was released for them, but as for Jesus, he was flogged and delivered up to be crucified. The soldiers mocked.
So the army of the الوالي Jesus took to the residence of the الوالي (Governor) and gathered upon him all of the battalion,
They clothed him and put upon him a robe of deep crimson color.
They wove a crown of thorns and placed it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. They would prostrate themselves before him and ridicule him, saying to him, "Peace, King of the Jews!"
And they spat on him, and they took the cane and they struck him on the head.
And after they ridiculed him, they took away his robe and dressed him in his own clothes, and then they took him to be crucified. The Crucifixion.
And as they went out, they found a Cypriot man named Simon, and they made him carry his cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which is also known as "The Place of the Skull"
They gave him vinegar mixed with bitterness to drink. And when he tasted it, he did not want to drink.
And when they crucified him, they divided his clothes by lot, that what was spoken about the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "Let them divide my clothes among themselves, and let them cast lots for my clothes."
Then they sat down, guarding him there.
and they placed above his head a written inscription: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Then he crucified with him two thieves, one on the right and one on the left.
Those passing by would paddle on it as they shook their heads.
Saying: «O you who have undone God's structure and its builder in three days, save yourself! If you are the son of God, then come down from the cross!».
And so too are the chief priests, and they are mocking with the scribes and the elders, and they said:
«He delivered others, but his own self he could not deliver! If he be the King of Israel, let him come down this very hour from the cross, that we may believe in him!»
He relied on God, so let Him save Him now if He wills! Because He said: 'I am the son of God!'.
And thus, the two thieves who were crucified with
And from the sixth hour there was darkness on all the earth until the ninth hour.
At about nine o'clock, Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, where didst thou leave me?" That is, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
Some of those standing there, when they heard, said, "He is calling for Elijah."
And for the time being, one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed. He then watered it.
As for the others, they said, "Leave. Let's see if Eli comes to deliver it!"
Jesus also cried out with a great voice, and yielded up the Spirit.
If a divine curtain, the heavens, were to be rent apart into two parts, from above to below. And the earth would tremble, and the rocks would crack.
And the tombs were opened, and many of the bodies of the saints who were lying down rose up.
They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the Holy City, and were seen by many.
And as for the leader of the hundred, and those who were with him, they were guards of Jesus. And when they saw the earthquake and that which had happened, they were very afraid and said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women looking from a distance, who had followed Jesus from the Galilee, serving Him.
And among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and John, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial.
And when the evening came, there came an rich man, named Joseph, from Ramla, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
This is an advancement to Pilatus and a request for the body of Jesus. Then Pilatus commanded that the body be given. This is an advancement to Pilatus and a request for the body of Jesus. Then Pilatus commanded that the body be given.
Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean linen,
And he placed it in its new grave, which it had been carving into the rock, then rolling a great stone over the door of the grave and departing.
Mary Magdalene, Mary, and another Mary were sitting facing the tomb. The guards were by the tomb.
And on the morrow, which was the day following the preparations, the heads of the priests, and the Pharisees, gathered together before Pilate.
saying: "O master, it has occurred to us to recall that it was this misleading person, while he was alive, who said: 'After three days I shall wake up.'"
By ordering that the tomb be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him, proclaiming to the people, "He is risen from the dead," thus falling into the final and most dangerous error, more so than the first!».
He said to them, Pilate: "You have guards. Go
They went and secured the tomb with guards and sealed the stone.
The Day of Resurrection
and after the Sabbath, at the dawning of the first week, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other came to see the tomb.
If a great earthquake occurred, for the Angel of the Lord came down from heaven, came near, and rolled the stone from the door, and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white like snow.
From his fear, the guards trembled and became like corpses.
The angel answered and said to the two women, "Do not be afraid, for you are safe; for I know that you are looking for Jesus, the Man crucified."
He is not here, because he rose as he said he would! Come, look, see the place where the Lord was lying down.
And go quickly, tell his disciples: "He is risen from the dead. He is ahead of you all the way to Jerusalem. There you will see him. I have told you both."
They quickly left the grave, filled with fear and immense joy, running to tell his disciples.
As they were setting out to tell his disciples, Jesus met them and said, "Peace be to you." They then proceeded and held his feet, prostrating themselves before him.
He said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee; there they will see me."
As they went along, behold, a company of guards came to the city and informed the chief priests of everything that had taken place.
They gathered with the elders, consulted, and gave the soldiers a large amount of silver.
saying: "say that his disciples came at night and stole him while we were asleep."
And if he hears this when the governor, we will appeal to him, and make you feel secure."
They took the silver and acted according to their instructions. This saying spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to the disciples.
As for the eleven disciples, they went forth to the Galilee, to the mountain, where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves before him, but some of them doubted.
Jesus therefore came forward and, speaking to them, said, "To whom the dispossession of the earth was entrusted, from the days of old, has delivered up the dominion of the peoples, the dominion of the kingdoms, and the dominion of all nations whatsoever."
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to keep all that I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you for all the days to the close of time.' Amen.
John the Baptist paves the way.
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the Prophets: "I have sent before you my malak, whom will make your way before you."
A voice crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His سبلs."
John baptized in the wilderness, proclaiming with the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the people of the district of Judah went out to him, and the people of Jerusalem; and they all entered into his baptism by the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
John wore the fleece of a camel, a belt of leather around his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying: "He comes after me who is stronger than I; who I am not fit to bend down and loosen the straps of his shoes."
I have baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit." Jesus' baptism and his experience
And in those days came Jesus from Nazareth in the province of Galilee, and he was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as time, which was rising from the water, looked up, he saw the heavens split open, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him.
And a voice from the heavens said, "You are my most b
And for the time he brought it forth, the Spirit to the wilderness,
He was in the wilderness for forty days, trying from the devil. And he was with the beasts. And the angels came to serve him. The Calling of the First Disciples
After John's conversion, Jesus came to Galilee to preach the good news of the Kingdom of God.
and he says: "The time of fulfillment has come, and the kingdom of God has drawn near; therefore, repent and believe in the Gospel."
And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, his brother, throwing a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.
He said to them, Jesus said to him: "Come with me, and I will make you become fishers of men."
They left their windows for the time being and followed him.
Then he went a little further and saw Jacob son of Zebedee and John, his brother, and they were in the boat mending the nets.
Let them be for a time. So they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the passengers, and they went after him. Cast out the unclean spirit.
Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately the assembly was gathered on the Sabbath, and he began to teach.
They were astonished by his instruction because he taught them as one who had authority, not like the scribes.
And there was in their synagogue a man possessed by an unclean spirit, and he cried out
Ah! What business is it of yours, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us! I know who you are: Holy God!
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Shut up! And get out of him!"
The spirit of evil struck him down and he cried out with a great voice, and there emerged from him.
They were all astonished, so much so that some of them questioned each other, saying: "What is this? What is this new method of instruction? For it is by the authority of one who commands, even the spirits, that are unclean, and they obey him!"
So his news went out quickly throughout all the regions surrounding the Galilee. The healing of Peter's mother-in-law and other
And when they had come out of the synagogue, they went up to the room (or house) of Simon, whose family name was Andrew, with James, the son of John.
And the women of Simon's protection were lying feverish; immediately they told him about them.
She advanced and stood her up, holding her hand; but she let her go, the fever leaving her immediately, and she began to serve them.
And when the evening came, and the sun set, they brought to him all the sick and the crazy.

He came to the leper and begged of him, prostrating himself and saying, "If you wish, you can cleanse me."

For as he spoke, the leper departed from him and was cleansed.
Seize him and send him to the time.
And he said to him, "Look, do not tell anyone anything. Rather, go and see the priest and present for your purification what Moses commanded, as a witness to them."
As for him, he went out and began to call out frequently and publicize the news, to the extent that he could no longer enter a city visibly, but rather he was outside in empty places, and they would come to him from all directions.
Healing a paralytic.
Then he entered Capernaum also, after some days; and he heard that he was in a house.
And for that time many gathered until there was not enough, nor what was around the gate. And he addressed them with a word.
