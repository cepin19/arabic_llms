If you don't want, I want.
Oh, my lord, what should I say?
Don't give me an opportunity, opportunity, Ya'itina to weaken our hand, don't allow it.
Then I'm not a kid about a topic, I have the right to take and you don't even have the right to take after me.
Sultan and whoever harms your parents should not bring problems to us.
I shouldn't. Forgive me God.
Honestly, is there a brother advising his brother about what happened and telling him?
You're awake.
I found a plate in front of you with bread and meat.
Chinese is neither a leader nor a provider, nor does it have a boundary.
Tell the truth to yourself.
This Chinese person shouldn't come in front of us again.
I won't be able to, Saleh.
Don't miss the opportunity on us.
Don't even try, it's impossible, impossible. It's not me who does this.
Problem, I'm scared.
I fear the darkness.
This is a government project where everyone takes and spits it back out.
This is a rule.
Now people who have nothing to do with the projects are taking
He is the head of a large project committee.
What do we hear? What does he have, the thread and the weaver?
The Global Beaches Project for the 21st Century (Phase 1 Infrastructure)
The bull was covered in mud.
This is the one with the filter.
If he took it.
What are you doing here?
You have the right to take from their project
When his car was broken down
Whoever was reached by the project website wasn't me.
Bye if that's your right
Whoever gives you the right to oil will make your car four and five times.
Khalah Ali
I don't know what you're talking about and messing with your head.
Reach out and sneeze.
Juff Khamees Rail Khaltik
Now, according to you, they say you're a millionaire.
One-third of the plaintiff's right.
And a third of it is commission.
Whoever causes trouble in the neighborhood
She's telling you to throw a state party.
And we are buying a white feather
What's up?
We cleaned the classroom.
There's no point, Auntie.
Oh God, let God calm him down, God willing.
And he eats with his family.
Last night, all night long, I was trying to talk to him.
This is an opportunity.
Because goodness prevails.
And goodness will be, God willing.
This is a well-known thing.
I need the issue to be between us.
What are you looking for?
After, do you advise?
Just the quarter
A problem that can be stopped like a bone in the throat.
The Rial began Eileen.
He's sitting today.
Morning, two hours
And he began to believe.
We had a listening session with him a while ago.
We need to work on it, you and I.
What I want to cut off our livelihood
I only began listening to him from the age of twelve at his head.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman
I don't know.
Based on the fact that today is my first day of work
Take it easy on me.
How is that not possible?
I'm sure you're asking if I'm sure about taking it, meaning...
Now I'm just asking you
You're awake and walking on the road.
I eat, or I don't eat.
I am a foodie.
You don't have to.
Chinese Oudara
We are just on the first item of the agreement.
If there's something wrong with you.
If you are afraid
I want to know him.
You and I from the project
May God guide you, Saleh.
You can be the first to chair a committee in a government project.
And this is simple, and I'm telling you.
Our share is being put.
Anyone who falls within the project budget
Hey, how, hey.
No one feels the situation.
We put in the eyebrow for the amount.
This amount has been drained.
By the two managers of the project
It can't happen.
No no no, Saleh
You were known before.
But apparently, there's a little bit of fear inside you.
This is his right, of course.
To begin and to end.
Everything is in our hands.
What did you say about that girl being attractive?
How are you? Praise be to God. How are you?
The new Renegade that the guy you met believed in.
He says
The car belongs to Rafah, it's okay, really good.
In a special place
Only one person is still going.
What do I say to you after someone told me or heard from someone?
Anyone who bought the land and registered it in their name.
He told me, "Please."
Now he wants the money in his hands.
It attracts now, indeed.
We are from here.
So, basically.
What is the rush?
It will come out from the eastern door.
I want a dress to eat a mouthful.
Your head doesn't shake.
And if I tell you
You come, sit down, and have a good mood.
I spent the whole night with him.
Let them do whatever they want, even if it’s harmful and they deserve it.
Let him agree.
And this is supposed to
Inshallah, you won't take it more than once and that's it.
This project, the Global Beaches of the 21st Century
[The infrastructure]
He came back to start the second phase.
You guys keep going with him.
May Allah reward you with the best of what is due to you.
Just the one you chose, yes if they agree
You're all in it for yourselves.
It's okay.
But hopefully, I convinced him.
We want to attribute it.
They are all in agreement regarding
He even said something after I didn't agree.
It seems that Bebin is asking his group to attend the budget meeting for the project.
May God grant them success, and we must follow up on it.
They've confirmed it.
Please provide me with the text you want me to translate. I need the original text in Arabic to be able to translate it into English.
Take care.
Who is this guy? Do you know him?
This is happening, the wife's brother is coming over to my place tonight.
This means
You have the doors and windows and everything related to finishes.
Sweet, sweet
Just enough is enough to finish it.
You should have defended yourself.
We're taking something.
Let's think about this for a week.
We are determining the amount we are taking.
Waraana nas tenṭur wa tbi
Abdulaziz Adil said.
He demands one million for his rights.
This week, he should have his own car.
And he specifies the amount he wants.
They decided, they thought, and they defined.
How are you?
How are you?
You shouldn't concern yourself with them.
She's a companion in what, what is she healing this with?
She's asking me, God is with her, she's with us
What are you from Egypt doing in this project you?
This is a commercial project.
Your brother's name is Sultan.
This is Adryol's neighbor's house.
The hours we were driving ruined the car.
Register yourself.
Abdullah's document
Bye in three others after
What are you doing with him? I wanted to get rid of him.
I'm just saying, Mama, let's look at our budget and finish it.
No, this is a fixed amount.
And I put it for him
Poorly, he is burdened with a dependent.
He has a Zaydi, let him have twenty-five quarters of Amīr.
And four-tenths illiterate.
Everyone is stuck to the sticky stuff.
How many are you going to distribute them to?
Came back
My dear mother is remembered with goodness.
Yes, go ahead.
Oh my god, but this is the last one, bro.
No, my brother, you want to go to Thailand to get treated.
May you be healed moment by moment.
What's wrong with you? You're dragging her like this.
Remaining from the first stage (the infrastructure)

Zayd upon them three thousand.
Buy me watches from Thailand that are completely sparkling, like they're full of light.
I recorded it
Which imam?
I didn't register it, I just wanted to make sure with you about the name.
My love, I'm telling you mom.
The Chinese are increasing.
I just need the budget to be determined, it can't just be open like that.
Tomorrow I'm holding a meeting and everyone will say the amount they have in mind.
Take care of yourself.
A million is enough.
Very dear to me
Guys, guys, hold on, let me explain, give us a chance.
The committee is currently reviewing the project budget, which is now finalized and funds are allocated.
I don't understand. Could you please clarify?
We told you there was a quiet conspiracy going on in the Minister's courtyard.
Oh, you supporters, don't expose us.
Is anyone here now and what’s up? You guys are all here.
I'm telling you, the electricity went out and it's sparking, and there's a short circuit in it.
You're making a mess for us in front of the ministry square.
Ya Allah, give Ya Allah, give
Did you hear that?
Seriously, you were at their place how much did I give you for the budget?
Without my brother
With the project, all of us, meaning all of us, fifty million.
This is the first stage, just 50 million.
Please add the amount.
Ha Saleh
Hey, owner of the Al-Naseefah, Salem
In general, may you be blessed with good health.
Okay, let's translate this. Let's go ahead and get to work, everyone. The beneficiaries are all waiting for us, you know.
No problem, but the most important thing is that we don't want debates based on the budget and that's it.
And then we’ll begin implementing the project.
He serves a very large segment of the community.
Please save my soul, the Global Beaches Project for the Third Millennium
This is Stage One, God bless you.
[The infrastructure]
This project is for future generations.
Of course, here’s the translation: Naturally, with this program, we congratulate you and also bless you with the opening of the project, which I believe will be tomorrow, God willing.
And the work on it took about five and a half years.
One and a half
Once again, of course, under the name of the Future Procurement Program
This project
For the next generation
And may Allah grant us continued blessings of oil.

Welcome.
I'm dying of excitement here when will you come to pick me up?
Why do you want to leave me?
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe, Your greatness and Your deafness, You.
We sat and devoured the sun, dying of the heat.
She is like the people.
But I don't see anything.
Majo jaddami ila bahr
Why are you crying?
Aiman told me that her sister Mineh is well.
He was talking about something that happened at my father’s place in the countryside.
He said, "It's fair, look at her, and find out who spread rumors about her," and she said, "False news."
This is a mistake. These are the lands.
But when someone sees a summer house in the countryside, they say it's my father's.
Then what are you doing with these topics?
Do you have siblings?
They admire it, praise it, and invest in real estate, businesses, and everything else.
It's a difficult
Oh, Iman!
And then my sister
How do you not know?
They just give it to them.
Huzaylin, awwanuj.
And there’s nothing better than honesty.
Money is
We should go and support her and take her to the hospital.
She has been in court with her brothers for a while now.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No return
Akhwan Am Salmin harameen
He came back to me yesterday and told me
My son, build me a mosque before I die.
Do you know?
I'm not saying that your brothers are like this, God forbid.
Now my father is not dead, in the year six
What are you asking now?
And he saw the cottage.
What's up?
Once every three months, her Jake goes away.
Falcon, let's find out what's going on.
It's up to Kayla
We changed and, God willing, their sisters are not finding reals.
I have the solution.
From where
And her money is not like that.
Munira Shagayeva
May Allah preserve your stomach.
It became fifty thousand.
Because I’ve tried and asked about my father who is in the bar.
I'm sure my right is because of this.

And their children in the best schools

I'm not going to be silent about my rights.
I'm taking my share.

Compassion has died in the hearts of people.
Don't you say that your brothers are coming out better than mine.
I’m hungry.
Twelve years
I am defending you in these courts.
And in the end
I haven't taken anything, neither right nor wrong.
Seriously, why do they do this?
That’s why I’m telling you, Mom, silence them.
Take them by the line.
وبيلتهونج تلته
So, why do the courts take so many years?
We are all 410 thousand.
If we don't reach millions like other countries
"By God, my love, I didn't even think they would issue a verdict."
Joffi, anti, akhwani.
I swear, Mom, I don't want anything.
Mom, what should I say?
I'm not saying anything, God and He alone are avenged against the oppressor.
Alhamdulillah wa laikumul walā.
Do you have a court appointment scheduled from last week?
Assalamu alaykum ya bima after
He says the judge wants me to write his biography.
This is from my memory to my memory, baby.
You are investing millions and you're just sitting there.
And betting like you told me to tell Adabgin to hurt you and April.
I don't take the right.
Because of that, I'm saying if I were...
Shut up about what he gives me.
The time
My father is halal with us.
Questions are coming to you
Ugh, from there, you know?
Just a few questions, you know, about her share and stuff like that.
I just want to meet and then leave.
If I don't guide him
Snap and massage him

I expect us to have resignation papers.
Fifty-two and really messed up her husband works.
Your head is banging against the ceiling.
What made her speak now?
But greed
And no heaven for me.
My father inherited it to me and he tells me whether to show it or not, or how you should do it.
I or he isn't determined.
This is God's command.
Why are they torturing my father in his grave?
My brothers were expecting something like this.
This money and what are you doing?
She has been working for forty-three years.
I don't know how to act, Nasser.
Real estate and buildings and properties are easy to learn about them
How much do they earn?
Even the company
You have the right to leave and get to know everything.
I won't give them.
How do you come back and leave them?
It depends on your situation.
And it's not up to you, I have the right to see everything.

At your service, your health.
You guys are in front of me.
Excuse me, please, let me.
Don't let him catch us doing anything.
Certainly now if I'm going to complain
He said you're keeping it.
It means letting it be done however it’s done.
In his hand were official papers
Officially, we cannot prevent it.
Who has the right to see everything, all the secrets?
If the budget and accounts are depleted
We give her 40,000 every three months.
If the budget is tight and the account is balanced.
I should twelve in eight.
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
Do you know what comes out?
This is what he asked us to do in Abha.
This depends if the land and projects are known.
And how are we?
We're scared of what we don't understand.
I want welcome, I don't want this existing one.
He's going to deal with it with her.
They give their sisters small amounts to live on.

Her husband spends money on her.

At your service.

When I learned of her true inheritance
Ignore the villas and houses about which you have no knowledge.
They came out seven.

Wow, what a sight!
The poor girl was shocked.
I'm sorry,
Leave them to themselves.
And may your parents forgive you, brother, if I don't go to the court session.

Seriously?
Fuck man
It can affect them.
Inshallah, he/she/it will be able to.
Oh oh oh
I do not resort to courts.
The courts only deal with memorandums.
Turkeys and their butchers are on the backs of incompetents.
The years have passed.
The passage of time
And you don't take from them not a single rial.
May God have mercy on her, Am Salmen.
She told me one day before she died.
She told me, "Are you going to court?"
He tells me about our courts.
She died and didn't take a single thing from her inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge.
What if we were like the other countries?
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
How many years?
This is my brother, Saad.
May God be with you all.
The most important thing
Bonding and brotherhood
Rahal
You're like my brother.
I don't want problems and money.
You have another topic besides the topic your sister is talking about.
You would you please?
Why stroke?
He's right.
It's not permissible for halal from my father.
Yesterday my mom told me about her brother, Saad.
My father is a journalist at the ministry.
It's all thanks to my father.
We have been patient all this time.
This last attempt is pointless.
Your friend Abdullah has angered them.
They respected him, they spoke rudely to him, and they expelled him.

Osman and Salem’s brothers can have a regular court.
But my brothers
They can be afraid of people's words.
It could be annoying to go to court and hear what people are saying about me.
Let’s calm our volunteer soul, عبدالرحمن Ashbitaswi
Welcome!
Speech with her
You don't have the key to the door.
What do you say, my son?
He's telling the truth.
Please, O Allah, go.
I'm going to court tomorrow morning.
Why is tomorrow's deadline?
Then it’s me who decides, not you guys.
Ashbisr means from now until after tomorrow.
Hello, my brother Rashid.
Take it as a word from me
I will harm you.
I threaten them in court.
He's now asking me to go.
Because they messed up, my love.
It's necessary that I go to my sister's place.
What's up?
Well, you told me this what. May God protect you.
The present attendees have submitted.
A very small model of a courthouse.
Please accept my gratitude.
The present attendees have submitted.
Take your anger.
You just said it.
Don't go today.
Leave it for tomorrow.
Please forgive me, prepare this office for the courthouse building.

Goodbye
Today I returned for dinner at my sister's house.
Oh, they agreed to the ministry for his project with Walid.
My dear, tell me, she's flying with joy and I can't believe it.
He told me to base your project on my party when I have it.
Oh God, praise be to God, after destiny, I’m so happy, once again.
Oh, the joy you're feeling now, Abu Waleed.
From the beginning
My dear, tell me, yesterday my heart was filled with joy.
Praise be to God, oh Manal.
I, Abu Wailid, don't get involved in these matters, but God has blessed him with righteous children.
Inshallah, I’ll tell my father.
Forgive us, back to the palaces
I am deficient, like Abu al-Walid.
May God protect you, Mr. Walid. You didn't fail us.
May God bless you and increase your blessings, hopefully.
Good cook, God willing, my son Waleed.
Now, they've assigned you a good accountant and secretary to organize your work.
They told me I’m only responsible for the office’s share and you guys take the rest.
Please be my guest.
My love, he is my eyes.
My blackberry
We want to build a bigger house.
Check out this reply.
Seriously, we agreed that you'll give a speech after the meal.
And gentlemen, with a word from the project owner, Abu Bo Walid, please. Thank you.
Forgive us again.
Congratulations, congratulations, ya boo waleed.
You deserve it, you deserve it, may God bless you, you deserve it.
Honestly, you're just not cut out for business and trade.
Hey man, this project has a story, guys.
How are you?
Look, you know, thank God.

Hello Japanese national team, playing with us
I am at Souq Waqif.

It cancels out if it tells you that the the the computer
I want a cinema.
I need a kitchen, a kitchen, a kitchen.
I'm telling you the day I submitted the catalog of the ministry's committee.
How are you doing with the factory?
I paid them an amount
Introduction means
The most important thing is to avoid arguing with the factory.
I did it, praise be to God.
They gave me a deadline until I can place the first order.
Sorry, I cannot
Do it right.
We're just waiting for his signature on the agreement with Fahd.
What's wrong, the secretary?
He told me, "I'm not continuing."
Order me a coffee
Hey Abu Waleed, you did what?
The problem with Fahd is not known, he might come and might not come.
A day exists.
He doesn't have time.
So, like, come now.
You are the manager here.
I want a falcon to kill me.
It's not necessary for him to sign it.
The entire folder of these files is filling up my desk and I need to sign them with Fawad.
The solution means
May God help you.
The time is two fifteen, Uncle Waleed.
The shift is over.
I don't think Bufehd will come.
May God help you. Come tomorrow.
You're saying that the manager has known him for a long time and his friend
What are you doing?
A Sunni extremist named Samdiq took a picture but at the office.
Explain the time, they are sitting at their desks.
It’s a pity only the flour in their beard.
I'm tired of the office, I'm just a lecture, I'm always a lecture.
They're not doing anything valuable.
What makes the chair move except by Omar Al-Fahd's command?
Yesterday the manager didn't ask about you.
And the interests of God’s creation are disrupted.
Looks like you're heading to them today.
Trouble, God willing.
Every day, a problem comes up for me.
The factory is giving me a deadline.
No, Inshallah, no God, he doesn't say it.
So, and if they ask about you
You guys are just waiting for Fawad.
Check out these files
Everything is awaiting Sheikh Fahad's signature.
I'm expecting today.
Relax, guys.
Go ahead and go for a walk.

If there's something wrong with you in your words, please don't call me, please, don't bother the poor guys.
May God guide you. / May God be with you.
You guys messed up terribly, madam.
Hey boy, from a group of people who approved my appointment.
But like, man, what are you talking about?
Dad, I don't want to miss my daughter's university registration deadline. The scholarship application documents haven't been finalized yet, Dad.
I'm having trouble with the factory, constantly delayed.
You guys, be patient for a while.
All your transactions will be confirmed.
The riyal is drinking his coffee, but as soon as he finishes, they’ll come after him.
Just said, calm down, just said.
Hello, my dear
Goodbye
Guys, like, right now
Just where are you guys going? Wait a minute.
Understand what happened.
What happened then?
I informed him about an important trip.
He has a private door.
This is the situation.
My brother, our interests have stopped, my brother.
Every day, we’re improving Inter Inter Moveed.
What are you waiting for, Fawad?
Your delivery guy is late.
The Lord does not give to those who are ungrateful.
Where did you find it, and where is her?
The factory in Japan
The deadline is ending.
Your aunt is from the other side.
She's poor, her husband left her money.
Where did you find it, or where is it?
Ugh, I'm really scared for my dad.
Don’t let him go there.
Who will speak?
Hello there
By Walid
The factory told me and your wife's money.
Wait for Fahd.
Ya bby, lamma nntar?
Malachi upon their tongue
This is what we've been waiting for, Bader.
Man, you're not being nice to me.
All my friends are working at the university next week.
Shdur yebah
The telephone is broken.
You shouldn't want anything but good things, be patient, just you.
Seriously, who is speaking?
I don't understand.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
You were patient with us a lot.
God helps.
Bo, Walid's condition is not good.
He catches his yacht, which is warm, and he shivers.
The deadline is soon ending.
There are five days left.
He spends all the money on him.
My Lord will suffice for him against me.
Which one is better, which one is better, which one is better
Inshallah, I hope it’s good.
These are amazing stones.
The text above is melting.
The second text under the dome is not moving.
Someone left me out of the hundred percent.
Give me a discount
I don't hesitate
Hopefully, everything will be fine with you.
And my sister didn't fail.
She was eyeing her money a little.
May Allah reward her with goodness.
I collapsed from your beauty but
Our manager appeared to me, may God guide him as a manager.
It seems our manager heard.
God only knows what's wrong with that manager, he's really acting up.
I find her from him, or from Būfahd.
Please God, this is a huge mess.
And tomorrow is the last day.
My money disappears.
We will not deny God.
Direction of the stream of the stream
How did you learn to speak so well?
You brought something from a call.
Uncle Abu Waleed
I'm calling you because you're breaking my heart.
Just stay consistent on the phone.
Goodbye
How long you were a man of integrity.
We were considering you a proverb.
Don't think I'm ignoring your outings every day from work.
I can deduct from you.
And then with this mobile phone
Instead of deducting from you
I put you on the evaluation committee.
I'm going with them today to inventory.
Don't go out of work.
And if it rises
I won't blame her afterward.
Poor him, today is his last deadline.
His swollen arm, his phone is waiting for them to call him.
I'm afraid he'll get fired from his job.
Hey Abu Waleed, my phone was ringing.
It breaks the heart.
He's going, poor thing
Abu Waleed
Oh, human being
What's up, Abu Waleed? I'm not calling you on the phone.
Release your soul and improve your deal.
Don't worry about it.
You guys, seriously!
It seems Daum Bawfeed
Should I do this for you?
This is a senior manager.
Where is he going?

My brother, he is in Afghanistan or Pakistan.

The manager has arrived.
Insha'Allah, we will have sweetness soon.
Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah
Damn, it's finished, my job is over.
I bear witness that you, Abu Saeed, did not fail.
Now, we just want peace, my brother, woe to me, goodbye.
We are here.
What do you want after I extend it for you for a year?
Sorry, sorry
May Allah reward you with goodness.
You helped me for four years.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All the girls have gone crazy.
The last one yesterday amdaoum
Came back now, oh Abu Abdulaziz.
I'm looking for comfort.
And your eloquence is a correspondent.

I'm maybe five years old, I haven't eaten the khnfroush.
Don't be proud.
I smell it in my nose.
Everything you ask for will happen, God willing.
Please direct me to the Human Resources department.
You finished the papers.
Yeah, since yesterday
Because of this, your contract
Man, I'm so bored.
Okay, just let it go.
Don't cut us off.
Hello, little Khaled
From this moment on, that's it.
Inshallah, we’ll relax, my brother, we’ll relax. Oh my God, woe to him.
Sweet, sweet
I'm at work and I can't leave.
You can manage general affairs in human resources.
I have it there.
Your father wants you to take it and deliver it to civil service.
Shukran, shukran, shukran. Mashallah, you're the best!
Where are you going?
My yacht is raining, I'm going to the bank.
And our determination is all of us.
Now
The bank is expecting me.
Throw it at someone.
It doesn't matter that I couldn't go to work.
Okay okay, let's go. Goodbye.
He didn't agree, I think.
He says he can't go out.
How are you now?
Tomorrow morning, as I’m going, I’ll pass by the bank.
I have been learning for these years always.
He definitely feels suffocated.
May God guide him.
You're the one who makes him relax.
Poor Farah is returning home.
He called me and said Khaled.
I need a tahini to finish my transaction.
Fear Allah.
Each person relies on themselves.
My mother is regretting the crazy person.
From here we choose
I'm not regretting anything, my love.
But I'm saying since I left work and this...
Khaled goes and what does he do?
He slept in his room.
Those who were lost at sea
Good morning, my son.
Hello my daughter
Seriously, and may God protect you.
They called me and said the manager is really stressed.
Bring me your high-value accounts.
Hello, I'm happy.
He's telling you that the kids rely on themselves. What's wrong with you? You don't listen to anything.
Don't be lazy.
And upon him be peace.
I am waiting for you and the dust is gathering in front of me.
Today we will eat.
May God guide you. / May God be with you.
Seriously, I forgot to tell you
My love, come on
May God help you.
Yeah, the one who's at the market.
Get out of here as fast as you can.
Come on, my daughter! Come on!

Adapters from the Ministry of Ministry and Government Transactions
Adapj min wazah li wazarah
Transactions of the families
I care for the big and the small, you know you appreciate them.
The people are handling nice, important tasks.
Their time is busy, what should we do?
Every day there is a meeting with the manager, or with the responsible person, or with the minister.
They have some good jobs, but they need a lot of time, oh my goodness.
And streamline your transactions and adapt your skills and a second job, I will make you a stable and quiet person after
Okay, here's the translation: Okay, now, may God reward you.
Now, bye.
Oh God, forgive us, really, oh Ya Bushahin.
They called me just now and said it’s finished.
If you mess up your father tomorrow, the transaction will be canceled.
I'm really late.
Fear your Lord.
Tomorrow is impossible. Tomorrow, I won't be able to.
From my love for you all
Tira is annoying and exhausted from you and your actions with him.
You guys even don't respect the old man's beard.
He's stuck in the room for two days now.
From these alleys and from these suns
May God grant you a good deal.
And soul, be silent and finish it.
Committee that came from the morning until the end of the day
My reputation, mom.
My foundation is delayed, you know.
As long as tomorrow you have your last day for the committee
Your transaction is completed tomorrow.
And at night, come complain to me about them.
Tomorrow he has a joint legal meeting with them.
What's up, Dad?
Tears in his eyes
I didn't cut my hair for my dad.
The committee—they changed their minds.
They said I have no end of the week.
Anyway, tell your father.
Yo, don't go.
I'm going to the committee and they aren't coming.
I can't stand hanging out with this stuff anymore.
He's laughing at him.
Okay, alright.
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm going to him.
Thank you, Dad.
Forever, dude.
Thank you, I'm wrong.
I realized I was selfish after all.
And what's the point of getting tired one day if the committee doesn't come?
You are the good and the blessing.
From today onwards
We are handling our own transactions.
Tiles in the house
And here's your head, I'm kissing it.
Hello hello hello, you book
May God give you a good morning.
Oh, my dearest father.
In the whole world
How are you mad?
Don't be annoyed.
And after like I told you.
I can't get rid of this treatment.
I want to finish it myself.
They told me, "Come quickly."
I'm listening.
With happiness, the Minister
Make her happy, oh brother.
I have problems with these elders.
Oh, my joy, they say my son is with the 'wa' and 'wi', oh my! This is it.
Rely on God and persevere in your work.
Where is Boussaid?
May peace be upon you, brother.
The envelope in front of me is broken.
You're just a pigeon, and I'll drop the envelope with the straw for you.
My love
It means he fell.
It seems he forgot.
The committee will meet after the hour.
May God not guide you.
My son had a hearing with the Minister today. Oops.
Just give me the transaction.
This is my situation: I work all day and night, and the house is for work.
Where is someone?
Peace be upon you.
And you're welcome, please, you're welcome.
Oh my god, I didn't kill him, I didn't kill him at all.
It's a week that's classified, going to the office.
And he tells you, "She's there, in the village."
He goes in the morning
His comfort place there, of course.
I won't add fuel to the fire.
He says a cook doesn't need anything.
And I gave him my soul.
With peace
May God protect you.
May God not harm my uncle.
God bless you.
I'm fine, my love, I have nothing, I have nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
That's at the bachelor's apartment.
And this is going too far.

I'm thirsty, my brother, I want water.
Give me Maymay
My dear children
No, no, but erase it, erase it, I don't want it.
Do not write the pulp.
Let them be circumcised.
Hey girl
You are right.
Goodnight to him
I swear, my dear.
Let me, my sister.
The championship and cup.
And he spoke about the verdicts
My mother is saying where is her son's virginity.
I'll just keep it simple and no nonsense.
The people returned to iOSone.
They say he's a good speaker and they ask him to speak on the radio and television.
And it's even like that.
Take him, hold him, my sister, and cut him up in prison.
My dear sister
My dear, these days no one can help anyone.
Give them problems.
And now, if he dies...
What makes him talk and agree, but it's just nonsense.
Praise be to God for his safety.
The blessed visited us.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, seriously!
Listen up, dude.
Last night all night
I'm warning you.
Now, I just wanted to remind you, dad.
Seriously, man.
It's impossible, I just called.
No radio, no television, not even connected to the internet.
My sister is alive, and she has been in the hospital for two days.
Munira, your wife, has four tears on her cheeks.
Don't tempt me, you fool, have mercy on us, and whoever has mercy on his parents.
Just as you said
It's a mess.
Don't bother to upset me.
Your aunt is named Amina.
I can't go after you went to jail.
And that’s it.
Disclose the malice
Behind the door, he gave it, he fell with him, he had tawala (seeking refuge) from Satan, and hopefully, only good will happen.
He'll grab you by the hand for the second time and take you to court.
Seriously, man.
Repentance after I say
If I contacted on the radio and on the television, I won't blame but yourself.
I cannot fulfill
Let me go now, please.
Just between you and me
The manager told me.
We need to have
This is going to mess up the administration tomorrow.
Let's just mess around a bit.
Okay, so what did the manager say?
He has a million excuses, and every excuse he says.
Where should I go?
But like, it's over, Afnan.
I miss you.
Yes
Goodbye
I am telling you.
You know, Saleh, I killed you.
The general interest forced us to relocate a number of correspondents to the ministry.
You're telling the truth, but...
He just sends you one thing about junk.
It's lovely of you.
It's a mess.
Yes, of course.
You are my haven.
We have work, please.
What the hell is this, Dad?
Leave the matters.
I’m sorry, I don’t understand you. About the cucumber?
What are you making me do, bench them?
Munira was standing and listening as I was saying to you.
Seriously?
I'm hearing them without a word coming out of me from the molasses.
My soul now you are inside.
And let me talk to my dad.
They sentenced him to prison, we said it was wrong and we kept silent.
Silence now, after after what we were told.
Just because we're the people.
Do you know how?
I seek refuge in God from Satan.
Inshallah, everything will be alright.
May God guide you.
I don't want coffee, make your coffee for yourself.
I know you
Bored
Your aunt is giving you two weeks to finish.
"By God, I won't let go of your hand, and if I take you to court to divorce you."
Yo, even if I come out
You're bringing trouble upon yourself.
Bear with it.
Even if one says
Listen carefully to what you hear.
It's just him who's causing all this mess.
Yeah, man, wow.
But they didn't punish me these two days.
Seriously, just tell us something, man. We just want to hear it from you once, just once.
No, just stop.
You guys be the police.
Mom, you're misunderstanding.
My uncle's son has a problem, so we asked him to speak tomorrow on the radio.
He was a little hesitant.
It was nice to talk to him in a public place, so I hesitated.
I said to my cousin that I told him that it would be better to speak to him privately about the house.
You guys sensed that he was trying to say something.
It means hesitant and so on and so forth.
They came from somewhere
But but but but but but but
I am not your mother and I do not know you, and I disown you for the Day of Judgment. Heard or not?
Saleh Saad
No God save you from this, this is over, ugh. Let it go. Thank God.
You feel a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee
Unfortunately
Despite my attempts
Peace be upon you.
Why are you exhausting yourself like this?
I just wanted to grill you, I was calling the secretary to let you know I'm not coming.
Shahin, what's wrong with you?
You don't know what this is about.
Ugh, there's someone in Qatar who doesn't know how to use it, but it's just nonsense.
You are good, but not nonsense.
Don't bother with nonsense.
Hi, the job
But there aren't really any jobs, you know, considering the circumstances, you know.
Come on man, they didn't hire him.
I'm bored, what should we do?
I didn't leave anything behind, God willing, O Munira, I didn't go.
Even one person tells me before I arrive by five minutes, they had a job but they did it, you know? It's gone.
My dear, last night her husband divorced her.
It means my responsibilities have become this big.
After one person, his responsibility became that big.
I honestly don't know what to do, God willing.
He was approaching the minister.
But honestly, I found it wasn't fair.
He'll think I'm afraid of him replacing me.
Seriously, you killed me.
Who told you I was silent?
I just want this to be far away from me.
I'm thinking of a way to kill him.
Finish it once and for all
What is it?
I know it.
My dear, whatever is said on the radio
Bye, I'll send you the message.
You're just a piece of information.
You, Saleh, are a citizen full of national spirit.
You are a loyal citizen.
Thank you.
I've left, God has finished.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I, Boofahd, after I talked to him a little.
Seriously, Saleh
He says we haven't heard him say anything like this in a long time, it's just nonsense.
I want to know him.
This is normal, Saleh.
I am a shepherd in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
Like you, few.
Your words are really nice.
And your words on the radio are much sweeter.
We heard some nonsense.
Measles, oh my God, just one for Buwayhid, there are people saying it now, saying it, listen, listen, listen, listen.
It's nonsense.
This is the original, you know. This is it.
I asked you to keep going, don't stop.
It's a bit difficult.
Then he stopped, that’s all.
I mean, I want it to continue because of people's problems and their worries.
Listen, Saleh
I’m giving you one problem only.
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
Come, I want you to grill. Come.
Senior official, this
Just say it, man, say "okay," say "she's done," God willing.
God, I swear it.
This is your chance.
Opportunity doesn't come twice.
No no means no.
What's up, you don't understand?
Please be patient, man.
From problems and troubles and the high
Oh, Minister of Happiness
The ministry, in its latest project, requested eight thousand Ambops.
The bellows has a capacity of one hundred and twenty cm cm
But this employee
Approved on pipes with a capacity of
In order to benefit from the price difference
It's a mess.
You didn't bother, you didn't bother, oh Saleh, but it's a mess.
May God protect you.
This call is a special order.
Inshallah, you’ll name him/her a good name.
He's messing with stuff, he's messing with stuff.
Do you know?
The house and what you're doing
But this is the last one and that’s it.
Sultan flew friends.
With the speed of the minister's shawl
He's saying something true.
Seriously, now the square in Bofered is playing with his sandals.
I am doing all the tasks.
My dear, how old are you?
The Minister has succeeded.
Goodbye
It's a mess.
Okay, here's the translation: "Seriously, this is the last one, really. After all."
Oh, and these are my application papers, forgive me, cheating.
That's what they were aiming for, and they achieved it.
Listen to me
Because he's afraid.
People talk about him and it's a huge scandal and a mess.
You are identifying defects and criticizing them.
They're afraid of you.
Trick me, my sister, عاشه.
You are the good one.
Tomorrow is your uncle Abu Amira’s.
Condition of working
They don't have a story to justify their criticism and expose flaws.
Why do they hate our country?
Do we have flaws?
We don't have connections.
I'm hearing this word "wasatah" for the first time.
In our government offices, I go up a floor.
We don't have any bribes.
I don't know her.
Look at the employee.
Do foreigners take more than locals never ever?
We do everything we do with our hands.
You are a son of your mother and a son of your father, and we never had a master.
The supervisor will be upset with you while you're on the job.
We are the best people.
Best country
Defect-free
And thank you.
It was a mess yesterday on the radio.
Hey, I want sweets.
I'll give you the sweetest things after dinner.
Seriously, there's no sweetness.
He was tearing his shirt.
Yo, we were just playing.
I know you're playing
What the hell are you ripping your shirt for?
Please God, protect you, O just one.
Come on, come on, look at your brother's kid, what's up?
Whoever killed you, there's no need to buy him expensive. He killed me, no problem, let him come out good.
What's up?
It's useless to cancel this, if this shirt gets canceled, my dad won't like it.
Asweel said what he wanted, of course, everyone hates him.
Seriously, where's the sweetness?
Let's see the crack with deliberate intention until the end.
He returned and upon him was Walid.
He's excited about it. It's his first time wearing it.
I'm in the braids.
Where are the notaries?
In the garden
Why did it happen?
His father in a while.
What are you saying?
Dust on your face
I have a jacket and a hat and a car.
They're always messing with him however they want.

Don't come and insult me.
Teach me.
We are raising them.
About mistakes and respect yourself.
Let me know about it.
You guys are fighting like crazy kids.
Abid Gulf, damn it.
Ugh, you never come in.
Tell him, Airabi, that his family is just, listen, listen to you and to him.
Hey, what's up with this?
Don't let your children and the stick separate between them.
But I realized
Greed is on me, I don't care about you.
Let's go up there.
They don't deserve one.

Please allow one

La la la, this is actually, this isn't cuttable with the hand, you know?
I'm telling you, the heart of paradise is an electric chainsaw.
But I’ll say only, may God punish the one who did it.
I'm telling you.
Who here wants some sweetness? Come on.
I'm going to find out.
If you're still getting to know it, go take a look around the desert.
I don't just love you because you learned how to ride a bike.
I love you because in you there is something else after.
You're saying the truth, right?
So, you want a sweet treat?
My dad has two daughters.
I’ll give you four units.
Who cut our clothes in the closet?
My father and how did you cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors so he can cut the car in it.
Under the bed, all the sweetness.
I've reached this point in our communication.
She's making this blue sauce.
Let's keep it quiet so we can laugh at it.

We must prevail over our words.

What are you saying about her?
The destruction I’ve seen with my eyes is impossible to replace.
Why don't you believe me?
Turn around, turn around.

Every day, my love, I miss you.
Where are you, oh time of my firsts?
Please accept my forgiveness and blessings.
May God guide you.

You're looking for your friends.

The baby is born.
You are my brothers.
Listen to my words and reconcile. Extend your hands.
Hey, what are you doing now?
Good, bird, I tore their clothes.
Their clothes got ruined by that mess he made for me, and it’s really stressing me out about my files, documents, and everything.
God, I won't let him.
I’m bringing you a speech from the museum of Arabic language, God won’t let him leave.
Don't bother with her.
It taps, it taps, it taps, it taps until I get tired and I go.
My brother is awake and I know him.
Everyone greeted each other.
It's from my father's heart, not from my heart. This heart is full of hatred and animosity.
I'm sorry I broke the computer.

Each one has a role.
May God protect you all, may God protect you all.
Even you, Yabo, you've become like them.
Mom, mom, curse my child! What does God command us? You're saying it, stop, stop, stop!
Where are you going? What?
My son is bleeding, my son.
We failed, you guys.
Those who are erased were the children, the children.
He doesn't believe anyone.
I'm understanding with my two eyes.
I'm telling the kids that they won't believe this.
He says from above.
He's a young boy from above the platoon, but from above he thinks he's big.
Seriously, I'm not crazy, I'm awake.
Please, you can go.
You seem a bit tired, or your head is heavy.
You know these people?
Tell me, what cucumber is on you?
Ugh, yes.

Take me to the hospital, I fainted and died.
I’ve seen him before and it’s not the first time.
And I noticed after that it didn't come down from off of you, Hazi.
Hey, was was registered with our business?
But now it's been a week since he's been attending the class with us.
It's clear that he's dying and recognizing you.
Don't be heavy if you're capable of it to that extent.
No, my yacht.
I don't even know what to say about myself to him.
I encountered a young man from a noble family and he breathed heavily on me.
Let things go back to normal, it's better.
Now he's coming after you, and he's completely drained himself on you.
So, yeah, I'm returning the same feeling of admiration.
But I feel like the right opportunity hasn't come yet.
Mom to mom
I stared at you, Jay and Mai how
He's been waiting, you young man, it's coming, he says, "Please, I want you to get to know me."
Bro, be the one who takes the initiative.
Is that true?
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
More than just having registered with her in the same subject
The teacher said.
Say it, O Flannane.
Oh, Alana, come on, what's her name?
We've been looking at each other for three months.
No one knows the other.
Hey man, what's up with you first?
It means you have to go and tell her, if you like.
May I know your name?
He's no longer strong like that.
I really need to wait for the right opportunity to come to me.
Polite and modest
I honestly don't know, what exactly are you looking for?
We finished filming the series yesterday.
God, I swear it.
You never forgot us and you didn't fail us.
Now I'm free.
We're buying the farm behind us, this one for Waleed.
I don't like it if Aitam gets married, the shoes won't go away from me.
Now, what's up?
I was really late.
You are good news.
I came yesterday, what should I do with the door so it won't be sold?
And they developed the country through the Development Bank.
May God bless them, hopefully in it.
Hello my love, good morning.
Hey, man, let's get going!
Thank you, my brother, thank you. May God reward you. May God reward you with goodness.
Hello Nora, welcome welcome, the car is ready, come on, I'm connecting you, come on, come on, bro.
And peace be upon you.
What's your problem?
Neighbors and sitting in Ilsan and with some of your friends what do you tell them
I'm telling you to get out of it, it's for your own good.
Neighbors and hanging out with each other, if you get in between them.
I’m in a nice little trouble, I’m stuck on my car and can’t get it out.
After your permission, after your permission, give me your car key.
After the car is done
I’ll leave you in the Titanic atmosphere you’re living in.
See you later.
Goodbye
Now you've found out a lot about me.
I only knew Walid.
Waleed Rashid Abdullah
For sure, a lot of people would think of you as the actor's son if they heard your father's name.
Mashallah, same name.
My father, Rashid Abdullah, is an actor.
Rashid Abdullah Al-Mufari Abok
Why didn't you have dinner with anyone? Did you eat with these dresses?
Come on, tell me
How did you find out that the famous actor Ra'id Abdullah is Yarana?
Yeah, yeah, right.
Hey my friend, at the university they know them, and she is the one who told me.
She loves him and loves his acting, and she doesn't follow anyone but him.
He said we can’t keep living in one famous shoe that has value in society.
Oh, my heart, my joy.
He's weak, he's weak, his blood is a little bit or yes.
Oh, my God, he's a son, he came out like this, he's like it, and he scared me a lot. May God be of good help.
Truth be told
Driota returned
I need to take pictures with that actor I like, Trion, why?
Hey, I said Abood, my uncle's son.
I came across an article about a meeting in the newspaper.
They say they're filming a series about the days of diving.
I'm asking who brought you decorations for the new house.
Prove that yes the neighbor.
Hala Saleh is doing something new.
We've got a lot of names.
They told me, "May God protect you, everyone, oh Abu Saad. My name is listed."
And it is determined according to the need and the employee’s experience.
We don't know.
We can take you.
I’m sorry, I couldn’t do anything for you.
Not your enemy
We said we'd move and settle down before that, by God, He gave us afterward.
Your work is fair.
Back, my brother Ali
Please don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need
I am at your service.
Neighbor to neighbor, and you are my brother.
But now I heard and saw.
Zain, may Allah bless you, you know about furniture.
He's going to see you.
You don't need to, my dear sister.
When would you like to choose the furniture, tell me.
My father-in-law is asking for a loan and if they agree, they will take all the furniture.
And I will repeat it again
What are you looking for?
We are calculating the people today.
And I want this to not know how to study with my soul.
She just wanted to rely on herself.
I definitely said it.
It shows my upper lip and I tell you, "Call my friend."
Mom, oh Ali
I'm not for anything.
She likes me and I like her. I understand with her.
You are dreaming
Let me marry your aunt's daughter.
Carry on, please.
As you like.
Man, woman
Benjuf
Wishing you a good night.
Are you from your family?
Bouali الخير
Damn, this car is awful.
Every day you come up with something for me.
The girl, may God protect her, has a university.
And this is always a melancholic one.
Your daughter, our daughter
You don't have to.
There's no need to burden yourself, man, Rashid.
May God not guide you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the dude is just chilling without any work.
I’m looking for the Development Bank, they didn’t fail you – a house and a car.
This isn't our car.
Neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car
I'm looking at how relationships have evolved.
Let's discuss the issues of mutual interest that benefit both sides.
Wow, that's an amazing development!
Let's go!
It's embarrassing to come back, mom.
I refuse.
Nourah said, "I'm counting on my daughter, and every day the driver is bringing her to university."
Tell her that my dad’s car needs a week for repairs.
No way!
She says there's no escape for the Deryol every morning, she gets delivered.
Testimony of faith, O Allah, to Ali.
They are good.
Goodnight, Papa.
No power or strength is from Allah but by His will.
This is huge, this is huge. What's happening to me now?
It has many responsibilities and burdens.
My daughter is taking her to university.
Abu Ali, as long as your teacher, Mr. Rashid Abdullah, is well.
We can't say anything anymore.
Boussad Boussad
I'm sorry.
Bouali knows how much we value him here.
Thank you, may God reward you. You didn't fail you, my dear.
Everyone loves you, Mashallah.
God, she's beautiful, she's beautiful.
Guys, teacher Rashid is busy watching a boy walk.
Sorry, sorry Mr. Rashid, you disturbed us or something?
We are at your service, we are at your service.
Who do you have connections with?
We are your brothers and cousins, if we want anything or anything, don't forget us, oh my God!
Tell me where you want it, and I’ll get it for you.
Why are you hurting me?
You are speaking to me of a precious gift.
They agreed, oh my god, they agreed.
Minaalah said her mother about me.
What are you not believing?
Am walid
And dresses, do you have a party?
I didn't understand.
Walid hopes to see with his good eyes, God willing.
Poor girl, she called me
You take accessories
Showcase jewelry accessories
This is my mom.
Now after you install a cool muffler
Mashallah, mashallah
Mashallah, I can't deserve you.
Am waled tera ma sirt wiyaj
I gave you everything I had, and now I’m giving you the car.
And with her, the dates.
So if I go with you, this color, they won't believe that this gorgeous and glamorous queen.
Damn it, man.
Inshallah, you’ll fit into these clothes.
Hala hala hala hala hala faya alij
Without hesitation, leave it to you, you don't know me.
They say this old man is bothering us.
Coffee is a long life.
Bouali, I didn't recognize you, God willing. I said this is for sure, he's one of the cabarets, Yaina, not Bouali. You're not Bouali.
What do you think?
And walking is not far.
May God protect you, those two (boys) we're going to go propose to, for Ali, they have them.
National pride
I've let go of my soul from the reins, the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
The latest series that I filmed
In a scene that was a wedding, mention any wedding.
I’m wearing that black shimmering thobe.
After your father taught me how to wear the pashmina.
My brother, may God protect him, Omar never wore a turban.
Mashallah, aman, aman.
Like, is it that I messaged the group?
I am sorry,
Listen up, my brother Rashid.
You don't have any buttons yet.
Goodness
The one I always see with me and Khulood
The thing is, you know?
I love you, my love.
We are now the people.
And we want our daughter Nuha to go to the Eid.
Nour al-Haq Walid
He tells me, Mom, that he wants to see her at the university and doesn't find anyone better than her.
This blessed clock
Inshallah, I’ll tell the truth, by God. May God write what is good.
Why was it rejected? What was the reason?
My father is an actor.
May your father be in peace.
Raashed says it quickly.
Where are you?
He screamed in agony.
You're saying because his father is an actor
Don't you dare shame your people
I am an actor.
But act as if you were the most dignified.
I will perform on stage for two hours and my turn will end.
My performance is over.
You're playing roles.
I am acting.
I will present them with a useful message.
But you guys
I wear costume clothes.
On the stage
But you guys
You represented him well in the lawsuit.
The wealthy princess
Who is the actor in us?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Walid.
Lift your head
It doesn't honor us.
But you missed the view now, and I'm just here.
And listen, as it screams at him, don't pay attention, don't pay attention, poor thing, breaking hearts.
She walks.
You say "جنة أحسان"
It's Thursday, guys.
Thursday
She doesn't agree with me.
I envy him.
That's why it works like this.
So the women don't see it, or the women don't see each other seeing it.
I saw how her husband Aminenthe was caring for her.
She doesn't look back.
But tomorrow I will go to the office.
Please, Khamees, please, how did they wear the stey?
Khamees Farjuni on his outfit (wearing a vest)
You call her your wife, but you actually call her a Stassi dress.
Ya Allah, alhamdulillah, it's Thursday.
With an open soul, be well.
Poor thing, honestly.
You're always like this.
If you hear what's being said behind your back
Laa mashallah hatta jaddami, yequlun mumkin akthar ba'd.
Ugh, why am I doing this?
I envy you.
I envy what.
How long should I sit in front of the television?
This is. Oh.
Seriously, truly.
Okay, here's the translation: Lala عادي
Hello dear sister
Twin beans
Now I'm in front of you, I'm talking to you and I hear a man's voice.
I often find myself interrupted while dressing in the morning.
Respect yourself and let her go.
It's difficult to release it.
There is nothing. There is nothing. There is nothing. There is nothing. There is nothing.
Do not approach me, do not approach before me.
What the hell?
My intention is good.
You were arguing from
You're the only one I can stand besides these looks.
Especially this, this is from the heart of your brothers, I’ve been supporting them all with my life, God, this sweet, talkative man.
The figs that resemble a newly sprouted paradise.
Jalil al-hiya allatī ma yastahi
I want you to torture me in my grave.
Let me talk to her
After you finish, tell me.
I understand with you.
I'm not giving anyone here.
How are you? What's happening?
Khamees Rafeejna Yan
I want to watch the flood and listen to his conversation in his heart.
I'm saying the limp in his head is "cluck cluck" up there.
This Thursday is pitiful.
He was walking with his mother in front of him and sitting and talking to her.
God will suffice against his wife.
They say Thursday is yours.
Now he's busy with an international call, so I'm ignoring him completely, even the line might get cut off.
And her face, the one with the message
I say, may God guide you, Ya Khamees.
What's up, you weren't sleeping?
I don't have a nodule, God willing, I don't even know. It's not coming to me.
Regarding listening to you tomorrow
With the delegation of women who are in the ministry
Could it mean?
May God guide you, but oh, خميس.
These names are coming from the Minister's office.
And then come.
You're freaking her out, and she's scared of you.
If I had arrived safely, I wouldn't have been scared.
The truth
Ugh, why are we going in and messing around behind the water tanks?
Just like this
Ka shufti aqr aqr aqr akhir raqm fi al al 'indaj?
Last number
The last number you called after you deleted the number from the previous time you contacted them.
Tell me her name, you guy with the women.
قت لج قت لج قت لج
I told her about Salem.
Peace be upon you, my colleague, in the work.
I couldn't believe you, man.
And what are you wearing?
I want to go diving.
"By God, brother, she didn't let me wear anything but told me to go out like this."
Call me
Call my wife
My wife
Say it, my brother. Give me the pen, and I'll give you the number.
Manage yourselves
This is you guys, you braggarts.
You're one Loti like him, but I show you.
If you intervene again, I won't answer except the Minister's office.
This is Spanish.
And he threatens me by saying that I complain about him at the Minister's office.
Seriously daring this.
This is planning to cut off my livelihood, you know.
But I’m the one who’s wrong, the one who listened to you and called her.
Empty promise, oh Thursday.
If you complain to the Minister's office
They were there and said everything was out of the situation, they took me out of the situation.
I don't have anything to do with it.
Don't be afraid.
My brothers and sisters
Good morning to all of you.
It is my honor to have you listening.
Where are the rest of them, though?
Damn it and screw it
It's Thursday, and it's ending.
May you live long.
Phone sugar
Enough, don't dress up, leave the office.
The whole meeting is one hour.
This is my phone.
It became and it stood, it became.
I have an appointment with you today and won't be at home.
Where is he going?
It can go.
Zak today is still in the same situation.
He’s jealous, he’s jealous of him.
My love, this isn't like him.
Yaleh ahni fi al-salah fil-layl abroho
He tells me to chat with my mother.
My mother is dead.
That’s why you’re leaving so I can find a solution for you.
I've been asking you to move from the department where women are.
An executive order is
AKA JOFFI THE SIGN BIGGER READ UNDER
My brother, please could you transfer me to the psychiatric care department?
Are you sure you're connected to the care department?
Why strange
Thank God, keep you safe.
You are the woman, excuse me, Mr. Khamis.
Contact us from the Minister's office and let us know.
You've arrived at your new section.
And with you, your whole crew is at the office.
Yusif, Saleh, and Jasim and
Thursday yesterday the Minister Al-Muqarrar for your transfer
Today, your colleague is in your new department.
I explained to you about the problem I have with my family.
You are the Minister's transformation.
I'm going to the minister.
Today I took my annual leave.
And Maher is talking about the events after six and a half months.
That’s a predicament.
And you want my opinion, and I also agree.
The minister is saying the same thing to you.
I’m looking for a place for you this time because they told him about your problem and your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And the solution
They say if the wife calls me, you don't answer.
You should not ask them to save you, please.
They made me put you in the car. I put you in a box.
Alone together
I put ten for her, assuming you guys are five in the office, so each one for two.
What's his shape though, he's dying from his wife, he's afraid of her.
Imagine we all wear beautiful dresses
My name is Abd El Gadir.
It's his name, written on a palm.
He's handsome and sweet, you know, so you're scared of him like that.
Bismillah, hay ashfiha.
If you call, I will answer.
Hey Abdulqader, you're walking behind Khalil, and you're doing well from where you are.
This game, you pick what you want.
Joffi here
Fares Abukhamm
What's up, what's happening?
Excuse me, please.
Where is the care office?
It should be five employees.
What is your name?
I am good.
I'm in love with my wife.
I'm heartbroken.
You are now, let the project fly before us.
We joined them.
So, what did they say to you?
They said
Nice to see you, how are you doing?
I can't.
I went into the kitchen and followed it.
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, Ya Allah, please do what is coming, Ya Allah.
Seriously, seriously, seriously, what a mess.
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, listen to what the men are saying, listen to them.
Oh, and don't forget that we are Beni 'Aqrab.
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, I came, I am without thanks, Ya Allah, Ya Allah, Ya Allah, Ya Allah, Ya Allah.
The bank said the project has no outstanding issues.
He's called, his phone is busy.
Poor souls who are waiting for you
I'm having a problem with this guy and these brothers.
She was supposed to be away for a month, and now it's been three months.
God is Rima, God be with you.
All the amendments are in our favor.
boy’s
Hey, just let you know if you make the garden
At least he's going somewhere, at least two or three places.
They say that the garden is considered a breath of fresh air for people who live in this complex, it's the Bank...
They are arguing, they don't need a woman's opinion.
Okay, here's the translation: خلي رايج لج
You put the tea so we can see you appear, feeling well.
Garden la
Just one minute
My dear, do you know that I love football?
They and their brothers don't know you're playing ball at school if they find out they'll kill you.
I know myself
She said to
I'm saying it's better to forget the topic.
Don't look at yourself.
La la la, I've been thinking about you.
What are you saying? What are these occupations in this world?
You should be our blessing.
Oh, Uncle Shawyen, we have
Wonderful.
This is Thursday.

Origin and separation
I'm telling you something.
I have an engagement on Thursday.
This is from the Human Resources department.
Yes, you are beautiful.
Let's it to the side.
Then, I noted some observations on the proposal.
May your life be long.
You have something after.
You are not old.
Take care of them, and if I have time, inshallah, I will meet with them.
What are you doing with the female employees you sent to you?
Best friend
I'm going now and then I'll call you.
It seems
You are amazing.
We are your sisters bigger than you.
I've been suffering for ages.
Do you know when they ask me weird questions about what kind of sports you play at school?
I told them to set the table.
Just so you know, they didn't kill her.
The bread that comes with this is appetizers.
You don't know who we are.
What is our origin?
Do you know what watch hands are?
This time, we ruined it together.
Big Spider

My grandfather, let's give her a punch in the face.
Enough, you're messing around.
You're saving up for later.
You said you changed it, you're going to become an architectural engineer like me.

My brother, Falcon, is taking his chance.

They will be ashamed after
Shudur ya saqur, inzal.
Oh my God in front of me in front of me
Where am I going?

Where are you guys going?
We said to Jab and no word.
And you write instead of her, raising her.
And if needed, sedation, if it becomes apparent we have no objection.
Conflict after
You have two options.
so you know that we are demographers
You say you're under pressure.

The scorpion incense, eyebrows, a robe, spoke to you.
Don’t be brief, my uncle, but when is the event, God willing?
Professor Amina
What you're asking me to see is very difficult.
I can’t travel, Abu Khaled.
I have special circumstances.
The minister is insisting on it.
It's really hard.
Think justly, O Maryam.
Don't make a decision right now, think about it tomorrow.
Hey, how are you working?
That's why they're quiet.
I have a suggestion.
Send one of them to go with you.
We don't have any girls who are going to travel.
Turki, what a mess.
No shame at all.
Shame on those who are still causing problems at work.
I'll go and apologize.
When I don't receive
Listen while you're silent.

She’s doing it.
Tomorrow is Jummah, InshaAllah, the pilgrimage.
We'll call you and tell you the time is about to arrive according to the Sheikh's team's shifts.
Oh, that's a funny laugh.
Give me clothes to you.
Give me your clothes, you idiot.
He made me laugh so hard.
My brother is begging you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Make us a coffee and cake.
Who is he now, O Aisha, compared to his minister girlfriend?
I'm afraid it's a rumor, Mr. Khaled.
Amena is a candidate who will hold a ministry position in the new cabinet formation.
Amenire deserves it.
Inshallah, I hope it doesn't become an epidemic.
You're working tomorrow.
We all cooperate to serve the homeland.
By giving from each of us in our position, thank you.
I wish us all the best.
Thank you, Minister.
Thank you, temperature of the sacred one, the minister's effort.
Thank you.
Her longest life was blessed. Blessed.
Peace be upon you.

China is traveling
Captain Jane Abeishi China
May God bless you.
Your sister is playing an important match.
This is what she was studying education, but today I went and transferred her transcripts.
Khaleeta studies marble with architects.
Hey Captain, there's no difference between the rial and the mareh.
Wa Allah, sab al-qahwah bass sab.
Come on, where are you going?
I'm waiting and I'm longing.
You are a donkey, you are a donkey.
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, go and greet your mother, saying "Expel them."
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, not your father, not your mother's father.
By God, it's terrible.
The pot you have is cold.
They don't know you in the whole year. I found out and as soon as they heard you had a job.
How are you? How are the kids?
She was delighted.
I told her that, God willing, this time you’ll be with us on the series.
Of course and I'm working for the championship.
Hey Ali, don't let anyone play with you, just focus on your fire.
My love is obsessed with something called makeup, and she's really into it.
Mary is twenty-six, I don't know seven twenty-seven episodes.
Let him/her feel the heat, my father.
He keeps giving us lectures, morning and night.

The most important thing is that no one knows that the company presenting the series is yours and Hamad’s.
Inshallah, I haven't been late, my brothers.
Wako Rashad and Ray
The director is ready with the technicians, nothing is missing.
Okay guys, just for the sake of time, let's start listening.
Whoever wants to speak up should express his opinion and be patient.
Junk hamed to be say something
Honestly, I don't think there's anything better than this series.
Come on, let her go. This maid committed suicide.
And you know, that scene had the biggest impact on me.
Housemaid suicide
Her soul became attached to the dough, the dough was shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, and blood was oozing, oozing, oozing, from her neck.
She was proud and shouted at her son, God willing, it was action.
He sat and sat and sat until he reached their house.
Top action
Iwon el-sharrah eifteshon imsakoon al-am.
Honestly, the series is absolutely amazing.
You're all performing well on the set, you're representing the show at the table, you're portraying it.
This is a violation of the artistic soul.
And rape the values of society
A series based on unusual events
Unverifiable
Episode 72, Case of Murder
What's with all the commotion?
You're not even known for wanting anyone to come out to you.
Oh, oh, my brother Hamad, let's be democrats.
I've settled the matter by a majority vote.
Hey brother Nasser, don't hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy and majority.
You got caught up in your judgment and your government job in this whole thing.
Goodbye
I'm telling you, I heard the sound of the bell.
And on that day, a Hindu emerged, with Jess in his hand.
He asks me, he says, "You are Mama Hissa." I told him.
I opened the gym
There's a ring, I think it's worth about fifty-eight thousand dollars.
I'm afraid that Indian is bringing these things over by mistake.
It's not a mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamid's wife, the one we have at the company.
May Allah protect you. Here is a gift for you.
How are you?
The ring is very luxurious.
I never dreamed of having a ring like that.
May God protect you, Ya Hassa, my darling.
This is my dad, this series I call "The Series of Goodness."
Ali and Hameed were important to the production company, but because they were employees within our company, they couldn’t submit the series under their names, so they submitted it under someone else’s name.
What comes after this ring?
I'm just telling you, the matter should be between you and me.
Seriously, am I saying something to someone?
Twin stars
The one they call the magician
Five hundred percent, grilled.
My love, they're beautiful if they agree to four million.
I would get two hundred thousand good riyals.
I'm saying the role of the university student is to give Nada
I wish you were here with me on a bicycle.
Our series that we are working on after its name is the violation of conscience.
Someone told me about a role in a series.
Zain wants to know one thing.
It's always like this in our Gulf series, like I say, the harassment this year is rape.
It's important to tell me, my love, what my role will be.
You are my girlfriend, you are always 100% organized.
Come on, spare me the embarrassment.
Kani ya ya now
My love has come back now, she's making me this delicious breakfast, she's taking care of me and going.
This is Omar, the director's secretary.
May God protect us.
He never asked me this way before.
He said that the series he's making is weak and trivial.
Don't let him waste all our money.
And then, I mean, what was supposed to happen
God protect me, I don't know what to say to them. I'm afraid that this crazy Rashid told them something bad about the series.
I'm not afraid of you.
Delete this problem on
Sick man
Binding series
I just saw this on TV a few days ago, it was messed up.
You will.
The series that’s showing now is called “Rose’s Abduction” and it’s not finished yet.
But the budget they're asking for is really huge.
A large budget is needed.
And don't forget God. May God protect you. The organization that produces the work is a local institution.
Allah protects you. Abida says:
Take it easy, old man.
I read the art page
We are hearing these days about the start of filming a series about the rape of the soul.
And he was allocated a huge budget.
It is said that the series is not up to par.
And the last one says that the series is a school for teaching deviation.
There is a big chance they will stop the filming.
Hello everyone.
Peace be upon you, Hello hello Abdul Hamid
Welcome, welcome, rest!
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
I am journalist Eili Minar and I have an appointment with Ustaz Hamed. If it’s okay.
I’m just going, but take a little break because he’s having a seizure.
Mercury allows us to leverage design and create a cosmic space.
And as a courtesy, we will contact all the correspondents around the world to connect with them.
This job of yours is finally finished.
For Al-Athar Company for Artistic Production
And a discussion of its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works that have ever passed in world history
Give a donation, seriously, from the person who wrote this.
If you don't have shame, do whatever you want.
The eye is embarrassed.
Seriously, we have journalists like this?
The expected journalist should have a principle.
Hey, I'm here.
What are they registering for parking?
Yesterday I met you, O my beloved, the Minister’s wife. You know how troubled I am.
I'm telling you, our drama series "Aisyah" is "Aisyah" and its events are strange.
I’ll post episode one and discuss it with people.
Hey, what's up?
Seriously, Mom, my patience is running out because this is only the first episode.
Man, someone only talks to themselves in Gulf Arabic TV series.
And then my mother said, "Stay, and slaughter my sacrifices if you have them."
My son, art has taste and doesn't involve bizarre situations that they bring and generalize to society and people.
Seriously, this might be good for visual arts, but in drama, it's just not it at all.
Oh, my head hurts.
He looks like a Turkish Greek.
I can't, Dad. I don't control it anymore. At least fill the first five chapters.
The Fallen Series
It's a shame to see our sons dealing with such things.
Seriously, brother, he's not like that.
Yama has worse series than him and he gets angry.
This work, oh Salim.
God has made a mistake with you.
And I’ll take every house
Go get people who understand dimensions and subtleties of fonts.
And they revered them.
It's unclear what
Let's pray.
The Minister and his entourage went.
I went to say hello to him.
We're the ones who agreed to the series.
Let whoever likes it enjoy it, but the minister's happiness.
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My friend is the one who posted the insults.
I only reply to messages that praise the series.
No worries, I never worry.
Tomorrow I will post the written text and I will post messages from me, praising in the series and I will tell that these readers should send.
Insha’Allah
You’ll be happy.
This year
We agree with that.
Best TV series in the history of Gulf drama
They are all in agreement with them; the Minister exerted himself.
I’m walking with you, agreed with the journalists
Titles Titles only
I wish to re-rape the conscience.
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series.
I wish they would redo it again.
I was first contacted by the Minister's office.
The remaining payment for the funds of your series is out for you.
They are sending me the smell of the wizard.
And now they haven't found anything.
We finally got into the money and we've been winning, and the profit was excellent.
And then the series is a failure.
The author himself said to me that he regrets it.
I'm now suggesting a second part of the series
The Minister is between you and me.
They talked about the press and the fake success we achieved.
And he told me, "Don't expect to be comfortable inside the series."
It’s impossible for them to approve a second part.
If the minister himself doesn't request a second part.
I cannot.
However, I reiterate my thanks
To all employees
In this series
And I congratulate them on their victory.
What they deserve
The truth is that this company winning these awards at these prestigious festivals
It is the biggest proof.
Tell me what you're saying.
He's not an easy guy.
The Golden Prize is sponsored by Al-Ammah and Al-Ammah.
Ashkan is saying you.
The readers are saying whether they agree with me, and the press is saying whether they agree with me.
They say in a second part why don't they say it?
As long as you have these Arab and Gulf television festivals, you’re doing laundry of art.
Laundry art
I hear about money laundering.
The art of it
Illicit funds
The same series.
What do we do with Won and Two?
How are we going to do this?
We definitely have a contract with them, they must abide by it.
Write to them
Our products are exported abroad in all types of roti, small and large bread, triangular and shaped bread.
We are stuck with their contract.
Two million dollars
What are you doing with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of the roti.
They told you what product it makes?
"And they told me roti, but the roti has something made with flour, I don't know."
May God protect you, your roti is great.
You should call it correctly.
Instead of you taking this roll that you call a sandwich
This is the inventor's thought, make it easier.
Rothy jeans
This secret
You are eating roti with the gravy.
Man, they're doing really weird things.
This dough’s processing is a technique where you first add the yeast to the water.
And there are different flavors of strawberries, cheap strawberries, cheap strawberries, coming strawberries, cheap coffee.
I'm telling you, I'm investing a lot in this project.
Three million dollars with patent rights
Come, Samah.
Yeah, Abunasser
At your service
Wadi'nah al-Nahradah ya taweel al-'umr
What are you saying, Samah?
Take your son Nasser out yesterday to play some basketball with the team, which he's making.
I agree with him.
I made this team because they messed with us, but from security and the drivers.
And after that, we consider ourselves incomplete because we only have one guard, and if he gets injured, we're in trouble.
And I have a fan page link
You took the employees who your mother counted to seventy-ten.
I told you something.
About the important people in the company
Who forms the heart of the company
The baker's dough for the hospitals.
And upon all of it, secure the boy.
He has a flaw that won't happen, you're a son of a well-known family, you can't go wandering and getting mocked by the world.
Whoever wants to play with them, they make whatever they want.
But it doesn't take the important people who form the company's heart.
My team, Shaswi Yame, has a game and I'm missing four players.
We don't want excuses.
What happened, happened.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, Master.
I rode with him.
He told me to wear it.
And a Cameroonian stopped me in the middle of speaking.
The match looked
I didn't feel anything until then.
They told me a ball went over but I don't remember.
You used to play goalkeeper, right?
Just for Nasser
No power or strength is from Allah but by His will.
May you be afflicted with hardship in your ball and all sorts of nonsense.
From today, Nasser.
There’s nothing called football.
Your team, this person you're acting like a mess.
All the bakeries returned.
What about you?
Damn it!
I don't want to hear from you.
I asked you, O Abu Nasser.
Let us hear what the boy is saying, please.
For you only, oh Abu Ahmad.
I see what you're saying.
Tomorrow we have the last match in the tournament that we are playing.
Don't break his heart, Abu Nasser, please. I'm begging you, please.
Come on, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations.
Dear Master Nasir, I want you to be a friend.
God bless you. Today’s team was on time.
Mr. Naseer needs
You promised to throw us a party.
Would you like me to call and book a hall for you at the hotel?
I’m going to put the journalists and the newspapers right there, all together.
No, Rashid, we'll do it here at the Milas.
Because my dad is the joy, the games, and the victory, he can make the team continue.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup
May God hear you, but only when you speak.
I saw pictures with the players and had a press meeting with them.
Waqo Jannah Sami, the sports page editor, is going to meet with him.
What's the picture?
It's too far from me.
Ya Allah, please make the picture look good.
He says he's not happy.
How do you feel about your bakers, your friends, scoring this big goal?
With fighting spirit
The effort
And loyalty to bakeries
Bo Nasser means they were humiliated. We witnessed the bakery team swallowing defeat four to four two.
And loyalty to bakeries and its training plan
Thank you, Mr. Abu Nasser.
May God protect you.
The guard.
That's a meeting about the Babylonian and Assyrian heritage and artifacts, they're coming to meet with you.
Tail is not for the council
Dell sent their representative to meet with you.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup
Tadri Hanna anshaj' al-shabab
Inshallah, you will see him in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
Mashallah, your phone doesn't shut up and your pictures in the newspapers – blessed are you! This ball is amazing.
Do you know what he told me?
He came down and told us, "Tamer, Abu Nasser, the ball."
Now, I've become famous, and the newspapers only put my picture in if they write "Sponsor of the Best" first in the international bakeries.
I am far from the ball.
What is this talk about?
I was from the time I was in secondary school.
My shoes were playing soccer.
You're saying to stay away from the ball.
As long as my shoes are playing soccer, I'm close to the ball.
I mean, I'm going to the gym soon, I'm a gym-goer.
That’s it, then we became international bakeries, we became international stadiums.
Yesterday I heard him saying that he wants to build a sports club.
Of course, let's translate that. Naturally, and today we meet the owner of the bakery, Mr. Abu Nasser, at the International Bakeries.
Developing football
Of course, here’s the translation: We talked to you before the match to find out your predictions and before you reach the platform.
The match is difficult today.
And the team that controls the text line will today be a high Kaaba.
Insha’Allah, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud, listen to me, please. Hurry, hurry! About the seriousness of the matter. Hurry, hurry! Upon him.
Listen up, man. The deal that just happened, for the players, the shipment that's coming to us.
What did we gain?
I when I gave you the prices
The prices we sell to the world
It means, like, the Gulf isn't like the world, you know?
Of course, law.
Seriously, what's your problem?
You're everything I need, just let me know when the Gulf buyer arrives.
Leave the fox open.
Among them, two are defenders, one is a midfielder, and one is a center-back.
Look darling, I'm telling you about the players of the four-leaf clover.
Three of them head
Mitten F
They took all the dollars in one go, like jackets.
How much would six hundred thousand dinars I give you in a jacket five hundred and fifty thousand dollars?
This is nice. This is regarding the Afar people. Now Yina of the Brazilian.
This is the player of the season, this Ibrahimovic with a million and two hundred thousand dollars.
They've put it on sale, but the problem is that I'm sending it to you and showing you where it is. It's above the top, in its depth, I'm sending it to you, God forgive you, from the Emirates.
You are the owner of your own misfortune, and your misfortune is your own.
Thank you.
Mashallah, you came, you came, you’re a man.
How are you?
Knee, Knee
The knee is fine, the knee is fine.
We don’t argue after they’ve formed a holy bond or anything.
Hey Abu Naser
What is the spinal muscle?
They’re really good, open, come on, don’t be stingy.
Honestly, Bo Nasser, you guys are amazing, really good players. Bless you, bless you.
God bless you.
I'm saying the storage, the storage, these boxes, come on, the storage.
Mashallah, you have another business?
La la la, just players, just.
Where can I find creatine?
Branches of yes, branches of weeping from where from the thickets of Africa
Oh, yes, why indeed
It's over for one cartoon.
These are people like us
He's telling you about something he heard.
They're all crazy.
Now that we are
Why don't you give us this bud/sprout thing? They're advertising with them.
I'm saying my father, Abu Nasser, you are this now if if you take care of him and raise him, it will benefit you.
Then the national team will go then they will run this on the field
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Roast him, roast him, roast him. They say he's tender, tender.
Put it in the Python appendix. Goodbye.
Anything you need, the players are all here at my place.
If this coach, Malik, understands
We won two to zero, we're controlling the game.
Seriously, this is a trainer in Spain.
I didn't like her.
The successful coach
The player who is out of position during the match
The north, for example, is like the inverse of the line of the homeland.
Honestly, your coach isn't something you can just do as you please.
Ugh, ugh, the coach hasn't been with the team for two months.
We need to see a solution for it.
If he understands the ball, he doesn't play the sides, he's not playing the whole length of the match; he attacks from deep.
And I'm relying entirely on my ambush point.
Oh my God, and may God return your greeting, don't hurt my head.
One should pull Kakonomala-abu-yeh.
And I put Shinamawa bubbles here and there, making him/her/it.
No no no no no until maybe he can play
Shololo habobo tapa lava khallo iyuli.
Which line
According to the plan
Well hello hello
Something that shouldn't be, shouldn't be between the manager and the team coach.
The match today and the team's star player are scoring a super hat-trick, may God bless you, Jacob Manande.
How do we mean we don't understand a thing?
Listen, Sultan
He is going home.
I can't reach you in my car, the bakeries should order a taxi.
Okay, here's the translation: Done, boss.
Lord, stay with me on the line.
That's why my dad did that.
The coach and I sat there.
What next?
The team is destroyed.
May peace be upon our team.
Oh my god
He said, "Come here, you, I'm telling you, I'm divorcing you. Tell the truth."
From the first day I saw it, I told my mom that this rial didn't impress me.
I feel like it's not my responsibility.
Let's cut the unnecessary talk and focus on the present.
The Spirit of God, His father, find out the matter from Him why did your daughter divorce?
May God give you strength, brother Rashid.
But what made him shoot her like that?
Lala, it's not allowed, oh Abu Abdullah. We need to know why the daughter was divorced. It's our right to know.
Please, you don't interfere, it's not yours.
How come I can't get in and the real estate is going down the mill, and someone wants to know why her daughter divorced?
Those who are not known cannot be married or respected for their feelings.
Who is the owner of Barcelona?
Don't make me wait, I don't know who speaks Spanish.
Barcelona is not just one thing.
This is a Guardiola team.
I'm going to go see the guy who's waiting for me at Mills now.
If you don't go, I'll go. That's it. Stay here. You don't know how to raise your daughters.
He knocked on the door, but no one answered for you to have a headache like that.
Ugh, it wasn't enough that she left Barcelona FC.
Messi is a football magician who doesn't play a match without scoring a hat-trick.
Maradona said that Messi will be better than me.
My daughter, who doesn't shame her face, is being accused of making mistakes, look.
Your daughter is neither a Barcelona fan nor from our town.
Do you mean what you said?
Listen to me, God give me peace.
To be your intention that your child
He will apologize to her and show her.
Don't
And then, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
If we have money, we will make our son happy in it.
Oh well.
I promise to marry you a girl who is from Barcelona.
Hey, I'm not bothered.
You don't understand, my love, it's over. Forget her, she's in the sixties now.
Hack Jaye Hack Ya Yeme
You know, mom, the importance of the losers
You are the only one I want.
Hey man
It breaks my heart.
Poor thing, it hasn't been married for only two days.
After a marriage that only lasted one month, you bastard.
What's wrong with you? Why do you want me to get involved with him?
Ugh, I don't want to deal with him.
You said all this nonsense to me, it's beyond belief.
It's nothing you need to worry about.
I don't know if this is going to be a boy.
It's a beautiful thing
Blessed her.
You’ve told me about the building I wanted to buy and turn into a furnished apartment hotel.
اي اللي ف المنصوره
His right means tomorrow when his son takes our daughter and he asks for the house.
And if you can't
Call your brother.
Listen to me properly.
My father is a millionaire.
Do you know what a millionaire means?
Opportunity doesn't come twice.
You know that someone charged the battery for them in Spain, but just so they could spend every year there?
Okay, here's the translation: "So, like, what's up with Barcelona, you know?"
The family of the girl could have examined this scan on it to prove that their daughter is innocent.
But even if we assume the matter is true and the real estate loves Barcelona and has loyalty to Catalonia
It is expected that her wife respects this.
Are you messing with the team?
This if we assume the matter is true
God is his father, and his name is Abu Burj, because he is on the cornice with two towers.
Let's do this, let's make it weird like a rope wrapped around each other.
The people of Java, who have been deprived of it from afar, consider them as one tower.
She is the best, she is beautiful.
Praise be to God who is with us.
Please forgive me, but could you offer me something? Please.
Thank you darling
But just let me know, Abdullah Al-Oudi’s sight is waiting for your response.
No, my mother Abdullah, don't worry, my dear eye.
If I were to search for a council like yours, I wouldn't find anything better than you.
Ya Allah, they keep presenting us with their awards for building the house.
I’m done with you, Tamer, for your whole life.
They call you from family.
Check out their wedding requests, the cake is ready and I’m signing it.
Bismillah, Allahu Akbar, Bismillah, Allahu Akbar, after your blessings, O my friend, after your neck.
After Abdullah’s divorce response
Hopefully the children and hopefully the money.
May God bless you, my aunt.
You should wear it for the cold.
I don't even know where my mom booked us.
Seriously, I'm saying where did you book us?
My mom says she booked a trip to Malaysia for us.
What about Malaysia, let's go!
Goodbye
Is anyone from the honeymoon month shouting?
What up, mom, tell me
Tell me what's happening, my love.
I'm so nervous, Mom.
Why does she see herself like that?
She's arrogant, let her be herself.
Hey, you did a good job by getting her to her parents' house.
It broke my heart.
Hi, but
What's the problem with that?
It has a scar
May God protect you, don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain, okay?
Is Spain where are we going?
Okay, then.
My mom says she booked us a Maldives flight.
Oh man, it's alright, mom, after the Maldives is nice.
And by the way, would you go to visit us at the mosque, hopefully at the mosque?
Now I said you're coming back and you're excited about the trip.
My inner stomach, oh my God, why does it take the kids?
Come, take your bag.
They are arguing among themselves
What's wrong, my dear?
Don't you, and this amazing woman, are teaching me about my son's face.
What's wrong with you, mama? What's bothering you?
I didn't see the shells and I was sad.
I haven't met anyone like you before, my love.
Let her go, just let her go. It's not your concern, your dad's a lot of money, and a lot of girls.
You, and you, my dear. I know him well, and I find it fascinating. He certainly doesn't bother anyone.
My soul, my mother, call her and divorce her.
May God guide her.
Repeat and say it three times.
You are asking for a divorce, moment by moment. Do not contact me again after this once.
Talaq talaq
I am very nervous, God willing.
Oh, my love, go, I give you to God, go and rest, and take the worries from your mind. The girls are all watching, whoever carries it like they say, go, my love.
Uh, problem
Just so you could see me at the dance.
Keep on it, keep on it, let me argue with him.
Shadq 'Ali, my mother, please, he said you are divorced, he said you are divorced.
I'm dying! You're so shameless, you really have no shame.
Now, just dancing isn't enough, you know?
And sometimes, when necessary, I shake a jar and it’s empty.
What's going on? What's happening, I mean? The world has turned upside down.
I'm telling him that I didn't go to his house yet and washed his sails, and then I don't know if you're a girl.
I am I, O Abu Abdullah, my daughter is divorced.
My daughter is pregnant.
I'm producing on her head, its feathers.
Sell them to you and buy them from Toys "R" Us.
Like you're burning up over your girlfriend and getting angry.
And they did nothing, poor things.
What will you get for the peeled apple?
It’s fine to shoot them however you like.
It is said that Real is his.
This is normal in sixty days, let him tell you.
Drink from the cup that the servants of God drank from.
The things you wouldn't admit to yourselves
Do not tell them.
I used to know that the committee was from there.
In a strategic location
Oh, leave it to God, just in case.
No, and price it cheaply.
I am standing
You must obtain Abu's approval.
Yeah, man, your book, I went to his office and didn't find it.
I went to him the week before, and they told me I was going to travel.
Are you two coming tomorrow after tomorrow? I'll be standing there. The problem requires your approval via Abu Saqr.
His soul is sweet.
No no no no this is official work
May God protect you. The office is not the house.
After eating
Abu Saqr has returned, completely exhausted.
Listen to each one and give them a key.
Oh, my brother Fahd, I’m saying
You don't know me.
Tell me about it, tell me, I don't see it except on television and you didn't tell me you were with him on the pilgrimage.
But like, we don't have that knowledge.
May God cut off your tongues.
May God guide you, and you didn't even believe it, you pulled the starter. At least ask someone to fix this stomach.
After she, this event, God guided you.
The month has thirty days, and it makes dinner fifty times.
I suggest you put me in a Guinness Book of World Records book.
The only person in the world who makes dinner.
Don't you tell me who this guy you're with is?
Welcome, this is the best time of day, by God.
The honor is ours, may you live long.
Hey, Abu Falah
You say that Abu Saqr makes dinner every day.
This is what I'm seeing.
But, oh, Abu Falah, dinner tonight is a special occasion.
Today, may God protect your son, Falcon.
Mashallah, he deserves it, may you live long, blessed be.
Let the boy of the tribe spread his wings and fly, welcome, my father!
Peace be upon you.
Returned Shenhuo
I'm going to the agency tomorrow with my son Omar to choose the car he wants.
One and a half years and I've been waiting for approval.

And his/her/its belongings
Oh my goodness, you're such a good man, Saad.
Things have turned out badly.
He deserves a resolution.
Imar al-Maarzi chooses the car he likes.
I buy him three
I would like to see
I breathe my life into you.
You didn't tell me you met him at the Kaaba during Hajj.
Today, his son Shahin is young.
He plays his evening toys.
This is your chance.
Pass over him and bless him.
He deserves a long life.
May Shahin, oh Abu Saqr
Please accept my gratitude, everyone.
Thank God for our son Shahin's safety, may he live a long life.
May God protect you.
As from the brother
Long time.
He/She didn't recognize me.
By the beard of God, I surrender to you.
I was with you on the long-lived journey of life.
Even I mentioned that I bought a red lottery ticket.
May God protect you.
I was in the hospital.
My uncle is Azor.
I am honored to meet you.
He's still hesitant to enter the field of commerce and has decided.
I want to go with him, my brother.
Why, Dad, falcon, you know that business is great.
You should never put a desk and an empty space.
Falcon
Long life does not return me and say goodbye.
Returned Shenhuo
A gift of a falcon from me.

And if trade loves you and you have it, you would tell her, "You are not allowed."
Today, you have everything you need – you took the license, praise be to God, and everything has opened up for you: a car for free and a great office on the Corniche.
Yesterday, Abdulaziz said that your father told him if an eagle wants to enter the business, he should do it with me as a 50% partner.
Seriously, how do I choose between business and university?
Ugh, don't force me into anything. I don't like it.
Wow, you, you're being taken care of by agencies and offices and cars, it's like it doesn't matter.
Opportunity, my boy, in this current time, start your trade without capital.
You are the capital of your family, a lover of people.
You're smart, save it.
Believe me, my son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Today is Yawlah, prepare the dinner quickly.

He won't let anything happen to him, he won't let anything happen to him tomorrow either, I'm afraid he'll take the samosa agency.
I think your daughter is opening herself up to business.
This is what you were asking for. You'll know what I'm going to say today.
He tells me, Mom, I want to expand more after investing.
He wants to go to the Caribbean Sea and invest there in the islands.
It is far from the eyes of envy.
Abu Sultan said yesterday that your son is just starting the business.
He has twenty agencies and six restaurants and a nightclub in Bekin.
And I gave him the crooked elbow that he won't return.
It seems, and God knows, that it hasn't been opened yet.
This is what's wrong with the office in the northern part of our office.
I miss you so much.
May God bless you, congratulations, Abbas.
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
It's too late for regret.
Who is Dad, how old are you turning, and what hardship and toil have you endured? Prepare the supermarket.
What's going on? The one who appears every day brings a command to the Mehla.
The secretary told me this harshly. He doesn't have a name, Samir.
He tells me this is Saqr, son of Saqr, who wants to join you as a partner instead of stealing the shop from you.
After your hand with you partner
There is no power nor might except by God.
But after I saw you chatting with him...
Who is Al-Sani?
He hit him with a beetle.
Why are you telling me you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking past that shop, there was a small sign that said "What what is the name?"
Written Bakery Freej
I am, my father's name is not

How's it going with you all?
Congratulations, God willing, tomorrow or after tomorrow we will finish the workers' housing plan for Future Company.
Mr. Lala has become Mrs. Elisa. You know, Mr. Lala is the company’s owner.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take just one of the company’s cars.
Thank you very much, dear.
This is even the cooking that needs science and study.
Today, someone is telling me that I work in the business field and he has a few riyals and wants to invest them.
But this person has no knowledge, no education, and no expertise in economics, nor even in commerce.
Such a person
He thinks it will succeed as he didn't think he would waste his time and he will lose.
I heard, oh Abu Nasser.
I heard those gossips talking on Monday.
The words are good.
You have that, and my son has a falcon, may God bless him.
Mashallah, he/she is wonderful.
Today's offer
May you live long. We are not talking about your son, a falcon.
We are talking about the foundation.
Your child is a falcon, may God bless him, and I’m cold towards him, he’s an exception.
He says, tell me about the rule.
A falcon was born to us, and his son built himself alone.
Kaho gave him a car as a gift once.
Sell it and invest the money, and his advice is the same as him.
Mashallah, ka ka jiftuh.
Hey Abu Sar, we're talking about ordinary people
And one of them did that, and that’s exactly what happened to Abu Nasser. Hassan took his hand and placed it on his chest.
Wow, that eagle has great business talents.
Strong economic leanings
We have to ask who his father is.
I am astonished, by God, I swear.
Wonderful.

May God protect us from harm.
I have no idea what's wrong with you, Salem.
Yes, tell me.
The issue turned out to be real.
He's telling me that the company sent a fax to my father.
They told him it’s over.
pain that does not endure
As you can see
He's telling you, as soon as he heard the news.
He fell on the desk and the fax is in his hand.
And he remained upon it.
He said he taught me archery, and when his arm grew strong, he shot at me.
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salem.
I am stunned.
A piece of advice in this world
A man gives a poor person with his right hand without his left hand knowing.

He is his cousin's son.
Of this kind of days
Good, good cousin’s son.
Will you donate? I'm sleeping, they took me because your brother wants you.
May God will it be a treat.
May God will be good.
Wish I could
Malik ni etsawi ay mashroo’ mithla ya’ni mithla.
Let me know if you need a partner or something else?
I heard someone say that you were planning to, you said you'd come see me, maybe.
Hello, welcome
How do you want to increase the stock?
Praise be to God, the work is excellent.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
I delayed it last week.
God, I swear it.
May God guide you to the best, inshallah. Good night.
He remains.
Are you sure?
And with it, a detailed explanation, and you don't realize the biggest trouble.
Shenei ba'd
It's a shop right next to your shop.
Oh, the envious, oh, the jealous.
Before you knew the market was open to everyone
You need to know.
Your heart really needs to be open to your uncle’s son.
My God, I ask you.
Pretend and attract and make me laugh and do for me.
I want to do my Ketemi work.
You're taking a sticker shop to my place and destroying it on me.
Wa Allah, laakin ma qalu 'ta' ahni aq'ad fi halji sawb zar' al-'aql y yantani
This is envy. This is hatred, and by God, by God, this is hatred. May God guide me away from it.
You guys are good people, man.
Take it easy, old man.
Stay away from him, by God, you're going to come with a kick, man.
Reach for my hand like you reached out, and now you've left me, left my hand.
Oh my guys.
Guys, pray for the Prophet.
I didn't do anything, God willing, God willing.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
No one is imposing anything on you.
Why, why? Why are we Lebanese grapes?
He's telling stories with him, deceiving him and laughing while they enjoy themselves in the end.
I see Bassal, you brought Lebanese milk.
He sat down and persuaded me.
His words charmed me.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand euros.
And two days later, God help you, I'm going to the flea market and I find the cabinet there, twin siblings are selling it for eighteen riyals.
I earned money.
He is a Lebanese designer.
I could meet the mentor yesterday, you said it was difficult to arrange, and it's still difficult.
I swear, today is really hard.
I feel that Abu Saleh has been different these past two days.
What is it?
I don't know what it is about.
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and brought in a Lebanese designer.
I haven't been out in two weeks selling the store's sales.
What's the problem here in Ghtari? Why didn't Ghtari open a shop, and then the same project comes and opens the same shop next to it? Can you enter into it?
La la la, the designer Fadi Hala and I are thinking about a solution.
How is that now?
Sitting in hell, eating poison.
If we consider the shape, I think even renting the shop, we won't enter.
A distant place from them means
Jazi means to occupy the space for them.
Alright, thanks, and how much is the discount?
Seriously, it means that hopefully you don't include with every wedding dress, evening gowns, no
Oh, my people!
What's what, I'm going to the store that you came today from the house, with an announcement for every wedding dress, two evening dresses, no and after a 25% discount.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
No, no, wait for me two weeks until they come back, they're wearing the same dress. Make a wedding dress and get two dresses without a discount of twenty-five percent.
They are always fighting us.
I'm thinking the same way because I hate if they mess up our house.
What's it to you?
It's hard
This is a challenge and I'm grateful for it.
Seriously challenging dude
Seriously, you're really doing the crazy thing, huh? Nobody else could do it but him, trying to earn a living.
Oh, if the news comes to you in two or three days, if you didn't close your shop once.
You're killing me!
Stay away, stay away, sugar sugar, where are you now, where are you, oh God, peace.
The best
Saad says the shop isn't accessible, it doesn't stay in it. The smell is unpleasant. He says he doesn't know where he's going.
The smell has nothing to do with the air conditioner, no.
The scent isn't supposed to leave the store until at least six days.
One hundred percent
Ya fallill
I cut the electric wires from the store.
This is fixed.
Now are you signing the waiver or filing a complaint and opening a case?
Carry on and do something.
End of existence
Oh, Uncle Bounasser, you've become something strange. No one is coming to the shop anymore.
Am Bo Naser, the pharmacist, has a customer who came to me to return a strange story.
Echo and Ali are lying on the bed.
I'm telling you, my nerves are shot. I'm scared to tell him, the bank is calling and they want the installments.
The debts weighed heavily on him, his uncle’s cousin, that wretched man.
What happened this time?
And if they accidentally enter the shop, and the designer, Saeed, sees it, they should shout at him and drive him away.
I need and upon upon it I will add a lock and look at the square.
My mother, what is she doing for me?
Saad is in the shop.
I'm a magician, mother, what should I do?
If I see him with a woman, she will invent a lie and be afraid.
My mother is doing what?
Lost me lost me
My brother, I'm really upset.
I'm afraid they'll arrest me.
And I don't have any documents related to it to go and complain about it.
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
Let him/her/it deserve it.
And tell him to say what magic he did to him, so the designer turned into a monster and the women were afraid when they saw him.
It showed up on the X-ray.
What's happening, guys? Tell him, the photographers need you urgently.
Guys, and may God protect you, tell him you are needed, very needed.
"God, they're raising my blood pressure to the point where I'm going to explode and it's not going to work, Mr. Abdullah."
Malla Ahmed habibi, int a'ad la at'assab gedhi. Int ra'i qalb, ma ma yinfah lak gedhi yabe.
And and Allah, I called him a lot, they tormented me, they exposed me, but but there's no use, these guards will drive me crazy, they will drive me crazy.
You don't use your brain at all, not completely.
The hollow of the reed is in you.
His sweetness five twenty scene sixteenth oh Ahmad let's finish
And then, basically, I have to stop the filming because the actor is...
The result of this
I'm a student, Mr. Abdullah. I'm really worried, why is this happening to me?
My love, do you want anyone to bother you?
Ash'air Abdullah
Late and incompetent actors
Ya Ahmed, ana ma bī ay wahed, habibi.
Give me a hype hype that convinces people that he can really be a millionaire, a billionaire, not just anyone.
Sir, I'm taking a screenshot and will submit it to you within an hour.
Not one guy, Oala, not one guy. I'm still explaining my things to him.
Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the text you want me to translate.
You take responsibility and as production manager, you take responsibility.
Now, they’re scrubbing.
I'm letting everything out, not judging, and accepting whatever happens, but they're just acting.
I want a phone with specific specifications, can you provide one from WhatsApp?
You're telling the truth, you really are.
I didn't hear the director say anything.
I have one, and may God help you all with him, hopefully it will be beneficial.
SS Saud Aknar
Saudi Qwati ana illi akhbiru سعود اكنار
This is a day when I was young, they used to call him Saud Al-Anjar, and when he grew up, they named him Qawati.
Leashes why
I'm telling you why he's poor – he gets picked up in the streets and they catch his feet and sell them by the kilo.
Bro, you're rich and you're not wrong.
It needs to fit perfectly inside its own belly, the one I told him, and it’s not long or awkward.
It's definitely possible.
Inshallah, but I’m telling you, you guys need to apply the makeup perfectly. Will a little bit of blood be okay after?
What's the matter? What are you waiting for? Let's talk.
I don't have the number.
But I'm taking Amir with me and going to him.
Where is Saud Qutbi's house?
What is he saying?
Wait, wait.
Saudi Qwati
We don't have anyone named Saud Al-Qawati in our neighborhood.
Measles, I'm sure it's in the neighborhood, but I forgot the house.
This is a house, one house, named Saud, he and his mother live there.
Yes, correct
But this isn't Saudi Qwati.
This is Saudi's laptop.
Absolutely, it's just developing over time. The laptop is almost a quarter.
He is tall and sturdy, and slightly tan.
Zoom cancelled the oath and began to suppress laptops. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my dear.
Going to the Khardah market to buy them for me and the second one.
God knows, I don't know.
This is what everyone is wearing.
I have another one, my love, where is the second shemagh?
Right to vote
This is what I've been looking for, where is it?
Fex and Bufas
Seriously, finish it properly before your sister-in-law shows up.
But these two days I'm feeling unwell.
Seriously, I miss you so much from last night. I miss you terribly, I miss you terribly. You tell me no.
Hey, they told me I was going to get
Praise be to God, this is it, man! You're finally getting to the work you've been wasting your time on.
Okay, here's the translation: Ya Allah, please, goodbye/take care.
It’s easy to get overwhelmed by her intense, sudden outbursts.
I just sit and sit, moving around, and you have the camera with you, moving your shoes.
Yeah, جعفر, yeah.
This laptop is yours.
A big actor Abdullah Al-Lammah
You have me, I have a son from Fat Abood, what's up?
How are you, O servant?
Just, you know, be respectful, please. Be a little respectful in front of people.
My friend from Farrajina.
Arkad Arkad Arkad Arkad Ahia Ahia
I like to act, God willing, they'll give me the role of a princess.
Honestly, man, it's not like I told you.
I'm so tired, I swear to God, I didn't sleep last night, man.
Asthma, may God heal him.
May God heal her.
I'm falling in spring.
Teacher, teacher
He has asthma, his father's
Not a doctor
May it be upon you, listen what they say, and I swear you have no business here.
What is my mother's name?
May it be upon you, what do you say?
I heard what people say about you.
You say he's light, make him heavier a bit, make him heavier.
Give him, give him, give him, give him, give him, one million repairs for my carrot car.
Give him three million Egyptian pounds for dinner.
Tony, why are you talking like that?
Because I'm heavy with people's requests.
The professor, oblivious, knows that the production of the Frejina film features actors of a high level.
Currently excellent means we're seeing it as suitable for the role.
Sweet and I will help you too, I have nothing, I have nothing, right?
This is your household bill.
I'm falling for Rabea.
The tailor entered and went into the makeup room and did his makeup, and Salman, God willing, will make the suit for you and the shoes for you.
I love it, I love it, I love it. It’s really sweet.
Oh!
Listen up, my brother, leave the car with us until we finish the photoshoot. I'll call you to pick it up.
What's up with you worrying about someone delivering something to me?
It reaches you, I won't leave you, I'll send it to you, thank you, my brother Zain, thank you, thank you, wait.
Oh my god, they called your name, this actor they called him, oh my god.
Guys, call out to Saudi about a laptop in the makeup room
Seriously, how am I supposed to clean this bathroom?
It is written in front of me.
Oh God, I'm going to say
I'm done, you know.
I didn't realize you were thinking of me.
What are we silent about?
We are not silent about our rights
Just wait.
I know from whom I am talking to Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did he leave her? Why
He divorced her and that's it.
We don't take a girl from a thief.
No, what do you think?
When you're done, the most important thing is to just take care of yourself and you'll go into the closet to change your clothes and we're ready for the photoshoot.
Uzroci skupljenja cijene zubi
You're a scene-stopper, your filming is too amateur.
Why is that?
We don't want you here, you've made us sick. My stomach is swollen from waiting. What's happening to us? We've been waiting for an hour, when will we end this waiting?
I miss you so much, after your absence I haven't experienced anything. This is normal.
Thank you very much.
Fast, Mashallah
May God protect you, my long-lived one.
A gathering of people
They say that Abu al-Aziz will greet you.
Inshallah, may you live long, Inshallah.
Beautiful girl
May you be blessed, May you be pleased with you, Do you love your nose?
It's the first time someone has loved me for my nose.
How do they love them with their noses?
Problems
He received his composure like an Eskimo whip, cracking your beautiful, beautiful palms.
I swear, after you didn't laugh.
Take it easy on me.
Fix the actor
May God keep you safe, your voice is beautiful.
Ugh, I'm so tired, I was waiting for you.
Come quickly
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
Come here, man, or go your own way.
Listen to me
Yeah, let's go.
I feel like the respect is increasing.
Dude, man.
And peace be upon you. What is it, my long-lived one?
Shuha shuuha shuuha shuuha
Don't worry, Inshallah, you will be, Dr. Hassan. Come, come.
Yeah, Doctor Hani, what's up?
Rest well at the office, my friend.
I haven’t seen it.
Everyone, God willing, you will be safe.
Please, please, long life, please.
Shut up, you stupid box on your face.
I am Ahmed, my name is Bouabdelaziz.
Don't call me, my uncle.
How are you, Uncle?
God damn this phone
Yes, indeed.
Please, Master, have a seat and rest.
May God bless you.
With the chef
Take him with you, Mr. Rushad.
By God, what was done for you has reached me and I will show it to you.
Hey, is it possible to get a doctor quickly?
My mother is sick.
Wait your turn, your turn.
Listen to me
Could you be my friend?
Oh my god, I'm so tired.
I go to the hospital so many times every week to take my mother. I haven't seen a single one of them. They always seem so busy.
Like local girls
Leave the country girls alone.
Seriously, dude, look for a woman at the hospital.
Cheerful
Seriously, why aren't you giving me a face?
Seriously, don't approach her, laugh at her, give her your number and tell her you're a good person.
There’s nothing.
Take care of yourself.
I don’t understand what you’re saying.
Lala ma bi ma bi shi
The water shouldn't leak.
I wish
Bye, thank you.
You could take it and go.
The person who talks to you is Khaled Al-Marzouzi.
I would marry them.
I love you, Dad. You have the robe, and you have the clothes, and you have the car after you fix it for me.
Please provide the co
Lala luh-zah
Oh Allah
What the hell is Falah the idiot saying?
Welcome, welcome, greetings! Who is this? Welcome.
This past gathering was in my sight.
Oh, I wish you would come.
I'm telling you, they were amazed by what I did for them. It was a really elegant and special party.
One normal and the other diet.
Malaj doesn't have an excuse now.
What's up?
Hey, I have a meeting at quarter past tomorrow at work.
Inshallah, you're going to take this for them.
It's safe
Nour Tala
What is this?
He's going to do this thing that's his friend's shame.
The video is making everyone talk about us.
Give me the money and tomorrow I'll go buy you something fancy.
I'm dating them right now.
I need to go tomorrow.
I don't have to open my people's accounts right now to go somewhere and get something that I want to show to people in front of them.
How are you all?
Its price is suitable and its type is very good.
Above average means not the highest type.
Even though it’s for sophisticated chocolatiers only, I thought maybe you’re looking for a suitable price.
After this expensive dress made me fall in love, after those beautiful words for the dearest one.
It's impossible to check this artistic touch.
Haidi Asma Chocolate Royal
The same chocolate that the Royal Palace in Spain always orders.
Give me this.
Congratulations and on this occasion, a warranty certificate as well.
Please, please, rejoice.
Come on, bro, give us some of that chocolate, bro.
I'm asking what the occasion is, O leopard.
Saleh Abdulqader is not good at accounts.
Blessed, he deserves it, come after give me alone come.
We injected ourselves with the coffee as fast as we could.
My aunt went to their wedding.
My love, I went to their wedding, it was a disaster, it made me sick, do you believe it, my sister
I heard what your aunt said.
That’s why I want to do a wedding for you, whether it happens or not.
I don't have anything left except a month and a half.
I am organizing everything.
But honestly, he's making me
You don't live in society, people who hold their weddings put their dowry and valuables.
I saw your soul.
When I bought you something nice, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
What did they tell you about its splendor and sweetness?
Just how many installments did we pay?
The money we paid for the Imam is going to bring four goats for the wedding.
And if you don't interfere, your mother won't get to know anything. You just have to give her the money and that's it.
That means they agree with anything we choose.
You have no taste, honestly.
What do you think about hakusho?
But discrimination costs more money.
Why, why is the beautiful one gone?
What do you think about Bedhi?
It's the first time in Qatar's history that someone is thinking of building a wedding stall shaped like a computer luxury car.
Excuse me, please.
Look, you're talking about everything except the couch and the equipment. This is the place where the ladies who don't have anything else than the husband are sitting. Just be quiet.
The rial is waiting for us.
We want this luxury counter.
Strange couch
One-Six-Five Model from 2011
We took the luxury option.
Relax, all of this for your own good.
The important thing is to choose whether the Ark would add twenty thousand more, or if luxury would add fifty-five thousand.
Let’s go and we are ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
We think you're imagining getting married in the Comoros Islands, that's a very basic electrical wire.
And we're just starting out too, you know.
If you don't want a wedding, where will the bride sit in the bridal chamber?
Steel and paint and some wood.
People are happy.
They take advantage of us and deceive us with these scammers, they are scammers anyway.
What are you saying now?
Upset and angry
I don't want to get married anymore.
I speak to the bride’s mother and tell her that his fiancé has difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married, he can't afford the wedding expenses. It's fine, you can talk to her. It's just how I am, I talk to her.
Today we received a shipment and flowers from Holland.
I think if I put them on the tables at the wedding
Definitely for the first time in Doha
And the Middle East after
Put it on the invoice
It means "the number increased."
Ammihin ithnain wa sab'een ay khalas
But Samir doesn't want to see this collection at the wedding of weddings.
He became known after the rumors.
Consider them booked.
You love me more than I do.
A door opens for you, one you don’t know how to close.
May God help you, Saleh.
But seriously, you're amazing, man. I tried to sort things out a bit.
But thank God, I am determined to go and see my wife from any Arab country.
They're saying there's a wedding there, and it won't cost you anything, like a thousand two hundred dollars, and you just jump in.
God bless you, my love.
Inshallah, next year he/she is getting married.
Just specify a few cards and tell me.
Don’t worry, the invitations are ready. The important thing is that people know they’ve been invited, where and what time.
This is all that matters, not what people say. What's wrong with you?
They are deceiving people by knowing the wedding level and the cards.
Tomorrow, when Jafou's credit cards are out, people will know what they're saying.
Slap them at their wedding, since those are their cards, they didn't see the cards of Afwan Afwan.
We didn't say that, we're ordering it online.
Her cover is made of polar bear fabric and it has a dark blue button.
Don't worry, but I don't need anything from you.
I don’t become a card for your beautiful women, we order them, meaning we order them.
By God, you're breaking my heart, my brother.
Poor, definitely he's crushing him.
Man, no one stopped him from borrowing from him.
What are you saying, he even sold his car?
His face grew twenty years old in the morning. He looked at it, walking and talking to himself.
I'm not blaming him, brother, he's poor, I swear. I don't know when we're getting better.
Sugar, don't worry about it.
Forgiveness, my friend.
You didn't even try to convince them that you could throw a decent wedding.
He meant it to me.
Why am I living with my head cut off?
The problem is that our sick society is obsessed with appearances, boasting, and showmanship.
It's imposing on you that you are sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there
I once saw the mother-in-law of the bride.
I just want my food.
Let's leave it to God.
I said
How did you get married?
And I don't want to marry a minority.
And then, my friend, even if I decide to marry
I'm thinking of getting a foreign one or even an Arabic one.
I swear, your country is crazy, they tell me
"And Allah, we were planning to be the DJ for the songs."
But as long as Aunt Naser is arranging her son's wedding, that singer
This singer is famous, but people have forgotten his name.
What is the substance?
I don't like what I'm doing.
Enough with his car and every day one of his friends picks him up.
I went into the room to find him talking to himself.
I see your words have changed now.
Because my brother Saleh, I'm so tired, you know.
I have nothing to do with you, nor with your affairs.
I'm no less than people.
Don't leave our hospital.
And he sends his greetings to you, my love, but his brother spent all he had and didn't let anyone not borrow from him.
And may God keep your silence, you are only silent.
My mother has new requests for the wedding, and my brother said he's canceling the wedding altogether. I won’t marry anymore.
Now, uh huh, where?
Inside is a rescue ambulance
He says it's sweetest now, but they're preparing a room for her in the hospital.
Our shameful pair
Take care of yourself, my dear sister.
Dr. Qalq said, "Don't speak and I'm giving you an injection so you won't be admitted to the hospital."
Where to relax and unwind, making it a haven for those who deserve it and those who don't.
Dude, I'm telling him to bring us Abdullah, and he says he doesn't have money.
And so he is obligated to your mother.
I feared for her.
She has a spirit, she has a spirit, and kiss her on the head.
And tell her to do whatever you want her to do.
I’m sending Abdullah Al-Awisha a message.
Boyoussef, okay, I don't think he'll fail with me.
Don't tell me what I found except for Bouyoussef.
How are you, sis?
Hey Saleh
But the Minister is a well-behaved man, because he's an old man and above all that, he's organized and trustworthy.
I want your opinion, seriously. If you went and told him the words you told me, there's a big chance his heart would stop.
I understand.
Because of the shitty situation you're in, you want to order money from Boyoussef, of course, from the ministry's money.
God only knows when you'll return them to him.
Hey, if they don't come with the auditing team, ask them about the money.
He might disappear like that, of course.
Who knows later is able to deal with it.
And how are you, the money is in the office while you carry the responsibility if something happens there.
My last life I was stealing.
My uncle, what is his name? It's embezzlement.
On the first floor
In a square box with a blue tape and a circle with something like a picture of a goose, goose.
Inshallah, my uncle, my uncle, my boy Yusuf, I, I, if they don't show up, it will be difficult.
I'm back, completely whole.
Isamoni Boyoussef
You are the last of my life.
Destroy me, Thursday.
Sali Sali
Hasan, listen to what I'm saying, and God willing, if one other like you came, you would write it down, otherwise something will happen to you, ya ya ya, Khaled.
Sali Sali
All the ways I've tried without any use, my uncle Booyesouf, I'm drowning already.
I can’t change my RSVP now for the wedding.
And I know all of them are bald.
How are you? How are you?
Lala tilted the wonders, the wonders second.
On the stairs, on the stairs
My cousin Bouyoussef El-Darj, he's a fan of one of those candies, a single piece.
Hello, the Caucasian guy with that picture of a dude
We booked two rooms for us, one for makeup and one for hair.
And tomorrow morning we will be there.
Yabna Abdullah Arwished and his band
Baby, I see you.
I didn't tell her.

We are the first people in the world to have our data queried.
Mommy, mommy
May God guide you. / May God be with you.
There is no god but God.
Hey, don't forget tomorrow if you enter the hall, recite the Mu'awwidhat.
The women, their eyes were hot.
I told you about the magnificence.
Best groom, Mashallah you are beautiful, my love.
Hey hey, the police are kicking down the door.
I’m wrong for helping you, God help me.
My wedding is forbidden today.

Boyusef Boyusef Boyusef
To the people
Seriously, it's awful if this happens.
The company presented a contract with three million, two million of them only, regarding the value of the materials.
Minister's memoirs were written.
We said in corruption but we didn't reach a point where it became so severe.
You're not living in this world.
He, the Minister, said about Osman.
Our manager didn't even need to say anything, he just knew.
I have no idea about him, God knows I have no idea.
Where are ethics?
The wrong became right and the right became wrong.
Oh, my goodness, are you sure the Minister Fanusha? What's going on in the world?
Finshe and that's it.
What next?
The minister’s property
This girl is seeing the minister.
Oh, world!
What is this? You didn't know it?
This new employee that the minister appointed in place of the poor Osman.
Amsh amsh amsh
You broke me, making me do this, Saleh. I'm exposing the minister.
Who are you?
Listen to me, man.
We have sons, we want to live.
I want us to live
What happened?
A poor man is standing by the turn.
May finality be with sincerity and integrity, O my friend, Saleh.
Jan Zain, we can do something for you, my brother.
Praise be to God. Praise be to God for everything.
How are you, Saleh?
Some of the weird things we find in this world
This is unbelievable stuff, I can't even believe it.
My order
My dad needs to go to the supermarket and get us some bottled water while you're leaving work.
I’m trying, God willing, goodbye.
Who will take my sister home?
And the rule is, after laughing and chatting, who is it?
This is my classmate and I at university. I don't mind if she comes over, you know?
Wow wow wow, how did you change? You're not like the first one.
What do you guys say?
What are you hearing us saying?
Your thinking is outdated.
True and false after there is new and old
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved, we are living in the age of technology.
The age of global variables, a world coalescing and none able to pursue it.
We lived and perished.
I won't blame Amina, you can't force someone if they're frustrated and agitated.
Who sees this in his day?
Tell her I apologize.
Religion isn't going the right way anymore.
Don't bother yourself, come and have lunch.
Let me go sleep and rest.
Dad, I'm not upset about you.
Dad, there's no salt.
No, there’s nothing to be upset about. Get up and wash the dishes and eat lunch.
Oh my love
I'm definitely very eager to meet you all on my first day of work.
The honor is ours, may you live long.
sure, sure
Of course I'm aware that you don't need to remind me about the work's basics.
But at the same time, it is very important.
We retrieve with some values and principles that have been poured out.
For the public good
You should live long.
We all need to.
I really need it, you know.
You are thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
And what I want to say after that
Beware of you on my first day of work.
There is one employee between you.
loyal and dedicated and stuff like that
Just a doubt.
There is a librarian.
In order for us to be able to take the necessary legal measures in our ministry.
You old man.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
I wish you well, my colleagues, both in front of and behind me, I say
Where is Khaled?
Yes, indeed.
Khaled, you've been praised a lot, Mashallah, you're amazing.
Inshallah, may you live long.
By God, you've chosen well, O long-lived.
May God guide you, truly.
Why are you letting the devil slander you?
Say الحمدلله that came to honesty
Hey, why is my dad in prison?
Shut up, Mom.
Good night.
Hey, why is my dad in prison?
My woman's head
It means Amin has become.
It's annoying when you say about Abu Amin
This is confusing.
Every part of you is covered.
Shijie Feng Yuan
Inshallah, I’m going to look for a job that will occupy you like this.
A respectable woman covered her body and was alluring.
She suffocated my chest after I told her I was wearing a bra.
I want to be with her at your place.
Wow, she's got it all. And those pants that reveal half her belly from above.
But it's useless, it doesn't listen to the words, it doesn't want to go the just path.
I'm telling you.
I won't blame but your eyes.
We are demanding your daughter Sarah, the son of our husband Rashid.
One of us built his daughter’s shed today with the honest money.
Warshd Al-Obshrikh
This is a trick. It's not a real word.
The hero is slower from his room.
Always drunk, 24 hours a day.
سكران وتيت وطول اليوم امنشم
Stubbornness is not inquired about.
And good upbringing, O Abu Rashid.
And warn against a hypocrite after him.
How is the trumpet?
Genuine, my son, and what about drugs? How?
If I find its black spot matching its eye color beforehand, I’ll give you five riyals.
Hey, Abu Sarah, we're not going to marry her.
This phrase is
Girl of origin
Blessed be you, my son. Blessed be this year. Blessed.
I am drunk.
I couldn't walk.
Yo, let's go, man.
Bye bye
Dude, come on, come on, call your dad so he can come and pick you up.
Call him to...
Yeah, just yeah, whoever takes you.
Where are you?
There is a young man lying in the stomach, and he has a beautiful blonde girl.
Yeah, if your dad gives it, it's okay.
Hello my dear, my beautiful Mary
Majid was not named Abdulaziz.
Oh justice
My daughter is bothering me.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine and its capital Jenin in 2003, following the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and a siege against it.
Their latest claims against Palestinians, fueled by Israelis and their Arab friends.
They are smuggling plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially item number two, paragraph one, which states that the Palestinian people must clip their fingernails every day.
We are now moving you to the fateful meeting.
My dear
When Israel agreed for the State of Israel
Man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation. What's your problem and just leave it at that.
Please
Sorry Mr. Leopard Sorry Mr. President
Let me speak.
We fully comply with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this representative of Israel saying?
Do you have any solid stone or plastic here, as we're committed to it
Even our homes, man.
What do you guys call it in the Gulf?
All over Palestine, it's made of wood.
American companies, according to an agreement, will build us wooden cars.
And the doors of our houses are all made of thermally treated wood, you know.
We don't want speeches
Do not change the topic.
Mr. President
This is an important point. Please vote on this matter because nail care is a violation of the agreement.
The worshiper raises his hand.
But I had a strange dream.
To control the students
I want and I'm telling him.
This is the fourth school I’ll be attending tomorrow.
Because I’ve abandoned my strong persona as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are chasing him and pulling at his clothes and he is silent.
I’ve been crying so much without a beard.
My boss told me.
Rashid is good, we don't want to complicate things.
The kids are drawing on the wall with markers.
Aaron’s foreskin was in the public eye before the whole world.
They said this is a personality-deficient teacher who is ruining us all.
I'm telling you about the incident with the writer.
Maryam 'Ad
And after that conversation about the writer, this is new, someone told me.
He threw a pen on the chair to write a complete sentence.
And he sat
What do I know about the matter?
Just a dry day, the kids are laughing at him in the schoolyard.
But it's okay
Tell your supervisor who is on duty tomorrow to call me.
But let's give him a chance anyway.
Because I want to tell you
The time of goodness and weakness is over.
Hey son, your uncle Abdullah.
I will find Rashid different
What makes you remember the important educational quote
You are a teacher's graduate and I am a teacher's graduate.
We all remember the saying.
The teacher is the first-grade student.
I will look for Professor Rashid Al-Qawi.
And I might make a mistake.
Oh, woe!
First, I said to you, "Be quiet, good boy."
Brewing dishes he said
Who among you is making fun and saying "shut up" nicely?
You killed me, shut up properly.
Me too
Damn, those shoes you're wearing.
The spirit of the manager is rising.
And he, Professor Rashid, expelled me.
I don't want to see a stain on your face here, I'm listening.
Please in your frustration
It shouldn't be like this just on the first day of the year all year long.
Oh, woe!
Whoever hears his voice
I explain or I speak.
Do you know what it means?
Nervous, do you know what nervous is?
It means nervous.
Did you hear me? Are you okay?
I have heard it.
Let me offer you a solution.
Spirit of the director
Oh Lord, take your spears and go out.
Take up your shields
Okay, her
I'm still turning it over in my mind.
Sir, they didn't see him.
I want ice cream with milk if it has strawberries and it's really sweet.
My love, عبدالrahman
Everyone is prone to error, and Adam is a human.
God has covered him with disgrace.
It just means the most important thing is the topic, it shouldn't reach the father.
I want the chocolate that's in my bag.
Hazar wa shinn wa nattak shinn wa yantak waween shantak
In the classroom
My eyes
You're saying you're happy for me.
You can't tell the difference between a boy from a good family and a regular boy.
How does the saddle look? The saddle is terrifyingly red.
Come on, where are you going?
In the bathroom
And you are waiting in the bathroom.
Knock on the door as quickly as possible and say, "The first class starts in half an hour, let's hurry!"
I am like all of them before, one juice and one gypsum.
They took all their pendants to his wife, عبدالrahman's wife. This is really good for health.
Okay, now go to Saudi's place and get a PlayStation Plus card from him.
If what do we learn from this story
The human being
He must possess noble morals.
This is the PlayStation controller and he told me to return the whole PlayStation once I get back to me.
Inshallah, Tamir will tell me something after my friend عبدالrahman my friend.
Now, I'm busy.
We learn from the story
Of course you guys know that I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into graduate studies.
I said I need to submit the event file before I travel.
Abd al-Rahman told me he wanted to take her in the afternoon, but he doesn't know where he wants to go, and he didn't specify what time.
She just got back from traveling and didn't say anything. Thank God, I thought I was recovered.
Suppose you gave him today in the afternoon and he got upset and his father didn't say "I love you, I love you, no, no."
Hello, my friend عبدالrahman
May God help you.
What are we doing?
So sweet, so sweet
El wa ma ya oulad bina khuz درس جديد ف العلوم
Peace be upon you.
Thank you, thank you
Dad, what's up
I didn't ask, I didn't ask from my eyes.
Teacher, teacher, how do you ask the teacher for five?
In a store, a man is walking to get water for a student. Your bed is for lalala. This problem won't end well. I'll write it in the report.
It's raining and drizzling.
Don't raise your voice and don't argue with the listener, or else...
How much is this, how much does it do?
How much is this car?
four cars five
Excellent, this is excellent, very good, excellent.
Sh wayh hadi
Just like you're doing a car stunt in front of my house and it's on our account.
Don't tell me about the days of Bounasser
Bonasser finished.
He is studying bear.
Zain broke the table.
About anxiety
What does it mean?
Upon your head, feathers.
Adjust your style with me.
I and you
We didn't say anything, man.
What's up?
Listen, things are going, it's much better for you.
I don't understand.
What's the need? And I want you to rest.
What are you saying?
Instead, I don't know, you know?
You look like you want to...
I'm fine, how are you, that's it.
Fastest fastest
Ha ha, that's good.
It's up to how it goes, it won't happen.
Freij Abuha
We're going to Uncle Bonai's place to settle a dispute and to talk.
Who is Rashid acting in the neighborhood as he pleases
You made me speak.
Come on guys, let's listen to what Uncle Bonayev is saying.
Now this nonsense that doesn't amount to anything is messing with your nerves.
Stay away
If I didn't give him a punch, I stuck him under the umbrella.
The game is played with its own rules.
Zayyini
Goodbye.
You still haven't seen anything.
You know he has a jewelry store.
I saw a girl wearing rings and necklaces.
God has been merciful upon us.
Just keep going after you’re done in the heat.
I didn't believe Rashid, who was always scheming and had nothing to offer, ended up like this.
The general manager’s deputy placed it.
He says he tells you, you are a teacher and he is a teacher, but in his heart where is he? And where have you become?
Take it easy on me.
Take it easy, Abdullah.
I'm teaching you what the secret is.
The professor arrived the professor arrived
Teacher, I didn't do anything.
Teacher, what do you know about this boy?
My love, I know this is a boy from
I'm just telling you that this is a really great opportunity like this one.
I'm looking for a job, I swear I laughed, I really laughed.
It doesn't matter, the job is in the bag.
Thank you and thanks for your help.
Peace be upon him.
My mother greeted you after God, and she prays that she will deliver the news to you and to Ali.
Okay, here's the translation: Bye, God be with you, my love. May God protect you.
After you finish school, your brother and I become ministers, but if you believe it, then, father
Come on, Mom, let's work, let's work on something heavy.
But my dad if your job doesn't say anything.
That's why they gave it to you.
It's just something normal, you know.
Okay, here's the translation: Okay, automatically, this is what you want to say.
Hey, my love, please fulfill my dream.
Before your dream, my dream was
Build me a tower between the Corniche towers.

Thank you, thank you, thank you
Hey Abu Saleh
I'm saying my friend looks upset.
I swear, you can't tell he's [of a certain age/status/etc.], you know?
You’re a good one, you old man, Saleh.
Give him a prayer, and he'll get his phone back and a blessing.
Check this out, these are moves, and for sure, Boasultan is a million in terms of skill, and he's on top of him.
He wasn't really close with Boussalh.
No, Sultan, why are you doing this if you’re planning something?
Seriously? That's unbelievable.
The car door stopped closing.
It's ending, it works, it stops, the minister's car appears.
Oh my god, please don't hurt my heart, please don't hurt my heart.
For your information, the story you hear in the coffee shops is becoming a reality in the country.
But I don't believe what I'm hearing.
My heart is standing, my heart is standing
I'm afraid this matter will fall on the beautiful women, or on my plate, my love. It reminded me of the women.
Say something, you Bassultan, I'm shocked in the daytime.
Please, I know what I'm going to do.
Limited to you.
Amena, I'm just working on something quietly.
I opened that door for him. This is the beginning of the plan I have in mind.
I would rather be the minister than anything.
Let me work, I have a plan.
Let them take it off.
Which plan
But he has to trust me at first.
They told me his eyes are those of a minister, because he was appointed two months before you.
Because I’m holding his collar and hitting him.
Magic can be canceled.
Shenei thi
Shneihi has dimensions.
Every activity that photographers prohibit is a photographic style that burns in the newspaper.
And the scent rises until it surfaces.
sure, of course
You be patient, let me work on it and I'll tell you.
Long-lasting
Of course, the Minister is happy.
Then come back and tell me.
Thank you for the lamb, it’s delicious meat.
The pound is at the door, go to him.
I won't act like people want you, and you want to diminish yourself.
The Minister, please, please.
I can't imagine the minister's efforts at all.
I’ll give it to you second by second.
I swear by my brother, your plan really impressed me.
I want you to take it and make it look good.

They all love you, but you don't seem to know what's wrong.

They're envious of you, don't throw stones at the fruitful tree.

I'm so tired, seriously exhausted, for a whole month and now I'm looking for...
Let me relax today
Hello, Ms. Sultan.
I'm saying
Oh, you, but where is it reaching me?
I'm seeing you improve.
You saw the famous Ibn Nafsaj doing that.
Praise be to God, thank you that you convinced me.
It appears, frankly.
This minister of yours is a hapless, past-mistress, and his faults pleased him.
My brother Saad threw it at me.
No way, I didn't follow any activities today and I didn't read the newspapers, I have no idea.
Let's go! Goodbye.
God is with me, returning the ant’s disappearance to her—she has no wings.
Hello brother, do you have a room at the hotel tonight for a conference?
Wedding
Like, it means there's nothing like that, no activity, like a birthday party or a wedding.
I don't know, but maybe you can see the hotel behind us.
There is a hotel called Warham.
Don't leave you in the car and I'll go to the hotel. Ask.
Go on, go on, go on. Farewell. Go.
Everyone hopes so, God willing.
Let's have this minister rest and relax.
It means I didn't find a party for it, or a wedding, or any event where it could have happened.
Eighteen hotels, and he didn’t find a single registered address like hers.
Silence, but hello.
I didn't find him a birthday.
One can catch the second half.
Every number has a hundred pictures.
I don't sleep, we don't sleep, man.
Hey man, you're a crazy fool, you've taken the first picture and then smashed the pot.
She says her daughters are participating in a competition two days before a photo of the Minister of Religion.
One person is asking another, "Today, they put a bunch of photos of the minister in the newspaper."
Whoever gets awarded the prize
The basic thing is that you come get coffee and listen to the comments every day about the photos in the newspaper. He never stops, man.
God is about to abolish it.
As they say, the butterfly until God wills its end is near the light.
People are praising you and greeting you.
He has become one of the most famous people in the country.
May God reward you, and who is this?
Ruined my prestige
May God protect you and her.
She says we all got married, except for poor Amel, the only one of us who didn't get married.
This is my fate.
It wasn't written for me to advertise.
I've already forgotten about the wedding matter.
May God be my judge against those who caused this.
I'm looking for these sellers who are over there.
What's wrong?
I'm looking for someone who plays with my hair.
These boys or girls?
After my father died... and I mean, I almost killed him.
It's a big job, really.
Don't dye it, it's a shame for a servant girl.
Oh my God, make me a cup of coffee.
I want to talk to my mother, but I don't just have one maid for her, I have two.
We told my mother once, Malaj, what do you have, Khulood? This is my son, he's not your son, you're not his mother.
What else do you have to say besides Khulud and the housemaids?
Girl, that's really good, it's eternal 24 hours with the maid and that's all it needs.
Oh God, get out, let me rest. I want to sleep. How am I?
Biyi Saud Khulud, your brother has become a boy.
Wait a while, if I don't know about my father.
I'm telling you, Khulood, heal yourself, Khulood.
Saleh says that Khulood is putting on makeup and going to heaven. Girls, what's going on? What's going on?
Hey hey hey, you Saudi!
I put makeup on her face, expensive makeup from local artists. She saw the makeup bottle and played with it.
I saw Antifa and this big group, and it didn't seem like anything.
Nice and lovely and tender.
I am Saudi Nawal
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Well, back then you asked me, "What's happening?" and you didn't answer me, now answer me, "What's happening?"
You're my eternity, my love, Saad, you're going to be a soldier, you've gone wild.
We go to London the same year.
Oh, the trembling word in Bahrain.
He let him come, Susan and Fahood and Khouloud.
Peace be upon his seal.
I seek forgiveness from Allah the Greatest.
Today my dad told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you a place by the sea, or a place where our shoes?
He told me I don't need to choose.
I love you, I live with you in any place.
Thanks, sweetheart.
And teach me to catch fish
Oh God, my hope, it dims and opens, and they tell me my university is finished.
JPG - Men's Perfume
My mom just smells really weird.
What's up?
The way you speak has become feminine.
You forgot that you're a man.
Inshallah, after this I will talk to people outside.
I can't believe it, Khaled.
Please leave my room.
Alas, what a loss, what eternity.
I fell out of my eye.
Oh my God, please don't hurt my feelings, you know I'll tell my mom.
This is my son and I know him well.
And upon you, O Khulud, O my eye’s gaze, O may all the children be quenched and his feelings extinguished.
You know, I hope I don't find one gentle and calm, I told my daughters about him.
Seriously, seriously, are you saying you're talking about your brother about this?
Seriously, you've just made it bigger and bigger, it was small.
What did he put on him, a little scent that smells good right now? What’s the difference between men’s and women’s perfumes?
I say you and you are saying this matter in front of your father.
I have
Just be quiet, just quietly, so that Muhammad doesn't feel anything.
Oh, where are these girls meeting?
"By God, it's shameful to do this. That girl is beautiful."
I don't read him/her. I don't read him/her.
Wa Allah, I'm afraid of feeling like something concerns me.
Give yourselves some rest.
I know you guys are seeing all these widespread Bluetooth issues these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, but let him come.
Congratulations, Saad
May God keep you.
I'm telling you, we're still waiting for you. We haven't played cards yet.
Why?
They're drinking something.
I found him sleeping here with you in the apartment. It's been two days now.
About the Bluetooth issue
Which brothers are cursing about it?
Afraid of him
I'm not trying to fight anymore, don't try.
I seek refuge in Satan, my mother, for your sake.
I have already booked it.
I'm done, and where do I go with all these people who owe me?
What is your father saying?
Tell him anything.
They're all just kids, they're all just kids, they're all just kids.
This is the end, seriously.
Tell me when Khloud was little.
You would definitely get this result.
Oh my goodness, but get up and go outside!
True words always hurt.
The jar broke.
I can't live in Doha.

I've been glued to my phone for a while now.
Wait for me, my love
This and you, daughters, wake all day in the heat.
Magnolia, and I'm a guy whose whole day is spent meeting people outside.
It's hard, my hope.
I couldn’t live through a whole day of my life, with my head on the ground.
My dad has been sensing something is wrong and that there's a change happening at home for a while now.
When my father passed away, he was absent from the events that happened at home.
My dad sometimes praises me and sometimes criticizes me.
My dear Amal, when I remember his flaws and his dedication to his work in order for us to live with dignity among people.
I am
When he left the responsibility of the house and the children on his wife
We don't want to dig up the past.
My father and the neighbor knew each other.
But I intend to.
Send him the Bluetooth.
But I'm not going to give it to him.
I don't want to see my dad's accident in my eyes.
It hurts a lot.
No matter what, my hope.
Know us
Better than what they tell me.
What a loss, my house has deteriorated to that extent.
Because a bomb was detonated in it called Khulud.
Customs and traditions
Mocking them with such disrespect
They were preoccupied with their affairs.
And what they hear in splendor
Just one voice
It is the sound of filth and perversion.
Widonson is all good.
What came to your mind?
Suddenly, I decided to travel for studying.
We can only say God bless you, my son.
God bless you.
The gifts, the ones that come back from traveling, not the ones we send out traveling.
You are correct.
This is the base.
But every rule
Come quickly, nation, come with me!
Hey, it's dry.
I didn't hear it.

How are you?
Ugh, what's up, babe?
Damn it.

You'll sell and sell, a thousand and two hundred thousand dollars, God willing, a lot of money.

You've been sick for seven months, but I'm still hurting in my belly. Oh God, take me home.

You're the first time I'm here, I'm just coming to give money, you.
Seven hundred gives
You are a new new you. You are six months old. This is 800.
I want money.
This driver, you're saying old, old words? You're new.
This is seven hundred and eighty-two.

This just says that if you come, I'll give you 100 riyals.
Three hundred nothing is useless.
I speak your words well.

But how do you think about letting him?
Go wherever you find it
It seems like
I'd rather pay for my ticket and travel than just sit here waiting for the money.
My inner void, I wish I could just build it.
Come inside, friend, when there isn't anyone buying now.
At the beginning of the game, you guys were looking scared and I was noticing you a lot.
We're afraid of what, we're afraid our team won't score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You seemed scared and nervous before the game, like you were intimidated by the opposing team.
I'm not scared of the opposing team, I'm scared of our team. I'm afraid that they won't score and I'll say more than three.
This is the level of our team, I know it. I'm talking about the level of our team.
I trust you more than myself.
Half the opposing team has nothing.
Foxes are good, Abu said, "How did you advance towards the first goal?"
Where are you going?

Come, I want to go with you, I want to pick you up.
Thank you, friend.
What are you guys trying to prevent our team from achieving?

He's saying there are a lot of problems.

Hello, good evening, I'm going to the mosque, please.
Hey man, what's up?
Please, be kind.

Our esteemed viewers are with us a fan of the most famous team, the Foxes, also known as Thulob.
But they say that you beat them because they are lacking.
This is in the speech of this in the speech, there is nothing good.

This is inside a satellite at high.
This is the fair fan.
Hey my brother
I received him with enthusiasm.
Please, you lovely one.
Where is the Indian boy who is kicking the ball?
I haven't seen him in a long time.
Oh man, this is a big problem, he's not up to it here.
I saw someone from a few days ago and I didn't recognize him. He was counting at a Kawi Shop, like, at Flagio, named Star Bix Bix. He was doing that.
I remember that friendship used to come with us to the café; he wasn't with a big cup of tea.
He gave his son twenty riyals as a gift.
This way of doing it like this
Man, he's having trouble with the big officials at the club, they're dealing with him, he's not getting along with them.
I say a fox.
My mother's name
My mom says, "Do it for me, do it for me."
You don't have anything to argue about supporting Hayes and you're exhausted like this club.
This is a team of financial foxes with a financial heart, I am.
You are wasting your time, stopping a heart that has no life.
Quality inside a bag three
You’ve never heard that poem that was written in the court.
Yesterday was our game against them.
Please, please, little fox, say it, say it, this is a poem, say it, say it.
My mom is praying in a secret world that I don't know.
This is my money, I have a lot.
I have no night at all, where am I?
You know that we are a fan association for the Foxes club
It means you can't tell me the name of the lawyer so I can officially register as a journalist.
We have a press conference and hopefully we will announce the winner there.
Say what is beautiful
And the famous fan of this disease who was honored today by the administration of the Foxes Club in a noble gesture and a very beautiful response.
I swear by God.
A fox with a thousand congratulations on this beautiful honor and a wonderful gift, for sure.
He says you have this in a pen or a shirt.
I swear, he's going crazy.
This is a gesture of goodwill.
I'm telling you it is.
I must inform the police.
Sit down.
Fans all these things in mall fans
Good night, Papa. You are alone, aren't you?
I'm telling you it is.
You're late.
I don't know when the matches are or anything, man.
Okay, so how are we going to fish?
We're just waiting for the Foxes to play the next match.
aku aku jafte
Catch him
Man, you're late.
Acoustic acoustic acoustic acoustic
He deserves it, he deserves it, he deserves it, he deserves it.
The thing is that we're not sure if this now is "ah-hoo" or "uh-hoo."
I'm telling you, he is, my brother, he is.
I'm saying my opinion and wisdom is that we go to those two and ask them, "Where is this driole you have? Where does it come from? How does it come? When does it come?"
Seriously, you have to make such a long trip?
I'm going to tell him. I'm sure he is.
And may God preserve you, bless your generosity, and keep you well.
Registered in my name, named after me, named
This wind is in the second place next to his house.
Say, your father is safe, the son of Abdul Rehman the Beggar has arrived. No safety, no safety, no safety.
Lord have mercy. You're alright. It seems we're mistaken, my friend. We're here for one of your friend's brothers and we suspected you of something.
Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala created the heavens and the earth and guided therewith people to the path of their Lord.
Thank you, thank you very much, may you live long, thank you.
Please forgive me, may God protect you. Thank you, thank you.
Ya Allah, open our chests for Your grace. I am not yours, open my chest. What is your safety, O God? What is your safety, glory to God.
And what do you say after? Are you sure?
Let's see, what can we do now? God willing, our father.
What's up, Waleed?
And I and I am walking the bag is empty
Ya Allah, fajj al-han 'aad
Get out of your room, get out.
Please be well, God willing.
May God protect us.
Come on, understand your father's words now.
Before my dad knew it
A million pieces shattered
Okay, let's go get one like it quickly.
Before I leave my father
May Allah grant you peace, my mother.
You would know your father if he got angry, it would be like a Minon.
You are the soul of your room, and you don't come out of it.
Nothing like it.
The vase fell and broke by mistake.
Ugh, I'm scared for him.
Mom, where are you going?
La la la, this is his father's fault.
You shouldn't do this to your son like this, my love.
The Berber in his heart is broken, he wants to return to his family, this.
I'm saying, Mom.
You're worried, right? Where is the boy going?
Okay, just let me know if you want to do a phone for you.
May God protect us.
My aunt, I know where the baby went.
Come, I'm calling you, where are you going?
Ya Allah, Ya Allah
He is here
And may my mother give you a hug, I don't want to go home.
Are you there?
I haven't been to the vase.
I have no idea.
May God guide your father, to your doorstep.
Come, my love.
I don't worry about your hand as long as I'm at home, bro.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Mr. Waleed.
Your student’s student, Abu Waleed
Just for Basam?
I see him at home.
Where is he? Where has he gone?
Where is he?
Seriously, bro, don't be scared, your dad didn't do anything to you.
Definitely, babe.
Oh my god, dude.
I'm leaving it here, afraid that one of the kids might break it.
He told me he wanted a car just like the one that broke down for me, the one that الوليد (Waleed) wrecked.
Exactly, I went and didn't find anything but this, she's the last one in the store, she has good luck, and where are the kids?
In the room, they are studying.
Please protect her.
But these values and I will do it.
Wow!
Alright, come on, study!
Seriously, just this game and we'll do it.
Seriously, and may God protect you if you say anything bad about my uncle.
Seriously, don't say your brother is right. Seriously, for the last time, seriously.
Call him
You're actually messing with your friend at the coffee shop, aren't you?
I’ll regret it if I didn’t know about your brother.
I can't connect this phone in my hiding place, Madam. Please, hurry up.
Seriously, why don't they take it for the doctor?
Oh, my God, you're killing me.
His Berber heart was trembling and he was terrified because of all he endured.
Poor kid
Be yourself
Hey, where are my jewels? I don't see them with you today.
Woody and Yaya
Dear, this doesn't get tired of playing.
Oh my God, what did you tell her about Amina and her son, Nayef?
She gave birth at the tender age of the newborn of Allah, she remembers Him.
Same length
Yesterday she told me she doesn't know what to do with her son.
She wanted him to go to the hospital, but her husband, Youssef, didn't want to.
I found out about the thing last night.
Wow, she is amazing on it.
He says, how come you didn't tell me?
This is a psychological case.
The boy, Ibol, was robbed.
He takes his son and ties him to the porch.
Then he tells him "Sukkar again, and pee in my bed."
You are teaching ruin.
My heart aches, O Maryam.
I told her, "Eat, eat."
Eat on us with blessings.
Oh, my luck
Mommy, mommy
You know, how does your father feel?
Walla Jan, kill you from the ritual.
Oh my god, hurry up and take a shower before your dad makes you do chores.
I don't understand you.
Alas, poor souls.
They’re shouting and arguing.
I'm afraid something will happen in my life.
I need to take them to my brother's house.
Nervous me
They didn't drop the most important successful people.
Why do you want to take them to your brother’s?
We are taking 42 out of 50.
Why don't we buy fifty out of fifty?
They warned them.
I honestly agree with his point of view.
Let the emotions boil over.
My brother Ayad deserves it.
Bye bye bye bye
Last time last time
Fifty from fifty
It makes us waste our time telling them that he is our son.
Why don't you come from fifty of fifty?
Whenever, whenever, whenever I warn you, but you don't listen to the words.
What are you hearing?
Jalil al-Hayya
Give me alone, let me, let me calm him down, okay?
It's okay, Uncle.
So that you review it properly the second time around, you’ll return.
Oh my god
Do you know Ashbaswi?
We're going one behind the other to make you falafel.
Be careful, don't go with me in public places.
It's ambiguities
Professor Walid is shouting.
What's up? You shouting?
This is a great grade.
It's strange that you're shouting.
It is expected that you should be happy.
You, my son, all the buses are full. I went, waiting for someone to take you.
At the school gate, it means waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got on it and weren't with them.
Have you heard about this kid who committed suicide today?
Hello, may God protect you. Here’s the certificate.
His father will be angry if he doesn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid, come back, Walid.
I greet you live and welcome you to a new episode of the program Without Limits.
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total sources of various energy.
While the rest go to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
And then, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone possess six hundred and eighty-six billion barrels.
Following Iran with 12 percent, then Iraq with 10 percent, then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with 9 percent.
Each has its own, and then Venezuela comes with seven percent.
Then Russia by 50 percent.
The Gulf and Iran constitute two-thirds of the world’s reserves.
To unprecedented prices and exceeding $109 for the first time in its history
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil.
The problems that these countries face.
Despite the huge increase in prices
And the problems that citizens and residents in these countries face
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise
Which will appear one after the other on the screen or be written to us via our website at www.aljazeera.net
Today, the market is the main factor.
And the producing countries are not
The force of the market that determines the price.
It is not OPEC
Of course, the offer and the demand have a part, of course.
But other factors
Other factors are the political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets
and the premium markets and others
And head to the prices of Al-Mazarbeh's rugs.
In commodities, and oil as an example
And tomorrow, one thousand dollars will arrive, and God knows.
Oil jumped from $44.40 to $414 in 2040
And today we see that even oil prices
It oscillates between one day and another
Oil prices have fallen below $90.
And it rose in the second quarter
Especially the entry of spring two, entry of most refineries in a period of maintenance.
It is always regarding the second quarter girls.
Demand for seasonal oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all of this doesn't indicate that the speculators have power or control over the market now.
Returning to the traditional market means that...
The market was affected by supply and demand.
The The The Seasonal Request
Today we see a growth in the economy
Today or yesterday, the General Fallon, commander of the Middle East region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a huge reaction due to its connection with the expected American war.
Political or geopolitics
It affects the oil market in a very quick, either positive or negative way.
The effect may certainly come for him, and it will have its effects.
Even the gamblers also engage in political bickering.
Some people say that the American war against Iran is coming.
Here, what will the market be optimistic about?
Question under the esteemed presence of the Deputy currently under the shadow of the White House.
This has returned the area to a state of tension.
This is the camel.
But perhaps Falun Dafa considered this scenario
A very rapid reflection is impacting the oil market.
Today we are proving with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example in the past seven weeks.
In the United States, its oil reserves have increased beyond the five-year average.
Today, I mean, I don't really say
And not even for the coming war, because today I’m telling you even the world has, has a stock, a stock.
Even global consumption today, look at which country in the world there is a long line or queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What danger does this matter represent to
What number do you expect might be, I don't know, maybe?
Mitten might be three hundred dollars, it could be less but
It could happen if these tensions reach the Torah to real tensions.
As I said, the Gulf accounts for sixty percent.
In a country, like one that's far away, even from oil-producing countries.
The effect comes back on the oil market negatively.
It can reach three hundred dollars.
And they moved from stocks and other things to the oil market today. Look up at two to three trillion or two to three trillion dollars.
Today we are looking at the print.
He's dealing with it above the 100 barrels per day, what that means
This ongoing tension in the region and anticipation.
April had been said to be the month for launching this war
Wa Allah, Allah al'a'lam, ana lam ya'ni jili.
In the area, the Al-Al now.
This was an election year.
The current American administration only needs a few months.
George W. Bush started the war in Somalia and sent thirty thousand soldiers in his last days at the White House.
We see, but we do not anticipate events.
But I don't expect this scenario will be
This Sina scenario is very expensive.
You won't incur any costs. You are the ones who will pay, you and the Iranians, and the consuming countries.
America today
Now, I rely on African oil and it has many alternatives.
Look, let's talk calmly.
You said in a video in your introduction that sixty percent
Oil precautions
But now they import twenty-two.
From their oil, from the west, from the northwest African region
From West Africa and whatever they import from any region in the world.
Oil production
This is a difficult number and installed precautions and precautions.
Deepwater or seabed production from the deep sea
The Navy and therefore the Gulf will continue to be difficult.
Caspian Sea oil
I consider them like dreams because they are not reality and truth.
They'll destroy it and ruin it.
The thing is, there is
Today, Qatar is the largest energy producer in the world.
The problem with this is these countries are difficult.
There are and the needs of countries for energy
It certainly emphasizes what is called supply chain security.
Despite internal opposition from the United States, even down to General Fallon
But there are still concerns
Who is the president Bush?
He noticed that the political risks did not come from the Gulf countries.
It means "la la la" is not a compliment to the generosity because we don't have anyone who can deal with generosity.
It’s about a lot in dealing with kindness.
But it's not in this article.
We are not part of a charitable organization.
Please.
But with the Westerners, not with anyone else.
With America, specifically
Where is the market?
What is the economic return for us, where are we going to get it from?
We will not
Like oil and gas
You put it for generosity and
I have the evidence.
I have the evidence.
It doesn't exceed sixty to seventy dollars.
It's not the price increase
But the decline of the dollar that you insist
You are first of all as Gulf and Opec.
And the export should be in dollars and you reject
Changing the currency despite the currency collapsing from then on
Despite the fact that the return is not in your favor
I'm not first seventy.
This expert talk isn't my talk.
Okay, the dollar decreased by fifty-three percent and oil rose above that decrease.
That is, if we take the measurement year in 2004
We see them as oil prices that are, like, between five and thirty to six and thirty dollars.
It means, yeah, of course, I mean
Oil prices have increased.
The increase is slight, the deputy's effort.
means if we take them
We consider it, you know, like this now.
Even these prices
It means if we compare it to fifteen and four.
Ugh, I've gone beyond even the percentage of the dollar's decline.
The thrill
It interacts with the decline of the dollar.
As the dollar decreases, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market is starting to feel.
The current state is preserving the state.
Now the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the decline two years ago, this was said, but the situation has changed now and there is now…
And the dollar began to lose its value against major currencies such as the euro, the yen, and the pound sterling.
The question here is why you insist on linking your currency to the dollar.
The currency is weakening and has no cover.
This is this this historical era
Crude oil and its derivatives in US dollars, and so far, production in Europe, the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It states that the US was in the mid-seventies
The cover removed the gold that was on the American currency.
This is not this not correct
First medicine what is correct
The OPEC includes
four Gulf residents
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia
Today is the OPEC meeting in the global market.
four hundred percent
Today, if we take the world consuming 58 million barrels
Wow, you're dealing with the dollar in pricing your oil.
If you price it in another currency, everyone will suffer.
You cannot you.
All countries that export oil must agree.
From the adults
Those who have 66% of the global reserve are the elders.
They thought, but I took it was for export.
Anyone who is within it, from Venezuela, Libya, and Iran.
Cameroon, Angola, and Qatar are countries organized under the OPEC organization.
Do not exceed your allocation today in the market to 40 percent.
Produced and issued from countries outside the OECD
And this cannot achieve 100 percent ownership.
She cannot live unless
I've tried in those countries but
Attempt is not really me.
You are refusing because of the ties with America.
From the dormitory to another job
All the countries that export oil
How much cargo oil did one barrel hold?
It’s a loss when he releases it.
And the work I did rose very high.
He sells his testicles for dollars.
Now, the one who has the reservoir is receiving it, taking his money in dollars and then converting it to his local currency.
He made it, it's not related to the dollar.
Correct, but he/it is.
But your problem is also you, you sell in dollars and your currency is not linked to the dollar, you don't have a problem.
My important question now
What is anxiety and what impact does your work’s relationship to the dollar have, given the dollar’s decline?
Has been connected for a long time
Especially in the seventies when the dollar was a very strong currency and it had a very great power.
This detachment isn't easy.
The paint is easy.
Here here here
Divorce has costs.
It has interests with some countries and not against them.
Profit and loss
Dogenz announced in his post yesterday that there are four countries and there is Qatar.
But there is also a report from Albilad Bank saying that there are four Gulf countries, because obviously Oman has exited the unified Gulf currency.
I read the statement in Dungeons and I don't think it's a real statement.
Wow, the Governor of the Qatar Central Bank was deported.
He said yes and said that he will study, but also it must be that all the Gulf countries
You need to study profit and loss in a way as I told you, methodically, without emotions.
Let's leave it, let's leave the matter for study and consideration until they come.
A cavity after a duct, economists say, is being studied in another study.
This study reflects
Loobal House is a simple, clean, and organized place, and it was released in a report on March 8th, meaning.
Apple four days only
Qalob Al House the solution is simple and requires a political decision
The political decision boils down to two truths.
There is no substitute for necessity.
Regarding her intention and the five with her, and Kuwait regarding her intention in 2010 issuing the currency or studying the issuance of the Gulf Common Currency
The second point is that a decision is issued to disengage from the dollar.
Regarding the single currency
I, in my personal opinion
We see the unified Gulf currency.
Currency, currency when this currency will be strong
will be
Perhaps it’s the strongest currency in the world, as you say.
And what’s on its way of precautions and what’s on its way of huge revenues.
So, this is what His Excellency the Prime Minister didn't focus on when he said…
Oh, the Gulf countries, because no country can stand alone.
And a stronger economic plan
And today's economic conglomerate, even the Euro today, we see it.
But you really shouldn't forget that the Central Bank has a very big role.
In the evaluation
Profit and Loss Account
From all of this news
Tense situation
According to observers, Global House stated that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by 70 percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
For stopping the inflation process
What time do they raise the salaries of wealthy people in Qatar?
And listen to my answer after a short break.
Today’s episode is about oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
She has 86 billion reserves.
Two out of ten barrels
And I criticize nine watts two from ten days daily.
A million Kuwaitis are one hundred and one and a half, and there are one billion and seven hundred and seven from ten million.
Diameter: 12,820,000,000 and 56,500,000 five and six from 10,000,000,000 and 7,000
Bahrain has a population of five and twenty million and three hundred and thirty thousand.
The total revenue was eighty-three billion in the year.
From two thousand and three to two thousand and seven
100 billion in Europe
Sixteen billion in the Middle East and forty billion
In Asia and other countries
However, the combined GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was in 2017
Total output in 2079 and 10 billion is expected.
In the year two thousand and eighteen and twenty-one from ten billion
But inflationary pressures are devouring the wages of employees and those living in this region.
He will increase from 2080 to 3800 from 10.
Kuwait 14% expects in 2018 of 10 United Arab Emirates
Saudi Arabia’s oil production will rise from six and a half to six.
Eight out of ten
Salaries are being devoured.
What amounts and percentages will you increase the employee’s salary by, you guys?
If we want to solve the problem
Real processing
Salaries are always salary increases, salaries are always salary increases.
It's not the solution.
I am not in favor of increasing salaries.
Correct, this is not correct.
We are always
Of course, in faith.
An increase and lack of control over the enlargement will consume all these increases.
To treat the enlargement and the upper committee that includes all experts and specialists
And now this committee is placing
Because the increase in salaries worldwide
And the golden economic rule says, of course
It will have no end.
And no matter what
Salaries increased and no matter how much they increase
It will increase in inflation
The treatment must be done and the treatment must be done.
Here, through a scientific study, the site بيت دوت كوم, a specialized employment institution, conducted a study in partnership with YouGov in Britain.
We conducted a scan of 15,000 employees working in Gulf countries across 20 key sectors.
Especially experts and zoa al-wazifah, there is no satisfaction and in.
Inflation is now devouring
No experience holders
They are thinking about moving from these countries where inflation is eating them up.
You are now going to lose.
This is the simple idea, you know, and this is when you put the simple idea and try to apply it.
Inflation is like a rise in wages.
Parallelism is present in the subject.
Present and
We are eager, and the state and the government are very eager.
On this device, I'm rendering this shape with real rendering.
Timers never solve the problem, they just make it worse.
It increases it.
Please allow for more time until this committee is ready.
All applications
Here, the deputy and you, his follower.
The shouting will always be.
The state also tried and raised the percentage increases by 40 percent.
There isn't a key point here regarding increases.
You only increase the increases for Qataris, and if non-Qataris were to do the same for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe
You should consider the Qataris and not the expatriates.
And it has a high ratio in it.
Ya Ahmed, ent عايش في قطر مش في ألمانيا.
You speak about this topic and suffer.
Higher salaries in the public sector, certainly
And conversely, we saw
Government subsidy
And conversely, the public sector has become
The best elements and competencies have become
I also read a report while we know in Qaf, a sector of oil.
For the workforce
We, when we act like experts, we have
The engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
And because we also interact with the global market.
For each tremor, what is the percentage increase in salaries?
And hope is with God, the Exalted in His Majesty, but I say
The government has a plan.
I'm saying controlling the proliferation is more important.
Time treatment
And I will see you, and I am sure.
There will be
Positive results
You will be within fifteen percent.
Haloo bi'ool qaa'ilk khamsah itnaan wa 'ishreen milyar min an-naft wa khamsah wa thalaath wa arba'ah milyar min al-ghaz.
No comment. We are the client, not his client.
Operation and of course we
The hadith about economic growth also must reflect on the people.
And of course, any economic growth today, Qatar is the highest economic growth in the world.
And the reverse.
The big belts in town are also part
But for these thick belts and huge projects
In the country, there wasn't also a share of the expansion.
Also part of the swelling
And this also led to a lot of liquidity in the market.
Regarding the relationship between the dollar and oil
Oil collateral for protection from
In the United States and therefore, this type of government means…
Thank you.
Saad Alghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad.
Peace be upon you and blessings of Allah.
The truth is, the loop is successful and a good title.
What I would like to touch upon is the region now, under the current American policy
America's policy in its current war, including the cultural war it is waging against Islam there, is a global economic war.
In Yemao, An China
The US deficit also reached sixty-six billion dollars.
Japan also invested in the year 2000
With America, there's nine equivalent.
One billion dollars while it is now investing more than twenty-seven billion dollars with the European Union
In tandem with American politics and in making the dollar the inevitable currency of the world.
Brother, I'm saying buy now.
And the region of the Gulf will become
It means like a place, a spot.
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohammad Al-Waheef from Egypt
Welcome, Deputy, to his efforts.
The Deputy reminds me of Arab rulers, his region is the Middle East.
When there is
When there are congestion or requests for price adjustments
Adjusting the salaries according to the prices as you preferred.
He means, in Qatar, we consider you, you are the example.
And he is determined not to announce this increase – it’s an Arabic style.
We want the area of Abu Adrikah to be considered as belonging to Qatar.
Wow, what is this? What is this saying? He says whatever he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? It's his right, of course. He's responsible for his own policies.
Question first
The deputy rushes to consider her with a keen eye.
One two add up to the public opinion
With the vulgar like what your majesty favored, because those are the people who accept being treated with care.
The Arab rulers who don't care about the common people.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
I want to be with you both and be on the Al-Qaila.
I want a raise too.
The salaries are great and good, that's good.
May God protect you. As for the topic, the one that we need to understand.
With swear words and always, God willing, there shouldn't be any swear words in Qatar, and we are sure.
And it makes the judgment that a country like Qatar is that the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
This is the important question now.
Hey, let's respond to the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What's happening with the wealth?
Now there are new cities, complete and almost like pearls, like Lucille, and other places, even Qatar is starting to expand.
I don't understand the story, the story is
A life plan proportionate
In short, there were two minutes left for him to score.
The diameter is there, it's a post-oil and gas diameter.
There is clearly a policy for the country.
I don't know.
stable wealth
It is a stable wealth.
And so today the trend in the state of Qatar
Capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see that we are the reliable city, the educational city.
Today this educational city includes the best universities in the world.
Establish medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Today, oil and gas are not
Of course, we don't imitate anyone.
Other television channels and
The Jazeera isn't just about doing a million Jazeera's, and you're not able to handle the Jazeera.
Man, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
The flower in the seventies, now everyone remembers the flower of the seventies.
Today today we when we see in Qatar of growth
And this also calls for a special episode about Qatar after oil.
Our vision of oil and its future and wealth in the region, especially in Qatar, concludes with my greetings from the program team.
This is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without limits. Peace be upon you, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
Peace be upon you and blessings of God.
Greetings live from Doha, the capital of Qatar, this week.
Welcome to my new episode of the program Without Limits.
At the time when Qatar has the largest American military base outside the United States, which is the Air Number base.
With the enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Her doors are open for guidance.
It is true that Hamas leaders enjoy close relations with the Qatari leadership.
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
The person who visited the Southern Suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006
And its continued, unlimited support for rebuilding what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
While Qatar reconciled
With her elder sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about two years ago.
At the same time, issues with the system in Egypt.
Like Lebanon, where what others failed, succeeded.
He gathered the Lebanese leaders in Doha, where they reached an agreement that secured their safety.
To the last elections
Also, the files are rigid.
What mattered to her was to be the driving force behind these files, not their diameter.
Smallest Arab countries
In today’s episode
We are trying to understand the foundations and rules that govern Qatar's foreign policy.
For the benefit of
Small Qatar, geographically and in terms of its population, fulfills these great roles.
What are the qualifications that enable him/her?
That was in a live conversation with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Foreign Minister.
For those who wish to participate, they can contact the program's phone numbers which will appear one by one on the screen.
The visit by the Emir of Qatar
The defender of Al Jazeera channel, Bader Al-Otaibi, expresses a desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, an attempt to overthrow Saudi Arabia by Qatar, in cooperation with members of the Marrah tribe.
In the issue that was published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the from the from the matters that
I didn't think it was a minute.
It's accurate that I have been in more than one interview here in this program, and I always used to say
And we consider it the backbone.
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then go
And differences of opinion
I finished the border paperwork correctly, and this was a big obstacle.
Saudi-Qatari historical relations are special.
These relationships, if we observe them
Between the two families and between the two countries
A young man afflicted him with much misunderstanding.
Neither before us nor before them
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And supply and relations in a state I can confirm is very excellent.
To the Office of the Council of Cooperation
But how was Al Jazeera's situation resolved with Saudi Arabia? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to it in the year 2000?
In an important point
And I keep telling you, if you go back to all the programs, I always used to say
Not only the elder brother, but I am saying that our reliance in the Council of Cooperation on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And with them, we give them importance.
There was media sparring, and this was clear to both sides.
These countries found themselves
She failed when the Muslim Brotherhood agreed.
The Qatari-Saudi house
They found that the most important thing they disagreed about.
They have nothing to do with it, nor donkeys.
And I don't believe it was a strategy from anyone involved in this dispute.
But Sheikh, please, let me, let me here in this frame so that things and points are clear and above board.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera channel has in the last two years
As the situation that was criticized on Al Jazeera television still persists
Before the situation inside Saudi Arabia
Whether it’s prisoners, dissidents, or others, the list remains.
The Al-Jazeera channel stopped dealing with these issues.
Even Al Jazeera’s coverage of the pilgrimage
Praising the system and and and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts
I won't ask Al Jazeera administration about this topic, don't ask me either because I...
The two countries are uniting.
Stability of the region
This strategy has continued and strengthened, first by stabilizing the region.
The region you mean is the Gulf region.
Gulf region
There are many eyes watching the Persian Gulf region.
Also, a call from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait
It had an impact on all the communities and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about settling and surpassing Arab disputes and burying them.
It's not just in opinions, it means...
Law is in the policies, and policies are viewpoints.
The Arab world considers that this
A kind of war
While in the advanced world
You are talking about the same office.
Now you've only got a few more years left.
The situation is the situation is.
First
There is a complete difference between this topic and that topic.
The idea is that a small state attacks the big ones and makes them feel weak in front of it.
Every disagreement or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And its reasons ended.
The matter ended by the decision of the commanders.
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and the common interest that brings the two countries together.
And the leaders’ words are considered more than documents.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship
And we are hoping that many of these Saudi-Arabian relationships will develop.
For the best and there are large areas.
For this relationship, like we have model B with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Regarding the diameter of a state is important.
Saudi Arabia is an important country.
Egypt, in relation to Qatar, is what country? So, even if it’s noticed at the same time that you reconciled with Saudi Arabia
And three organizations are Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera is a channel.
Or, regarding the system in Egypt, the largest Arab countries.
First, let me start with the beginning, then the following.
The Egyptian people
Egypt’s people respect
And her attention
With many Arabic remnants and Egyptian popular demonstrations
And this is a view.
Someone thinks that this is a way to enter a place for communication or lack of communication with the brothers in Egypt.
Under this, under this, you are contributing to respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people, let
And we believe he is a good person.
Our dispute with Egypt is over two points.
It's a dot.
We put in that we are ready for a coup in Gaza and I don't think
And we are not entering
In the perspectives of other countries
I do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is a need for reform.
There has been no intervention from you regarding the Hamas uprising against the authority in Gaza.
Of course, it's not like we actually know anything about this – we only know what the others know through the media.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt differ or have a disagreement with you regarding that point?
I'm coming here.
Hezbollah conspiracy
Hezbollah conspiracy and also
But I am talking about my country
We were very surprised by this subject.
If it vibrates for the interest of Qatar
Al Ahram TV
She said the pyramids.
To undermine Egypt and its standing
Maybe I can
Let's return to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this matter.
The beginning is not from Gaza conference.
And I justify, I absolve her from the Egyptian people, I absolve her from President Hosni Mubarak.
If we go back very far to the Mina conference
After the Madrid conference, the marina that was held in Doha is remembered.
And this was the agreement that the conference was supposed to be held here.
They said that we don't want to hold the conference.
Guys, we know that you have an agreement with Israel
From Qatar and this thing
What is it that we want to understand?
We sat and went to talk, and the conversation was always good.
It has two parts.
What are they
In opposition
In the political direction
We if we come to the Gaza conference that happened
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
And we received it from a foreign country.
The brothers in Egypt have an opinion on this topic, and what is hindering it.
And we watch as people are killed.
If you don't want to listen in Doha, we can arrange it anywhere on campus.
And it is shameful that on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference, I discussed the issue of
By Israel and the Western world, standing by, watching the issue.
When we came, we said okay, now this one is moving forward or not, or there is no power. We Arabs cannot stop it. A major state has stopped this fighting.
Egypt's announcement of a call to halt fighting in Qaz followed by a ceasefire six hours later.
Even we
We must not take the Arab Street with this kind of foolishness; we disagree with the brothers on only one point.
And this is in accordance with international norms.
And my hospitals aren't enough doctors stood at the limit.
You stopped at the border.
There was and it was a limit to who entered
The brothers are feeling very bad about this situation.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered a part of national property.
When we talk about any human issue in any place in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect the esteemed Egypt.
And we know a position, but this doesn't reflect the Egyptian situation.
We hope a lot in Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe you are able to reach our voice and the voice of others in the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even after a raft rescue.
What the Europeans tried to save it in
What happened in Gaza as a result of the conference
Whether it's a donor conference or something like that, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to the conference, we were invited to coordinate between the countries of the Gulf Council.
And we commenced in the Council of Cooperation
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
I will spend it.
To the parties concerned in Gaza
Directly and this was
Entry is prohibited from everywhere.
I rejoice, Egypt and every people of Qatar rejoice in Egypt because Egypt
Egypt’s victory in political matters is important to us.
But you are anticipating.
Just give me, just give me two minutes
One of the ministers boasted about what was saved.
And whoever disputes Egypt here, will find his spine broken and his arm shattered.
"Wallahi, I think this official has wronged his country."
They haven't failed and they can't speak except about themselves, if we're being honest.
The person who helped them in this and in other matters, I told my brothers in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis intervened because the King has his wisdom in this matter.
I don't understand the affairs in the Arab world
We agree
The King decides that this is the interest.
We are responding to King Abdullah's decision, as we respect and trust him.
But if someone prevented them, we stopped them from humiliating those who were prevented.
They were like students in a school.
I think this means
The limit is its origin.
He believes that he should impose his power.
We're sorry, we're sorry about this topic.
If they think a small country has no right to have its rights revoked
You're going in and sticking your nose into Darfur.
Arab decision in the Arab University
Africa and a decision by the United Nations
I believe the main problem
Hezbollah conspiracy, its details are in Qatar.
Conspiracy, I don't know the diameter.
If it starts somewhere after swine flu, it could be due to a bacterium that the virus can spread.
The diameter of the state of Peace knows its size and its capabilities.
But Qatar has its own point of view.
It has a separate policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue we consider it an honor.
Because of the Arab League
Any Arab opinion that we believe weakens our position before our main rivals, which are Palestine and the rest of the rivals that I face.
The Arab world has become a receiver.
Even our analyses have become the same as yours.
Western analyses
While the Pakistan we know is what we’ve known about what happened in Pakistan
And by Allah, I need someone to receive me and lay a red rug for me in Washington.
Would anyone criticize Qatar?
Did Qatar cause harm to any Arab country?
I tried to contribute with money.
The comments were provocative.
What's possible is that I could say "peace be upon you" and you respond with "peace be upon you" just to annoy me.
This is another case, meaning you have a problem or you're lacking something.
This is a personal matter for you, not for me.
But if you have an internal problem
I always say it
And especially after the speech of the Saudi Arabian Minister of Defense and Crown Prince, His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah
In Kuwait, and I know this man, he is honest.
And a man’s words are what he intends them to be.
La la la, la la la, this la la this words I always say.
I always say this.
I always told this when we were in the middle of a dispute with Saudi Arabia.
And go back to the entire document you have in the archive.
The story is different la la la
One-sided we said no, that's final, we're stopping here at this point.
And we tried as much as possible.
I don't want to get into this topic.
They'll see their affairs, they'll see their mistakes where.
We admit our mistakes, it doesn't mean that everything we have is right.
His Excellency Sheikh
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt
Firidon wants to get out of it.
Qatar denies any involvement in plots against Egypt externally and has cut ties with Turkey and other countries.
I swear, we have supernatural power.
And Mashallah, seventy million if we are able to rise/stand, eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be addressed.
You played a role in the Qandeel Shlita case despite knowing that this file was a sensitive file for the Egyptian government.
And I strove with the French.
We received a call from a friend's country.
We saw her in the corner and said, "Brothers, this is what Egyptians say."
We want to see this topic by request.
By Israel and other countries, to a prophet to see another side of this issue
When we saw this topic, they told us, "My brother, if the same conditions as those brothers you're talking to the brothers in Egypt..."
This is what we announced, meaning, there's one responsible person saying we're laughing at all the Arab universities.
Wa Allah, hatha ya'ni, ya'ni maskeen.
It means how they burdened us with it.
The President Mahmoud Abbas remains
And we have this hand.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is coming from you guys.
I think I think this is a health phenomenon
I'm not a journalist like they accuse me of being.
And Al Jazeera needs to enter the media competition like there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets going through a rebellious phase where they all criticize each other.
But after a while, they will reach the stage of maturity.
can can and and affiliation
First, we are with Saudi Arabia and our position differs.
And even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is important, but there is privacy in Saudi-Egyptian relations.
And also, privacy for Egypt with any Arab country. Egypt is the largest country.
This is correct. This is correct, but with Saudi Arabia in history and with a differing relationship.
It’s a personal matter between officials here and there.
We respect His Excellency the Egyptian President
Please limit it to disagreements in policies, not viewpoints.
I told you there was a problem when an attack happened on Gaza.
The second problem is that they are sensitive to it, something we haven't discovered yet from anything Qatar is doing, or something like that.
Mazaa does not currently have the opportunity to meet with the Egyptian President between the Prince.
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And as for the newspapers said first thing was secret listening then we found it on the day after that
I heard a conversation between me and Omar Suleiman.
Saudi Arabia
Lost cause
And I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's just say that after someone says no, you're comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether for the young or the old.
The Minister is seeking a suitable concession.
The children's game
I didn't think this Egypt is bigger than this. I think it's a failure of expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you the people of Egypt waiting for divine intervention?
This this, please. I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that, because God knows who is living and who is dying.
Hey, I'm calling.
He or she should believe there is a style
And we are proud of Egypt
There must be a certain way.
Either stop with me, or stop beside me.
How much pain does any Arab citizen suffer?
In the Arab world, we suffer from it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
Countries derive their strength from sources of strength.
The United States has sources of power China has sources of power France has sources of power a small state Qatar has sources of power
I will not rely on God’s will.
It's obvious that there's nothing in it.
This is a crash, you guys are starting it.
But we are a small country in my eyes and on my head.
And I repeat it a thousand times.
So no one says that we are sensitive.
No one will confiscate it.
You have now, regarding Israel, stirred things up.
Doctor before I go to Israel
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem, they weren't first
And every day they file complaints against America, if I told you the biggest countries you're talking about.
And they deal with us out of self-interest, and we deal with them out of self-interest.
All complaints and all
In the سبيل تخريب العلاقة
I believe it diminishes any major state that does so.
And also, our Arab pride decreases when we go to run and complain to each other.
Everything comes and everything we know.
Our vision is to be based on Arab interest.
And we’re with them in anything.
Are there any further steps to repair relationships
But I know there were intimate relationships between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone moved any things
If the rapprochement between the two countries and the parties is not achieved, he will find himself a loser, for in the end
It's impossible to hate, it might be possible after ten years. I honestly don't know, we're always from their side. Anyone invites us to a conference, we attend.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend and if we have any opinion, we say it at the conference.
We can’t be you.
Egypt is our elder sister in any matter, but we have our own point of view and we discuss.
This is all that's needed. Whenever the time comes, we are of course happy with this topic.
It has been cancelled due to political turmoil.
And as I mentioned, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, here’s the translation: “Naturally, canceling the contract and adding another contract you’re asking about the cancellation fee. Ask how many Egyptians went to Qatar at the same time.”
But if a state policy is like what you told me, the Egyptian people are close to us, like a part of our hearts in Qatar.
On June 4th of last year, you stirred the emotions of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office on June 4th, and its publication.
Why do you say you were tickling us, when we wanted to be tickled by them for twelve years? We closed it.
When we were together, when everyone was supporting Hamas before reconciling with Israel and before secret meetings between the Arab countries and Israel began.
And after and after and after and after and after they reconciled most Arabs.
Whether under the table or above the table with Israel, or speak to them in any capacity.
If we wanted to tickle the feelings, we tickled them at the previous Islamic Conference.
In the United Nations, Nasser held a symposium at the Israeli ambassador's office in Bilakji.
Yes, he was a guest from among many guests attending the ambassador’s speech. I don’t know what occasion he held it for.
Because we in the United States sit next to each other with Israel, so there’s no one who denies this topic.
We found a glimmer of hope in lifting the burden from our brothers in Palestine.
Now the administration has changed, and I was handling the Egypt matter, but unfortunately it will be smaller.
She didn't grow up. You made her grow up.
My question is about the United States and the new administration, and the impact that will have on the relationship between Qatar and the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There is a difference of opinion.
The road is facing multiple scenarios in the area.
And if they are serious, we will help them to the fullest extent.
I anticipate a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these awnings have been solved.
The Emir of Qatar visited Paris yesterday and spoke about what is happening in Iran.
And Iran has a special relationship with it despite its bad relationship with the United States.
First of all, it must be placed within the frame of the internal Shaan (domain), because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri in this program said that the Doha agreement ends with the holding of the elections.
Has your vision been shaken as well, or do you see that the agreement is still in place, or will you arrive at a new agreement?
The Doha agreement reached a stage where they were able to hold peaceful elections.
It's been about two and a half years since the Doha elections.
We were following it day by day, moment by moment, until they reached the elections, according to the Doha agreement.
We intervened in the final stage of one of the electoral circles to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have an interest in the arrangement of things in Lebanon
We are always close to Lebanon, you know about the Qataris and how they love Leïla and go to Lebanon from where?
I mean, I'm the first country we might be able to visit after a strange Lebanon.
Question: Quick answer about what is happening in Yemen
You have become involved in the Houthi case, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
And your intervention at least puts them in a position of parity with the state. Now there is a greater danger, namely the danger of the South.
We suffered what we suffered. This is why the past returns, why are you stopping here? Why are you stopping here in Qatar?
And indeed, we were under a lot of pressure on this topic, but this was our vision and this is the Prince’s stance on this matter.
The Houthis' agenda
And its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
We intervened through a neutral intermediary between the two parties.
We reached an agreement.
But I understand that if this is intended to be exploited for other reasons
And I will be with them there, and we always stood with them in every topic.
And and and and nothing about health
I see that there's no need.
I'm selling them.
And I'm saying this while I apologize, I know there are many Arab audiences that will be watching.
Thank you, dear viewers, for your kind follow and for allowing us to clarify some aspects of Qatar’s foreign policy.
To conclude, we pass on our greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without limits.
And peace be upon you, and Allah's blessings and mercy.
Esteemed viewers, peace be upon you, welcome to this special interview
Bin Jassim bin Jabir Al Thani is the Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers and the Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, I’m saying I’m proposing a private and exceptional interview because…
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor.
My Lord, a simple and direct question
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese decrees from both sides were important.
Accessing results
It is very important that external interference
Many opinions or many suggestions from abroad
Arabic Lebanese international if you like say
But he went through stages.
There’s nothing except what means these stages were present.
Does the complexity in Linen mean...?
Just a moment ago
It means when you are now connected and directly entered the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese agreement is a major agreement?
Lebanese, Arab, regional, and international needs a significant decoding.
This is a small, very simple contract, but it was inflated by external intervention.
We know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and many other things.
The Lebanese should not be allowed
It affects the security and stability in Lebanon.
Problem number one
External repercussions on Lebanon
I suddenly decided, after twenty-four hours, to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane directly to meet the Emir of Qatar
It wasn't even something they could have expected, they couldn't even relax for a minute until you came upon them with what you're offering.
The secret is that if they rest and think a lot…
And they had many connections. That was the key.
We propose an idea to transfer them to Doha because we need an environment.
Or I will gather them in many difficulties, diverse.
In many circumstances
We took them out due to these circumstances because you're coming to solve it.
If we want to succeed, we must transfer them from this atmosphere.
And quickly
And Allah guides us to the truth, guides us to the clarification of the Venetian statement or the statement of Beirut.
Then we managed to convince them to agree to go to Doha.
Both decided to go to Doha.
Some people think, for example, that Qatar is a good place to be on one side of a conflict versus the other.
And from Beirut but
It means that the Prince's Highness said that if we are intermediaries
In this process
Medicine with complete honesty, the Sheikhdom.
Have you seriously consulted?
With the main parties concerned at least as it is the case in Lebanon, the Arab Republic of Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Specifically, the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud, so we...
Everyone wanted a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If you go, if you went, to the mind.
His justifications are weak.
It should have been removed because there is tension between me and Palestine.
There is a Iranian nuclear issue
The Arab University must necessarily have a mechanism for resolving disputes.
The African Union is better than us at resolving the crisis.
And he tries to gather the edges
And they hold conferences to solve the problems of the Arab world that you have accumulated, a renowned tradition for years, which they cannot.
Let them unite the Arabs or unite the parties if there is a wronged one, or intervene for his victory.
You should study
If we want there to be a health for the Arab League, not for the Arab world.
With the Arabic tool for implementation.
One of the officials here was President Najib Mikati.
Sean Sean requires
Now it appears that the Lebanese agree
Honestly, you know, we are
First comes Qatar
It has never led to a result.
For the Arab Interest
It is the strength of the Arabs.
We tried it in somewhere
In the United Nations when we went to Doha talks
And the agenda is for the subject, not for another subject.
There is no doubt
And the most important role they have in the Arab world as a whole, especially
In a state
It was stopped by our agreement.
Come help us
This is a serious topic and this serious topic but
Why have we reached a stage where everyone is playing on the field here?
In our area
It is very important that our people and the people overcome.
Now we need a peak of Arabism after this agreement to see what we will do between the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia?
What are we going to do in Somalia? It's not a member of the Arab League.
Why is it that some of us are trying to say that Sudan is not a member of the Arab League and Iraq is not a member of the Arab League?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
I hope this is what I proposed this idea.
Could Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that if we are asked to do something, we should do what we can.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria were in agreement.
Transient stage
We find it, and then, God willing.
However, I insist on asking if you allow it, could you play a role in this aspect?
Even if it’s unspoken, you’ve essentially gained trust now.
What degree of rapprochement between Arab countries are we striving for
And this is the policy of His Highness from the beginning, but, you know, this topic
Could what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is open to serious compromises?
What is happening in Lebanon is a local Lebanese matter, and regional affairs remain.
It doesn't stick to this situation very much.
I wish it were different. I wish this.
A new state of affairs in the Arab world, this is a wish.
We can create
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, is the Sheikh state fearing that the escalation that was ongoing before a while ago
At least from here to the end of President George W. Bush's era
There's nothing more than doubt, I still have worries, whether it's about the topic of Palestine, meaning currently Gaza.
I mean, it's me, I want to ask.
I don't want anything else.
He commands us to care about this human aspect in Palestine.
We cannot reach them with medicine.
And food
Electricity for the incubator in the hospital
If the electricity goes out, it doesn't...
I mean, I wish.
The Arab League agrees on an amount for this topic: medicine and food. I specify medicine and food.
Man, we don't want the Red Crescent to arrive.
Deliver the Red Cross.
But with all due respect, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to go into details about this topic. I'm just saying that as Arabs, we must get the medicine and the fuel, even if we're different, with enthusiasm.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted effort and pledged at the Sacred Kaaba.
This is a dispute that will only benefit the other party.
Do not deal with this party because we will not be able to provide you with a solution to this is incorrect.
And I
So far, I don't see any signs of a solution.
Do you fear encountering an Iranian-American during the next NFL season, or do you prepare for it?
That's possible, of course, we are.
At least I'll talk about the state of Qatar
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We may not agree on all of their policies or they may not agree on all of their policies in Qatar.
They, for example, are saying that we don't want your relationships with Israel or your contact with them.
Perhaps some consider you to be necessarily a party through the American rules existing there.
This topic, we know how to deal with it.
Some people said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
As if he met or consulted or spoke with the Saudi family
In Istanbul, there are discussions between Syria and Israel.
And I can say it's a matter of chance.
Topic 2: The Kingdom was keen to find a solution and I was communicating with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last hours
Tactical change, tactical change of discussions
By you or by the parties?
We, as officials, are responsible for this.
And from you from all sides, and we locked ourselves in the same room.
And finally, we found ourselves that after the Prince Sheikh intervened, it was important.
And from among it, the invention arose.
The end without mentioning it now.
And the message was clear when he said, “We know our size and our location and our role, until the end, as if
He wanted to play a mediating role without provoking any other party.
Whether Arabic, regional, or international
However
became a responsibility
Do you want that or not?
It means that some envy among us, we want to avoid envy because we are countries.
These countries
You can work or
I think this is the most comfortable combination.
Perhaps a difficult or final question is your current relationship with Washington? Is it a deep and enduring connection?
That means our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say.
It does not lack different viewpoints in approaches
But this is a shot and if they talk about democracy, this is democracy
How is it good, I mean, how do you translate it to the ground that it's good, your relationship with
If you’re talking about economics, she’s great. If you’re talking about education, she’s great.
If you're talking about health, I can tell you it's good. If you're talking about politics, I can tell you it's fine.
In my opinion, and clearly during the upcoming phase.
I think we should drop the topic of confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the arena/field in the Arab world.
We repair the rift between Palestinians
We must agree on an opinion so that we can be a respected force.
I don't think we have
We are to be an effective thing
Thank you to our viewers, dear viewers, for your kind support and until we meet again, God willing, with my sincere appreciation.
Welcome viewers to this dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani
In this conversation
We are trying to foresee the political reality of the Arab world and Arab efforts.
Welcome, Sheikh. Happy to have you.
To understand what is happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this conversation we can
Let's cast our ablutions on some of your questions.
Entry of the State of Israel into Gaza by land.
And our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Her dealings with friendly countries
And the sisterly countries
And how to attempt to establish a clear and strong Arab stance/position.
And then we find fields for reconciliation
By us, we know that more than one Arab country has violated
In a haphazard way
And no one is accounted for while
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
The only two worlds we always target
We always educate in a style
I think.
to the point that we won't be able to
We are meeting at the level of leaders
We stopped his punishment. We are the ones.
We wanted to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal approvals.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of listening is not
We hope it’s correct and that our perspective is wrong, because the goal…
Solve the problem now is not the goal of achieving the peak.
But is it clinging to the blood of the Palestinians
What we demanded – the current ministerial lineup – does not cancel our request for Qatar.
And it's also like this, His Highness
In his speech, we are not insisting that if the embarrassment is to be in Qatar, it should be in Qatar. The summit should be wherever it is.
An Arab stance that respects others
Yes, as for the ministerial
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
And Israel
She wasn't involved in the decision and continued killing and shelling in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we are doing.
What are we doing?
What happens after Israel finishes?
It implements what remains of the Security Council resolution
If there is a situation, given that Israel has not stopped
Shoot for no, our brothers are not forced.
On a decision considered that invoice
From a few days ago
We will discuss the Ministry's listening.
Do you ultimately support this proposal?
We support a summit of Arab nations, of course, and this is our idea and the idea of several other Arab countries as well. We requested the summit in Syria and Yemen.
Live in a crack of Arabic
او همه افروزنا الى معسكر اعتدال
And the camp of the imbalanced
And excess/imbalance, what do they mean by that?
The Farzina West
The Arabs who call themselves moderates and the Arabs who are not moderates
We don't find that there is a moderate mother and a non-moderate mother.
And then we need to know what moderation and immoderation are. Is moderation walking according to Israeli plans?
And and ending the story in a humiliating way
Or we just need to keep the story alive.
This is an important question.
The topic means whether the countries
She is following Israeli plans and wants to solve the issues in ways
I'm not saying it goes according to Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call a training camp "Equilibrium Camp"
What is moderation in the West's view?
Do we agree to slaughter a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, there were elections that took place.
I'm not a supporter or opponent of Hamas, but I'll talk about the reality.
The reality is that there is
Idea
Some of those who call themselves the radical movement
But we have to ask ourselves what this radical confidence is demanding.
Something is not right with her, is she a student deserving her rights?
We are mixing them up.
And We create other nations too.
It seems like
Internal Arabic Thought
This seemed to be happening.
And so we don't want to wage a war on behalf of others.
Yes, happiness, old man, in short.
Who prevented the Arab Summit?
I can't say 'ban' because there are testimonies and the topic is well-known.
Subject of prohibition
But like I mentioned to you, we could have
Let's take a vote and get two-thirds.
But it wasn't this goal, because it wasn't as challenging as it was a pressing need that we believe.
It's not like it's something pointless.
Let's go to the Security Council.
Or in a decision by the Security Council
But the decision to the Security Council, Israel said: “We will continue and then we will consider the issue.”
I'm all I want to focus on again.
It's not that we're being targeted in the Decision app on the weakest side.
What will be different about the first listening?
The subject of the disputes means a habit of getting disagreements and differing opinions.
As much as it is important
Are we ready for a clear Arab confrontation?
from humanitarian aid
We support our brothers clearly and explicitly.
And also, addressing the Israeli philosophical side, I want to say it.
This assumes that what we're looking for, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab Initiative?
Eighty-four, and we are committed, we committed to the ceasefire, eighty-four, and the Israelis did not commit.
It's natural for discussions to have disagreements, but truthfully, those disagreements
It expresses situations that reflect inner states in the souls of certain individuals.
One of the maneuvers she learned is
There is someone who described Hamas' movement as fragmentation.
And not even their minority.
This is a situation that happened and we responded to it in a statement from a colleague of the ministers.
And I believe that this means what the West is saying.
And these are radical militants and these are gangs, and one says these guys are like this
And we don't want to be the men of others
And so, I always mean it, and I don't mean anything to anyone.
Any foreigner who finds
These are Western countries and these Western countries find
Among the Arabs
Yes, good, happy Sheikh now
Call for a Ministry Hearing - Second
By Allah, the schedule of his work is one thing.
Where are you from? Are you Arab? What's happening with the three-hundred-year-old nation, and what's its situation?
A million Israeli Soft
That resulted in a decision issued on the 8th of 1966
The decision that was issued
Israel hasn't implemented it yet after it's completed the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation exerted an effort
He is thanked for this decision.
We are requesting Chapter 7 because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel.
And if they also ask, we say we understand.
It's not the Arabs' fault if when they
If that is the case, Israel does not ask questions.
She is above international law.
This is reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the convening of the Arab Summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will seek for us.
Needs a difficult decision
To resolution
A minister is losing his position.
We are afraid of the West.
And we are among those who witness that after they decide, for example
I don't want to go about the subject.
Those who carried out this attack on the complete reconstruction of Iraq are responsible, because they destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government or the people who died.
No objections
Exactly, the same thing in Sudan, when they first started talking about Bashir's trial.
Happiness Sheikh
Happiness Sheikh
Major Arab diplomatic victory in the Security Council
He saw that they were facing difficulties in the Security Council because it was the first thing on a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel has not complied with it
I will commit after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
They didn't abide by the decision.
It should be assumed that people adhere to it.
Israel accepts after the mission was completed.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All that we did
We unfortunately implemented some brothers with great effort from them.
Gaza blockade. Join it.
I am a friend of the West and it's nothing wrong if we have a relationship with the West and I don’t…
Against the West, and against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
If you are strong, your friends are strong.
And if you have an opinion
And in the end, our opinion takes one percent, and we say we have won.
What is victory?
What does it include?
I cannot say anything about any reservations now because the decision is…
And the council was himself, سید.
You participated in the formulations.
We participated in the formulations to some extent, yes we participated.
But you did not invite the Arab ministers to listen to his American Foreign Minister.
But I'm sure the brothers who are coming will stand in for us.
He pointed to Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this field, Sheikh Al-Saud is happy.
Since two years until this moment
Look, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
I can’t claim that we see everything.
Are they Arabs?
Israeli and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here began the dispute and the siege.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And they remain gathered until we eliminate them because we don't want them to be in power.
That that parties happiness Sheikh
She clearly states that the Palestinian-Palestinian conflict
means if there is
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Maybe it was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.
I'm telling a side, you have the right, a thousand in the sea.
I'm not saying that Samira is 100% right.
I don't claim that, and I don't say that.
But the midpoint is usually a point one unit away from everyone.
I don't just mean the intermediary, I mean we, as Arabs, should be at one level with everyone.
And we don't want her to exist, so we must end it by any means through methods.
Repeatedly training right and left forces
And with their sieges and their refusal to give us money or salaries.
And we are, in fact, building a positive model in the western region.
The people in Gaza see how people are living.
Life I dislike in in in
Conversely in Gaza
You have been invited to attend the second Arab Ministerial Listening Session, but at this time
The discussion regarding it is ongoing between Hamas and Turkish mediation.
This invitation seems like an attempt to evade.
If we launched another initiative
We don't have any initiatives.
On this subject
Egypt is an important Arab country.
And she is required to undertake any Egyptian effort that leads to understanding.
But it is important
We do not come.
Tomorrow, he was heading towards someone as if he had defeated someone.
And there is no road to reconciliation.
Egyptian initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and humanitarian requirements
And the requirements of the Egyptian role, which is an important role.
These are a leading Arab country that we respect and admire.
This is what is required. What’s your opinion about Egypt?
Current initiatives proposed now do not meet those requirements, His Highness.
I have an idea about the initiative.
What was announced about it, what do we hear from here and here about it?
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the government or the Palestinian presidency, it must be present and we are all recognizing the Palestinian presidency.
But also there are people
We are waiting at the end; we should take their point of view.
In order for this mediation to succeed
Incidentally, taking into consideration
The Palestinian position was clear that this decision did not take our opinion into account, meaning how could it be issued
A decision in which Arabs participate in its drafting without contacting or taking the opinion of the main party concerned with the subject.
I need only mean that we, of course, deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
We deal with it through the authority, let's say it's like... like... a one-sided side.
But now there is a rift at one end located in a place and another end in another place.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we should abandon our dealings with the groups that are present in the West Bank or the Palestinian Authority.
We deal with the Palestinians as a people and as one government.
If they request someone from Gaza to be with them
And now we started to coordinate together.
What was announced, what was announced about her?
The decision was that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it to constitute a Jew.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from my reading of the decision is that it welcomes Egyptian initiatives.
We hope the Egyptian initiative succeeds in fulfilling
He stops the fighting
I don't doubt my brothers in Egypt.
Israel has not accepted Resolution 12.
And you consider that this decision has become as if it doesn't exist, since Israel has not accepted it.
Even if I accept it later, things have changed on Earth.
Yes, happiness is the Sheikh in the speech about Egyptian efforts, Egyptian efforts.
She also shares Turkish efforts with her at the same time, and...
About Arab impotence
He spoke about Arab disagreements that cannot reach a solution, therefore he came to occupy a place.
It was supposed that the Arab parties should occupy it.
Welcome to the Turkish situation.
And a position that must be valued Arabically and Islamically.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
And therefore, this natural role
And people have to follow me.
There is no consensus in Arabic regarding how to handle the situation.
One says let them finish the mission.
It needs to be a clear Arab stance against this aggression and its continuation and procrastination.
In a Arab position facing
Israel is capable of looting in villages. I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are people who always advocate for peace.
No and we are those, I mean, do you want to live safely?
But I don't ask for an Arab war, I ask for a stance.
Arabic and clear
In the context of discussing initiatives and proposals, of course you're following what's happening.
And the proposals and conditions that put Hamas movement forward
Do you think
Now, let's observe the field reality
And the politician that emerged from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions
He has to be right.
I agree with this point, but I don't agree with you on this point.
The second thing
They aren't here now, they're negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation like I told you.
The second thing
Okay, here's the translation: So, in the required scenarios, what are the expectations of the Arabs?
This Arab reality
The thing we witnessed following the start of those operations
I regret that there is a situation in the Arab street that is far ahead...
We are as governments
Of course, I'm sorry that some describe this popular folk song that way.
They used to tell me this topic.
Listen to the opinions of our people
The Presidents
If they want it means
At least they see what
Of course, there is a high ceiling and there is a modest ceiling.
We suspended normalization and severed diplomatic relations with Israel.
Diameter of the band
The Israeli Embassy office in Doha will close.
The diameter that this position takes.
It is considered that the Arab side should be radical and take decisive stances.
Whatever the Arabs agree on, we agree on collectively.
Let's start if there's an Arab agreement
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
Let's walk with our Arab brothers.
Just have a decision and clear Arab credibility.
And they also deal with others, not just countries that have relations
Even countries that don't have relations
Very important
We are not clients of others.
He asks why he shouldn't be a diameter in this field.
If this is the only model we’re willing to be in.
But we also want
Qatari model that adheres to part of its Arab commitment
Like
And he doesn't go to sell a limit
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
And I unfortunately don't want to say our secret, I don't want to say brokers.
And therefore, it is very important.
An official invitation to raise objections to this.
Some called for the ambassador, some presented protests, and some expelled the ambassador, like Shifaz Musla.
And this is a part of the dispute
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and some called for five permanent members of the council, and these are all films about our people.
It means we are talking about the modest ceiling of popular demand.
On the highest ceiling, there is someone demanding that Lebanon open fronts. There is someone demanding that Syria open its front with Israel.
Look, I'm telling you, we call for peace and we call for fighting with Israel.
And we do not seek conflict with Israel
To fight with Israel
And how will we agree?
Is this a problem too?
What made us talk to each other beyond our differences
He delighted me with what he said, the Sheikh is happy about it.
The condition is that countries should not sell themselves to each other.
What do you mean?
Now
The street isn’t going to spare us.
Happiness Sheikh
Is what is happening today a completion of a project that began in 1966 with the Lebanese War
It is considered that there is a difference
I don't think there is any difference between the goals.
Lebanon used to have a free spirit.
The remaining parts are obviously under the limit. It is assumed to be a deposit with the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon means that we dealt with the Lebanese crisis in a bigger way.
Israel, of course, needs the countries around it to be weak.
Even if it dominates, while it is the one with the longer hand.
And of course, in countries that I support abroad.
And therefore, she wants to remain the only strength in the area.
And Iridon
They are changing this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And which side?
While Lebanon speaks of one side in Palestine, while Palestine is speaking of a single side.
But I am returning to assure you that the problem of the Palestinians is that they listen to Arabs and foreigners a lot.
Two sides, and from here, the tension arose, and each person believed they were in control of the other side.
Your opinion as a monitor and follower
According to the plan, it ends with a fracture bone.
Are we Arabs willing to accept this, because this example may repeat for those who are stubborn?
He says his opinion.
Whether for Israelis or others, in the future
We set a bad example.
The highest in obedience and in helping to break bones.
I don't mean to offend, but there's a saying in our country about a man and his cousin versus a man and his brother-in-law.
It is assumed now that there is a dispute with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is immune from error or authority.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must not pass this topic
Turn the corner
Here, failure will be failure of the class.
Sa'ad al-Sheikh Qatar, Sa'ad al-Sheikh means for a while, it has been initiating to present proposals
And initiatives for solutions were achieved in Lebanon
That happened in Darfur. We’ll talk about this topic, you know, eventually, even in a hurry, later.
We are
I don't want to overwhelm our brothers because sometimes there's sensitivity.
If this country is doing all of this, we have no objection, as long as the issue is resolved.
We're not currently aiming to be put Qatar on the top headlines.
It wasn't among the Prince's goals.
This was his goal. How do we stop this bleeding?
And we stop this tyranny
What happened is beyond comprehension.
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something that they don't know? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
The truth to reach a distinguished solution
Talking about initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative has become in relation to Darfur, a solution for the movement of Justice and Equality.
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it is a special one that solves the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem began at the beginning
The Arabs helped
But what message did we send to the international level?
Based on that, we're seeking revenge on the regime and now we need to solve the issue, but we don't know how to solve it.
And we always witness, as I mentioned in the beginning, how decisions are applied – meaning we are the best people for decisions to be applied to.
What about the dimensions of the issue away from competition? Is there also competition in the subject of Darfur?
I don't want to get involved in this topic.
Before we conclude this speech, His Highness Sheikh is there, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
We will ban the summit.
It will be held, we wish it were held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
It's a defect.
It would be good if the Arab leaders attended this summit.
When the blood of Palestinians was paraded in their Gaza flood, and now they are uniting for financial and economic reasons.
Let's stir the pot.
But it doesn't seem like anyone is afraid of anyone in this street.
You don't know anything about the circumstances, you know? I, of course, don't wish anything bad to happen to all of us.
And we are safe.
But basically, no one is going to take someone and bring their little one.
The Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Qatari Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabir Al Thani, extends his sincere thanks.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration, and to what extent are the High Commissioner for Human Rights’ statements genuine?
People with disabilities are the most vulnerable group to neglect in the world.
What about our Arab region and its interest in this issue?
These questions and others we ask our guest for today’s episode
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability
And she holds a Bachelor of Arts in Audiology and Communication Sciences from Qatar University.
And for the master's degree in urban planning and social policies from the Egyptian Helwan University
And I activated many centers in the field of people with disabilities.
She is a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities.
Year 2000 and 1999
and the Vice President of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities from nine hundred and ninety-nine
Even two thousand and three
I also contributed to the establishment of the Center for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest was presented with the launch of many programs and projects and media campaigns.
And the activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed by giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello Mrs. Hassa, welcome to this episode.
The recognized term is people with disabilities
In the early days, we launched a designation that was disabled in the eighties and before.
Educational more when
Part of those who provide that education are located within
On the 93rd, a significant document appeared at the United Nations.
Regarding this term before we delve into the details
Despite the fact that there are regions that are not considered developed or are classified as poor, despite the existence of other regions
And America Latinia the and especially America Latinia, in reality this direction can be stronger in it than any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise.
The trend towards the rights-based approach is present in the Arab world, and you find it in many countries
Resources might be available and political will might be present.
Here, let me tell you some statistics, you probably already know about them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that almost 90 percent of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Ms. Hassa how do you comment on these statistics?
It's really true.
I first saw it in Darfur and Gaza, and in the areas that are exposed to events like these wars and conflicts.
There is no distinction between a disabled person, a disabled person, or a non-disabled person, as the numbers are large.
The literacy rate of children is approximately 53 or 52.
And in those seconds
There are many obstacles preventing these children from reaching schools, even if they do not have a disability.
The city doesn't even have infrastructure, let alone this child finding that school.
If he can access it.
For the children and for the rest of the population, it
This means these projects and agendas are wonderful, but we don't often hear about them in reality.
And when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The state of the world
The best of two options are people who don't have a disability in the first place.
There are organizations that have arrived and carried out many projects.
Implements a very important strategy for health.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between human rights and working with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
Currently, awareness in the Arab world is better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive communications and continue our dialogue.
Thank you.
I have two questions I would like to ask her, as she was a former United Nations official.
Point two, what is it?
The United Nations laws that call for, for example, combating systems that hinder the community for a child, such as my son, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime as there are many in Syria, meaning?
Yes, سليمان, your idea is clear. سليمان Krou, we heard from Syria, thank you very much for being with us. Naif Al-Sa'eed from Kuwait, please.
Peace be upon you and blessings of Allah.
And peace be upon you.
Good evening.
Good evening. Please.
I, please, I am disabled intellectually and mentally.
Listen, Arabs say that the heat understands through gestures.
And what is in Gran, he says, “In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.” Praise be to God, who has given us speech and given speech to all things.
That means I sat for more than thirty years, maybe I didn't speak at all, maybe just one or two words a day.
And glory be to God, God has given me speech.
It means he was talking in English, and I found it, you know.
It means that I launched an attack on me by exploiting the Quran and I am a hypocrite and I intend to target people and so on.
They glorify me and seek me, and I am in the lowest level of hellfire.
I only found defamation.
And they do not devour the *ghayghah*.
He who lives in a house of glass does not throw stones at people.
And disabilities, of course, self-made.
It falls within this definition: the question, Sheikh Suleiman’s question regarding
United Nations programs or their responses regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or others
Orientation to various organizations and agencies
For discussion and persuasion and to know what degree
There are issues and concerns related to disability on her work agendas, meaning
UNESCO is an international organization, the International Labour Organization, and UNICEF, and the reality of these organizations is that they create obstacles.
It is one of the programs that tries not to ignore children with disabilities.
Suitable opportunities and schools
From different environmental and aspects.
Similarly, UNICEF
But there are deficiencies that we must acknowledge, there are deficiencies in the United Nations as well.
Highlight the weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned, what are they?
Regarding the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
Directly, I was present in my country, in the state of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered
I sometimes find it particularly practical, I noticed it during also restrictions or shortcomings.
People with disabilities fight and struggle to have their disabilities recognized.
Until I reached a point where it was considered a disabled person's issue in some way, I didn't put it in a separate section as the Global Movement on Disability wanted.
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them.
This is one of the main shortcomings she has.
The assessment carried out by the special rapporteur and applied to countries
The staff and the workers in those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from eighty-four organizations and agencies. Only three responses came to us.
Do not place
A permanent and stable and continuous disability for many years, despite the fact that this disability is a human rights issue to the highest degree.
In recent times, Alhamdulillah, for the past two or three years.
The disability issue has become at least raised through events such as seminars and so on.
Hello everyone
My dearest lady, why are there no binding laws and decisions regarding Arab countries, and who is responsible for activating these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and allocating salaries, for example, allocating a salary for people with disabilities
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
And do these funds go to governments, or to offices belonging to the United Nations? And do these aid actually reach the disabled?
And, as a final note, there were no binding decisions regarding the Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Al-Habri, for talking to us from Greece.
Meaning Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, please Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
This proposal adopts
Write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Transformation of this box
And a factory producing
It allocates only one in a hundred of the annual net profit.
Returning to our guest to answer callers' questions
And he says that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery but
It costs too much and cannot afford to handle this operation, and it doesn’t know which way to turn.
He is from Algeria.
I believe it’s important to be responsive to the needs of brother Nagy.
Like any other rights, such as the rights of disabled people.
All of these are his rights and duties, and he must obtain them as a citizen.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal agreement.
And satisfying the rights and needs of people within their national scope
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
Mandatory for all countries and there should be oversight to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of senior officials, there must be awareness.
But at least, if we work on these agreements in this way…
Even if there is no significant commitment.
There has been a response to the reports regarding the monitoring you are doing, and was there interest
But don't forget that the ethical standard is a binding document, a matter of truth, not of law.
To be committed and approved.
And we understand that these chapters will solve or discuss or raise within a context encompassing many problems and issues.
Naji Zakarni, Director of the Qatar Deaf Center, is a sign language expert for Al Jazeera.
At the beginning, Mr. Ali starts by expressing his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera channel.
She's here, and she's now broadcasting this special episode.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a maid for all people with special needs, and she still is.
And we support her and stand by her always and forever.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them don't know this agreement because there weren't any training courses.
Specifically, and especially if it is in schools, hospitals, or government and private institutions.
It is necessary to publish this agreement.
It is a law that concerns people with disabilities in all countries of the world.
This confirms and goes beyond that the countries should
This agreement will be drafted and signed.
A model like also, such as Qatar and some countries have signed this document, with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, colleague ناجي زكرنا. I spoke on behalf of علي.
Thank you very much.
Your opinion can make a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability may begin with the proposal submitted by Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
About creating a support fund
It is a donation box and accepts any contributions from countries.
This box assumes that expenses will be incurred from it for activities that even the private tutor will undertake when he practices.
And even Arab countries have only offered one donation, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those commitments is a problem that exists in the United Nations.
The box that
Due to the non-compliance of major countries and lack of attention, unfortunately.
Many unfortunately say this with all the meaning of their recklessness that we don't care about the situation now.
It is a matter of commitments.
With human rights
The human in its general wide shape
Marginalized
But there are those documents for that reason.
If these countries fulfilled their commitments, but the idea that the brother launched is good.
It is absolutely necessary that there is not only an independent box, meaning a structured one, but also that the organizations already present in the area
What does she have in budgets
Step for projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for people with disabilities
This issue always overlaps, meaning political factors intervene in it.
His country or government provided him with significant support.
Unfortunately, the number has decreased.
With symbolic amounts
My father has a disability.
Of course, I withdrew from him sexually.
The girl withdrew to the girl who was her age.
I sometimes
Problems in teaching
We travel or go out, it catches us with confusion.
Peace be upon you and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you.
And I can
Rebuilding themselves, knowing
I hope that Arab countries allocate a portion of their budgets
Thank you very much, Behjat. Crowan Behjat from Kuwait
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, would you like?
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikh Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In the past years
With our best wishes, the residents of the special needs center
In her continuous support for them
A noble bearer of the standard from Tunisia, welcome to you.
And there is another level, the genetic one.
Believes that care for the genetic level reduces the rates of disabled people.
There are customs in Arab culture where a man takes his cousin's daughter, his cousin's cousin's daughter, and other female relatives as wives, and so on.
For this means in this level, which is a level of disability, and thank you.
Comment and what came in what came, and viewers' communications
The truth is, as I said at the national level.
Please be aware that there are guidance and support programs.
It is included in health services
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
The psychological clinic includes programs within the Council of Higher Education, as well as programs in education.
The private education department, I honestly don't know if it still exists.
But certainly, it’s within the health services, yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And for these cases, he was qualified to proceed.
Prevention is better than cure. He also pointed out the genetic factor of marrying relatives. Is there a campaign
For awareness
In this field
Absolutely, this is a very important and critical point.
And it’s the only matter that I and many others have discussed extensively in many articles and posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not just targeted.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
As for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries and Qatar among them
And certainly Tunisia
There are currently decisions requiring early screening.
and which was applied in many countries
All of this is precautionary.
And did you receive a response to such campaigns?
Positivity, especially when it clashes with habits and traditions
Of course, it's this, it's the difficulty that it clashes with culture and society.
If there is a decision to be in strategies to be in will to confront it and bind it
The issue of early screening, for example, is a very important issue before marriage.
I am asking if there are any statistics about people with disabilities.
Especially with people with disabilities in the Arab region
Qays in the Arab region, meaning that
And especially
With the recent events in the area
In regions and in conflict zones, wars are relative to wars and conflicts and other things.
Each killed person is met with three disabled people.
Events in Lebanon in Darfur in many areas
No way, it's not enough. First, the issue is...
With human rights principles
There must be a place for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Includes the items that already exist within ministries, institutions, organizations, both governmental and non-governmental.
And in circumstances like those of wars or disturbances
Only for your mandate as the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and even stranger than that, is what she said to the International Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that the demographic statistics
People with disabilities do not fall within the general statistics conducted for the population to this extent.
He doesn't always announce.
For example, in the state of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I believe it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior and the Planning Council
The Council has prepared this as a reality and with our participation as an office for the designated person.
It should be placed more placement of disability categories
The needs that are assumed to be present with me
The type of those all these important details that you absolutely need to reach a result
Is there a disabled person or not?
Completely, but at least.
Somewhat the statistics are advancing in this regard.
Peace be upon you.
My dear, thank you for this program and thank you, Sheikhah Hassa.
But Ahmed thanked God and praised Him for being Qatari and receiving this attention from my country, you know.
My daughter is a student at independent schools and receives good education, praise be to God.
And I want to thank Mrs. Hassa.
And its role is motivation, and its role that makes us not to be afraid or worried about our children.
Praise be to God, and abundant thanks to her, and to those who have not, and to those who support this category.
Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al-Duwairi, for talking to us from Qatar. Let's stay in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
My dear friend, the reality and the beloved one we are waiting for to resolve the problem of our stateless children.
Where is the Sheikh's daughter of our Qatari children?
I hope she responds to it, responds to this question.
Peace be upon you.
And I bear witness to the services Qatar provided specifically to people with hearing impairments.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss
There is the Supreme Council for Persons with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability
Even the Community-Based Civil Society Association AMG Oz and other communities
The reality and the Almighty, if compared over five years
What was offered to people with disabilities five years ago and
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem, for talking to us from Jordan and returning to our land.
Of course, the
The community as a whole, and especially families that have
Children have disabilities and have great ambitions and expectations from any
Whether it’s at the strategic level or the executive level
But regarding one of the points that was mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who do not have documents or anything else, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international agreement is like many international documents.
And commitment to translating it into plans and strategies
It offers those services automatically.
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion or race or color or sex or nationality
Well, Sheikh Hassa, I mean, I was a special advisor previously, I worked with the United Nations concerned with disability for six years.
You were wishing.
Perhaps time wasn't on your side, or perhaps financial assistance wasn't enough.
There have been many achievements accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, or through the organizations currently existing, and through the institutions of governments in many countries.
In the Arab world specifically, focus.
To have more research and larger studies
Let's launch from a global scan that has revealed more than one report from us.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on constantly and significantly.
Coordination among Arab countries
Tell the people themselves, the people with disabilities, and their organizations, because they are
But upon them is a duty that must be.
They are struggling for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, in conclusion to this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinion and feedback with us.
Tomorrow, Insha’Allah, we will meet with a new guest.
Stay with us through your calls and messages in a new episode of Direct with Until next time.
Good morning.
I am very happy to have you with us.
To begin, before we start asking the different questions and chat this morning
Thank you, Shima, I might be here.
The Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar really put us on the map of the world.
Thank you Qatar
Also, please be seated, Mr. Ali.
First, I became for the viewers of the brothers.
And I told him congratulations on being invited, and to all the people of Qatar.
And God willing, just like Sheikh Muhammad said.
Before a dream and now, inshallah, it will be a reality and work will begin from today or from the announcement period.
I was expecting you to have hosted the World Cup in 2022.
Despite the existence of strong files, like America, Japan, and Australia, I wasn't afraid in this field regarding this specific topic.
Don't look, I'm being completely honest with you, 70 percent of my life is chosen
Our file is very much.
Views are global and competitive charts.
We were, you know, in competition.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar’s file was indeed strong and deserved it.
It is correct that the file "2022 and the World Cup and its hosting in Qatar"
What does he mean by that in the Ta'zieh (narratives) themselves?
They will definitely be very, very happy, God willing.
I like that. We used to talk about music, but I wanted to listen to music like that.
In the moment of the announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the joy? How was the shock? I don't know, just tell me, tell me. You speak to us and you speak to the viewers.
The radio
Behind the world, everyone is with us.
Draw the advertisement and high.
How did you see the global media?
Check across all sports channels, everyone has insisted, especially the Arab countries – thank God, everyone has supported it.
Simply declaring Qatar’s victory is enough to assert its right to host.
All Arab countries, and none are foreign to this noble gesture, have announced their readiness to offer Qatar whatever it needs.
Declaratory from human resources, we can volunteer starting out.
Even at the level of external media, Shaima
I and Wa'ta went to celebrate a bad situation.
They included them in the photos from the agency, just as the French news agency also photographed.
We also have meetings
It's like nobody insisted, the diameter became fine, let me be first every day, I'm remembering it.
Hundreds of times a day, on a smallest piece of land, for the largest piece of land.
I I expect everyone will know Qatar that doesn't know Qatar on the ground is now over the internet.
Owner of the 2002 World Cup
Any football player dreams of serving his country and being part of the national team.
Of course, definitely any player, whether in the Qatari League, wants to represent the national team.
This means something positive that a person would kill themselves even in matches.
If the coach succeeds and gets into the team, he’ll put everything he has into it.
It means whether it's in training or in the matches, because the national team's emblem is on his chest, so I have to put everything he has.
"And God willing, the officials didn't fail. Whether it was in attention to the players, especially the young ones, that's what they're teaching them – professionalism from a young age."
Eating Sleeping
Tell me about your experience playing in more than different stages throughout the year. How was your experience, and where was it most important to you?
And of course,
Players from the youth squads were included in the first team's selection.
Do you know about the camps with the clubs, with the club, with the national team?
Each stage has its own character.
Yes, Lana, Mashallah, meaning you were like, you were moving around.
We are now completely used to you, Al-Lana Sports.
We always see you like this, sports fan. We want to get information from you and know the sports news through Lana. So, what's the sports news with you?
I mean, honestly, I don't really watch much variety shows, you know? With variety shows, we used to invite celebrities from different fields, and we also invite stars in sports.
Like Ali and others in their field of sports.
Conversely, physical activity
What's up with us being the sports capital?
Qatar and we have become the capital of sports and world football.
Instead of you not being in variety shows presenting affordable cultural programs
You have different fields, such as volleyball, different championships.
But then sports
Sweet excellent
I wished for justice.
I wish I was five twenty years old, I wish I was ten years old.
And I believe that the youth players have a great opportunity and many opportunities.
They hold onto her, meaning as they say with their hands.
It would be great if you could tell me the word you want to address the players with, hopefully.
Inshallah, meaning I will have the young ones who will have a bright future, by God's will, in the coming days.
Of course, this is a great opportunity and we really need to take advantage of it, you know.
It means "these are golden opportunities," they say.
They should exploit it to a great extent.
What's new? What's up? What's new now with the programs I'm going to suggest? I know we brought them back from vacation.
Please tell us about your new projects, God willing.
In constant contact with the event, hopefully we will attend Asian Cup qualifiers in one month.
We finished two days ago, but regarding the Gulf Cup, we congratulate the Kuwaiti national team.
The news is also published, meaning that with intuition, we monitor intuition.
Absolutely, as a fundamental thing, Al Jazeera television – meaning its first appearance to the viewers was through the Qatari screen.
We have denied this well-known matter definitively.
And praise be to God, they are broadcasting the public service message on various channels.
If it is private channels or sports channels or other channels
Thank you, Qatar TV.
We are definitely hoping for your success, God willing, and we are still on this topic.
First, I want to thank the administration of Al Wakrah Club for and
And the fans of Al-Wakrah Club are
As a child while in the homeland
An elder was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club
I am Layhin, son of the people of Iraq and son of the people of Iraq.
But, like I told you before, this professional program.
It concerns every individual on the land of Qatar.
The youth are finished, we know that the youth love sports and are addicted like that.
How can we incorporate physical activity into the immersive experience?
Raising media awareness at the highest level means that the media has a very important role to play in publishing sports in various magazines. Let's discuss life.
The youth are addicted to the internet, but currently, sports are starting to enter schools; sports awareness is becoming a priority in schools.
At events, what kind of sporting event do they celebrate?
You have the Qatar Street, meaning we see banners as we walk along the signs in the streets as well. This is considered sports awareness.
The female element, whatever specialty it is, such as a place in the stands or anywhere.
This is also a women's awareness campaign, or let's announce a female sports event for female participation in the sports field.
Then we became a Qatar national team for female players.
I imagined that sports have started to expand, الحمد لله.
I also expect Lana that the time period
To do many and bigger awareness projects about the topic of sports, and I think this period is enough.
If you study correctly and work correctly
Hey, enough! And from the same team, we need to utilize it properly like she does.
Then in Nuata, I wanted to take advantage of what is how the younger generations can benefit from the national team.
All capabilities and expertise of devices are available.
Also, there’s an important thing that, thanks be to God, we are known in Qatar in this regard to a large extent among the Gulf and Arab communities, as they love generosity greatly.
How can I attract this audience to follow sports news permanently on Al about matches happening in Qatar?
And at the same time
Seriously, most of the Qatari street loves Al-Rayyan, they love football, but the problem is attendance.
If you enter forums, you'll find a lot of attention, especially in forums related to certain clubs or clubs, most of which
Great interest in the football league.
You as a player, you as a Qatari citizen, what solution do you feel might attract you to participate, to be Qatari, to be a player?
What's the way they can attend the matches? My friends, my circle.
It depends on the person themselves, you know, like how they think or something.
Some people like to watch me on television or, you know, gatherings they have.
For example, Japan has launched a major plan to attract a large audience to attend.
When you attend the matches with me collecting points, I don't know what it means. They are doing things to them at night, hopefully it will be resolved.
And in Arabic
The most important thing is that every player will hopefully be in Qatar, especially with the 2026 World Cup. What do you think we need?
It seems like you're saying that you don't support the financial assistance, and you think this issue is actually really important and you need it.
And providing the means that can be prepared for the generation to truly be worthy of the Qatari national team’s name and participate in a World Cup, the World Cup.
The time when he told me now, the bad feeling is ending. When it was in my heart, a sentence I kept saying, when? Mashallah, the time has passed quickly with the lovely ones.
Overcoming the impossible and realizing the dream we thought was impossible, but praise be to God, we are living now in reality.
Just like Sheikh Mohammed, these are moments of celebration, but the work has begun.
God willing, the year 2022 will be a worthy event for Qatar.
I congratulate everyone on the land of Qatar and say to them frankly that now Qatar has become a landmark of the world.
Inviting two hundred and twenty-one
And thank you to the elegant media Lana Al-Adayi, we wish everyone all the best, God willing, and we will always follow you to benefit from the advice.
Thank you so much, definitely. The happiness in the Princess’s eyes.
Qatari talents
And they are singing a new song from the songs that are appearing during this period.
But in the format found on a music and fast rhythm website
And also a group of his rap fans, God willing.
Hello viewers, and we begin our journey from this moment, and good morning.
We're casting a look at it.
In short, we can define rap as a fast lyrical music.
The performer alternates between hesitation and doesn't sing a fast, rhythmic lyrics for the song.
Composed of a large number of rhymes, it addresses a variety of topics and issues.
and which may be personal sometimes
A deeply emotional and political gathering
And it is often arousing controversy.
and largely free
And the rapper is our viewers who don't sing the song's lyrics.
He repeats it.
And his voice is beautiful, a secondary factor.
Generally, the voice isn't important in rap songs.
And that’s why he’s not called a singer but a rap performer or rapper.
And the rapper cares about the following element in the songs
Such as: Simultaneous flow convergence such as or projection
Oh, we are following each other, we are following our audience, we are following our lovers.
They have a certain style specific to rap.
And I expect they'll give you a better and better idea than I do, personally.
Good morning, hello.
Honestly, first of all, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
We are distinguished by
We are here, so why aren't we rapping?
Then rap music, which is an art form, exists in every country in the world.
Why isn't it in the list?
We said, meaning we're going to invent something new.
It means we give him an idea about it through a message.
In this, I’m talking about the negatives and positives that happen in our society.
We'll send a message first, second, it's like a shroud, you know.
This is an art form unlike any other, and by the way, this information may have addressed many social and psychological problems among young people significantly.
All the time I expect it to change, and this with the passage of time I expect.
And God, he was a little weak.
We sang from 2005 to 2010 about the Tgbel. He was weak at the beginning.
Let us say for ourselves that the new beginning for us is the year two thousand and ten
in popularity and widespread
She likes to try and sing and follow the same rap style during this period. I noticed that thing.
Yeah, definitely a large percentage after people
Also, there's something we need to talk about regarding EA in a few teams.
Beautiful squad, come on, you've been through this, maybe we can talk about this squad.
How was it founded and what was the idea behind it? Really, anyone can form a band, and how many of you are there in it?
And Allah is in the beginning, you know, before the band was formed.
The rap arrived in Doha, so it started in 2005.
It means that everyone loves the idea of rap, so he sings rap, he used to sing, he uploads it to the website.
I am downloading Salman, I am downloading someone else, I am downloading and there is competition.
And we met people
So, we're now competing with each other.
Then, after a while, after like, after all these years, we reached the year 2010.
In 2010, there was a system of groups, meaning this is a group in itself, with three or four people together.
So basically, we said why it's over, why not unite that we're all one group called Rappers.
O Balan Lizzy Q Wrappers
And we agreed on this, you know? We said it with one name, we're all one hand in each other's hands.
And so we realized, like, how we represent this thing and say this idea, you know?
Approximately five and twenty people
Five twenty-two wow, may God be pleased, a large collection
Well, does anyone play or or or everyone performs rap songs.
And he is the one who arranges and he is the one who composes.
It means you can say something personal.
How are the numbers arranged in the group? Excellent, how are the five and twenty arranged?
Each person has their own potential.
Each person from the band can make a complete song.
Without relying on anyone else.
But there, the competencies might vary, for example, like if Salman is better than me.
He hears her saying no, just and fair words, nothing more.
Could each one adjust for the second?
Help me a little.
Even if there is an official side that adopts these works, or even if there is a company, for example, that follows you.
And there are distributors who are right.
So it means that the work should appear in a style like this, elegant and really have something formal for you.
And Allah, we really wish, you know, we really wish for support, like, for it to reach us, that they say that a company builds and tells us, "Come on, we're going to release and produce an album for you."
We don't have a problem, you know.
Things are a bit difficult.
Therefore, why don't you think of it as a first initiative?
Even if one just gets to know the first CD
This could allow you to then attract partners later.
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed it, by God, to the youth.
How was the rush?
And God is my witness.
Text text because in the year 2007 perhaps I roast rap what what is possible continuing strongly in the Gulf.
But it's not up to this moment now
We were always enemies, arguing about whether to look at the news, like for example, if you hear about a large group going from Valencia to Gijón, for instance.
Let's talk about it.
They told us we are organizing your party.
And it means they covered all the costs and all the procedures, and the coordination meant and the work meant, honestly, we didn't expect it to be at this level.
It caused an explosion, honestly, and it was amazing work.
And it was just a little bit of pressure, you know, there weren't any ads, there wasn't anything, like, at the event.
There wasn't anything in the ads, there wasn't anything before the party two days ago.
We said, like, nobody was coming, like, a party two days before the announcement, nobody was coming.
As we were entering, like, before the party started.
This means this is a point in our favor.
So, basically, it means that our voices reach the families, not the youth.
Our view is that we expected the idea to be just this one belonging to the youth.
We discovered in this stage that there is a group, actually more than a group, that listens to us.
In a certain song where there was a big interaction with the audience and the band
And most of the songs had interaction.
I don't really like most songs, but the songs were a lot and we were a big group.
The group means the whole group.
What words are like this, how to deal with different issues?
We're talking about the situation we're in, but we're getting out of it fast.
Grill it at least, even if it's a lot.
Even if you spoke before, it would be me.
It's necessary to get out the sentences are random.
It means the rhyme comes out.
It means, when we critique, we think about it, we write this "yes" instead of writing this word, it's better.
Okay, so we have a song, let's check it out.
It’s one of the songs I did.
And we follow it and we also see the opinion of the public on this topic.
Hopefully, they also enjoy such words.
Thank you for the introduction, I liked it because it included the name of my program.
With me are Keidi and DJ Mister Bobo on Doha Morning Show
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
This is key guy Mister Bob and as key tie one to be free
And don't forget the program starts at 6:30 AM, meaning Every One is at the TV.
I am struggling to understand this text. It appears to
With the director Nasser Al-Maliki, episode of Qatar Beatz, definitely.
It actually does have the name Al Bashakhr, thank you guys, God bless you.
I'm going to tell you about the cars I'm driving for the youth upstairs in the control room.
Last night it was recorded
And who wrote the words in you, and who?
Each one writes his words himself.
If I go, I'll write words for Joseph.
Just writing these words about love for singing and love for emotion.
I expect you'll have to write in the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup. I expect you might be able to qualify for it, right or wrong?
We are definitely about ourselves, you know, definitely we're releasing a song about this topic.
But it has to be formal or this is for grilling, I mean
I expect there to be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of flow, the art of rap, it's true.
Yes, I expect that we all are waiting today.
We're seeing live right now.
And of course, this cup arrived and the streets of Doha are beautiful.
If our viewers, as we've seen, Doha is getting ready to welcome the Asian Cup
And the concerned devices have all the arrangements to be in reception.
The cup and the expectation is definitely there will be a bigger turnout than what we saw.
Before grilling, I expect the length of the promenade from the beginning to the end.
It is definitely important to welcome this important sporting event.
In upcoming parties, Inshallah, I will follow them on Al-Alima in the coming days, Inshallah.
It means that in our organization, we're going to organize a party for you.
But things are, you know, kind of complicated, a bit.
The procedures are not certain like this.
If we're trying to mean, for example, I saw Youssef and I saw someone else.
I saw so many people that I have a song about their fathers. I have a topic for a song.
Inappropriate song rights
The possibility that we can sing.
I am sitting at home.
And then Yusuf sent it to the email on the net.
To you, Joseph, this is a part of the song
Also a thing you travel abroad
People who have entered this field and have millions of fans.
We're not trying to offend, but people hear what's best.
Just be like, a strong competitor with his style.
What prevents me from taking ideas from them that I imitate in things
So, basically, you reverse it, take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song in a different way.
They created a special team and they have more than one CD with people.
About a person named Abdullah Al-Daiel
He has experience and the ability to discover groundwater.
and their ability to detect groundwater sources
One of the residents of Madinah
There are a lot of experienced people.
To determine water locations before drilling wells
And it may need to dig or many wells may be dug and there is no water.
Relying on his copper rods and pomegranate branches
And the fig, through which one can determine the locations of water.
What tools does he use?
Al-Mak Mak discovered groundwater.
This was old.
But now it has been replaced with brass versions.
Now the two sticks are connected parallel to each other.
Let's walk now with unhurried steps, a light walk.
We watch what we pass by a stream.
The Qazban door will open.
Now, now, we are now going through this way, we are flowing through a stream.
It opened like this.
When we cross, it starts now.
This is the center of the waterway
And and and and from here it becomes the midpoint
With this method, we can now determine the course of the water channel or the channel beneath the ground.
And the process was repeated many times in many locations until we found the strongest location.
Abu Ibrahim confirms
Achieving an advanced level in this profession
His discoveries were very precise.
In Marat and outside Marat in Shagra and in Akhirmeh and in Athitya
More than one hundred and fifty barrels were discovered.
His error rate was five percent, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and mastery from Allah, the Exalted.
Superior to devices and modern standards
In a record-breaking short time
Abdullah Al-Murshed
Doha Morning Program
Medina is located north west of Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh.
And we continue this report and we promise you, God willing, with other reports from Arab and international countries.
Hopefully, and inshallah.
We are now reaching our viewers on various platforms and addresses, but they all have meaning.
The large and first title and
If I expect there to be a large number of young Gulf people in the Gulf itself.
In certain people, you look up to.
But it means, for example, that you imitate them, but you listen and it's necessary to follow their work first, first.
And they are, the rappers of the Gulf, in general, connected to each other.
It means I'm not a competitor for competitions, you know? I released a song.
And I'm talking about the topic.
It means you're creating a competitor, as you say your goal is.
Let’s see if there’s a connection and it means just one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusay did so, Mashallah, he's great.
It became bigger and had a CD and he gained a following.
And it happened to him like this, more than a company that could adopt it.
I hope you reach this stage, perhaps surpassing this stage even further, God willing.
Insha’Allah, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this team.
It’s there, of course, and welcoming this important sports cup, the AFC Cup, let’s see the footage available on the boardwalk.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
Those who are moving from the West but with a Gulf style.
Emotional songs, rap songs, and unique bands of five twenty people
It is necessary for one to follow your news first and foremost.
I expect you to have an email, you should have a specific website or forum online.
How can one possibly reach you?
And Allah, we used to have a website about us a while ago.
But if there were some problems with the company, the staffing company.
He used to come sometimes, sometimes he didn't know what to do.
So, we faced problems there, and in the end, we just closed it.
Well, the site is definitely closed, it’s closed.
But what's the alternative currently, so I can solve this problem as a team.
In the UAE or Saudi Arabia or Bahrain or Oman or even in Morocco or Egypt
Everyone needs to communicate with you and find out about your news and see the songs you produce from time to time.
Faysh alternative now
Currently, alternatives are based on private pages, for example.
What is it called exactly?
It's your favorite from Atsewen Search, but on Google.
Bisma Rab Qatar or Rabrez Qatar
Videos were made for yourselves.
The program, you guys worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
Song and photos
Song and the same thing as a video, but I film in the back too
I expect we need to do this to see you develop more.
You need a place near you where everyone can have their own device at home.
The hammer, the computer, the piano, and the guitar.
Honestly, I really wish we could get some support.
Means, like, a company, like...
We produce CDs for you.
I'll make a special place for you.
From ourselves
But in the end, we remain, you know, with personal work.
We don't want it to be personal work.
By God, my words are no different from Joseph's words.
Video clip we need video clip
And the album
The power of dissemination with B in video clip I expect it to be very important
The information isn't reaching.
If support exists, everything is with it.
Your sweet voices reach everywhere.
It is considered one of the different arts that treat problems and treat appearances.
Thank you to Youssef Al-Naeemi and Salman Al-Abdullah for being with us.
I see it and wish it well, of course, all the best for our program, Qood for Youth.
These projects were great.
The project is also almost ready, but it needs some final technical development.
Expiration date, price
You've reached the cashier, you have the total, you have all the details and you're ready.
And knowing the product instead of picking up every detail and seeing its components and its flaws.
He was pushing the trolley.
Someone can create their own course, and they can choose the subject they want.
Of course, here’s the translation: Naturally, the projects often reflected the child’s feeling of a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center currently focuses on the programs it designs and events are based on a main concept.
And we have ten goals that Her Highness Sheikha Moza set at the founding of the Center
Could be, could be too.
He immediately goes down below, moves under the belly, gets down to the train under the ground from his house.
But her main idea is clothing.
Show me all the stores in Qatar that have black T-shirts.
I have the key to the house and the car key too, and a button I can press.
It shows me if a paragraph disappeared and I wanted the key for it.
Yes, we're going back to the projects that we will be undertaking, God willing, through the cultural center.
Early childhood education for children
And develop their skills and build the gifted.
So we are not a collection of children's skills, whether it's media-related or research-related.
If the skills of personal communication in addressing and persuading the audience
With the diversity of these skills, a specific program has been designed to serve them.
We have started announcing the future and we have accomplished a great deal in it, now we have reached graduation projects and their completion.
We have also reached a large number of young child preachers.
And their innovation
You have some small announcers too.
He returned to television, and it’s necessary that they present programs for children.
We're watching, we've counted everyone for television.
Through their television, Qatar television
They're counting on this, meaning we'll finish with them in eighteen years.
Welcome to them wherever they may be, yes.
This also means national television.
We need to attract and cultivate these talents and develop them.
From advertising to researcher
To specific interfaces for thinking
To reading, to many diverse fields
In your collaboration, you take ideas from each other.
In every field, for example, the program of the Promising Speaker with the Ministry of Religious Affairs
The lecturer is also a generation.
The Scientific Club and it played a significant role in developing projects and also providing technical support for those projects.
The most important role also of the Supreme Council of Education and their support for schools and their partnership.
Professor Abdullah, your transfer to Katara, this great edifice.
Anyone who also collects a large number of wonderful events and activities
Is this installment to the front of the center itself considered...?
Don't you take a separate building like that?
Far from this great edifice
And it gave us a user interface to deal with the public more easily, meaning.
And pioneering and good projects as well.
And in many cases, welcoming guests and introducing them to the nature of the programs that offer cultural programs for children
Because our project is our main focus for the next three years.
The National Project for Developing Children's Reading
Under the Patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with very significant support.
This is a major project, which is the development of reading and writing children's stories to develop their skills.
The cultural diversity that refers to reading in particular
There are many programs, of course.
Now we have recently moved.
And I now mean reordering the with each, meaning the activities
And its design and development so that it suits the nature of its visitors, Katara means
We are definitely wishing you all the best, God willing, through this center.
Anyone who contains very important ideas
Of course. Firstly, we thank you for this wonderful hospitality.
The most important thing, honestly, is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children are
Today's children are not like yesterday's children; their childhood is different from our childhood.
They need us to give them more attention and focus and time.
Give him sufficient listening to his attention and his imagination.
And I communicate with him mentally.
They work like that, their way of dealing with children is like a hotel where they provide accommodation.
It is a bank of Ioffer giving me the money.
It is lacking a child who doesn't have someone to listen to these ideas, listens to, to this imagination.
We really did move them recently, during the past few days, to twenty thirty.
Through this decree
Wishing you all the best, Inshallah, for the projects that won awards.
And thank you for attending with us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jameeli, Director of the Child Cultural Center, and we wish you all the best, Inshallah.
Even these projects actually happen and exist in reality, and aren't just a dream all the time.
Welcome, our viewers, the Child Cultural Center concluded last Monday evening at the Diplomatic Club
Activities of the National Council for the Dreams of Generations under the slogan: Dreams of Generations, Facts of Tomorrow's Nation
It was organized to commemorate the National Day of the country, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
The audience witnessed various events and different competitions.
And innovative projects for children
Generally, we are pleased to introduce you, our esteemed viewers, the appointment of Mr. Abdullah Al-Jameeli, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning. May God preserve you, my dear sister.
To start, thank you for making time for the center
Regarding this remarkable phenomenon
We are also pleased to have you with us through the program to cover as many events as possible that took place through this exhibition.
This national monument of generations' dreams
Praise be to God. Of course, this is a statement.
Contribution of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate National Day
And he had a stance, of course, it was very important to him to have a very important touch with every child.
Aiming to empower children
I won't live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's dreams are vast.
Her fields are wide, we defined them in the context of Qatar twenty thirty.
And other main fields for vision Qatar twenty thirty
We started training children in four stages.
And how are the mechanisms of brainstorming and the mechanisms of a set of tools in expanding the child's field of thinking
What do you mean by that sentence specifically?
These are facts of tomorrow’s nation
This means that what our children dream of today.
This project grows with this project.
That was a truth, you know – an interpretation of this for this vision that children start living from this day.
I have a big dream
If it is an environmental field or a field, for example, in the field of health and human development, and other fields
Which serves the homeland
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place
Or in a specific performance
Is everything that was there existing through
The governor had honored guests for the governor.
Ziyouf al-sharaf huma al-qidam hatta yata'allam minhum al-atfal kaqawadat.
Yesterday's Arab Autumn, about two or three weeks ago
And he was also among the winners in various awards and prizes in the Arab world.
There was a table listing their projects.
Yes, and the pictures definitely, meaning witness to your words, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were available at the gallery and various events.
This is also the owner of the last project, the owner of the forest.
innovative or creative
This is one of the children's innovations, Mashallah. It’s a really beautiful idea, and we can really enjoy it for the viewers.
We talk about it slowly. What exactly is this topic? The colorful ball.
Almost four or five projects talked about this topic, one of them was about hate speech.
Or Ismene is also the Smart Stadium.
This ball, if it gets out of the field
It changes its color.
We'll have this happening a lot in matches in the future, hopefully.
What comes after these dreams, anyway?
It also relates to a need, meaning he is interested in it.
And I expect that, especially when they are responsible, they take into consideration these small projects from young minds.
But we don't know if these projects perhaps really serve us well, the president of the football union here in Qatar.
What is our opinion? What do you think about the world?
Do you love the idea?
He was alone and the price of his visit, of course, and he stood on the projects that were dedicated to football.
Road closure and these projects were built at that time.
He was the head of the event at that moment and adopted these projects.
The public also voted for a large number of projects that our children submitted.
Hey guys, what projects can we say had a big spotlight and were highlighted?
Of course, we have a committee with a primary evaluation method.
These projects are the ones that won awards – the first, second, and third projects.
He came from the wilderness and won first prize.
He had very detailed information about the project, and the project was ready to start.
In addition to the administrative side, of course, there are many administrative aspects needed.
I delved into the incredibly detailed and distributed details of the visitor brochure as well, meaning she was completely prepared for her project.
This is definitely the pictures we're seeing.
This is a set of yes, this is also a collection of many projects I participated in.
Maybe they feel that way, like they're just following movies or cartoons.
It is not directly linked, but it may be realized in part, adopted by institutions.
Like, we give names to projects. What are these projects?
How can this surplus be utilized at home? How to spend it, accumulate and reuse?
Mitten seventy-four students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and seventy-four students from the 33rd batch.
Dr. Khaled bin Mohammed Al-Athaye Minister of State for International Cooperation was delighted.
And a large number of parents and members of the teaching staff
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
Of course, let me translate that for you. We would like to thank colleague Salman Al-Majed, and we will continue in the same artistic atmosphere. Today we have a special guest with us.
From my family, a series of classifications of the artist Abdel Hamid Al-Shershni.
Who confirmed his attendance with numerous works, including the series "Rental Hearts".
And they tired themselves in proving themselves on the artistic scene.
Especially since the realm of art doesn't tolerate flattery
that means
Welcome, and good morning. I love to wake up my viewers.
Actually, the program is secure, honestly and
I’m going to see a very simple piece of one of your works and we’ll start a conversation with you.
I'm laughing at Ana
Take the fake thobe and bring the original.
Soul and go.
The kandura is available.
What happened to this suit? How do I return it?
She ground the dust in her belly, her father's dust.
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
In the Supreme Committee of the Conference
I don't agree with you.
I don't mind.
If this is a quick clip, it's a simple segment from a series that I'm going to watch the second part of.
I ask you about your participation this year in part two.
Tell me about your roles in this series of classification episodes, where each episode has a different topic.
What are you sharing about it?
Of course, after...
That era has long passed.
And these places are also famous for mountains.
The poem that poets have long sung praises of throughout time
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities
And it refers to Iraq's past.
Located 173 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And it was said that he was related to Amra al-Qays al-Tamimi.
It was distinguished by its beaches, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
Poets have sung of her, and they have been captivated by her, and her fame is associated with her well-known mountain, Lake Kummīt.
It is said that the Kummiah Spring
Of course. Here’s the translation: Naturally, Medina was often referred to as “Medina Zarba” in the past.
And the appearance of Islam had preceded it.
There were ancient things that were not known for their history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
That is the situation we are currently in.
The Companion Khalid bin al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) was ordered by the Prophet (peace be upon him) while passing through the campaign against the Ridda (apostasy) to dig this well.
And I have remained until this day.
The saying goes: "Promise me a full cup, promise me many refills."
If you see a quantity, you see times.
Of course, another of the effects is the Kummiah spring.
The well from which the sweet water has flowed repeatedly over the years
What was enough for the city for an entire year
From the beginning of the rainfall until the next rainy season
The origin of this impact is unknown, and its date of creation is not known.
Also there is the bride and there is
Mount Qamiet is one of the landmarks of the city of Marat.
This mountain is said to have many proverbs, poems, and verses.
Where it comes to him from all parts of the kingdom
Among its most prominent landmarks is Bir al-Walid well.
That is because he descended during the days of the Arab Revolt and was heading towards the Yamama.
He set up camp there and ordered men to dig this well.
Which water is still drawn from it until now, and they purify themselves with it?
Al-Qalqashani mentioned in his *ʿIjam al-buldan* that Khalid passed through several stations.
It is an old clay house that has been restored to its original state.
It contains numerous sections highlighting the regional architectural character and its fame for its heritage and remains.
He said about the poet, and when we arrived at the water, it was a maddened water.
The Well of Kumat is not the Well of Anaghil.
Mr. Ayman also, may God bless him, there is indeed cooperation between the family and the guardian and the guardian with this center and the child as well.
And I expect there are different ways that might be with you step by step.
For the general management of the training process
It means from the moment a trainee or a student or a child and Ivar comes.
This file will contain complete personal data.
Even his levels are updated every month, so we mean, like, every month there's an update.
It means a small program called "Gugol".
Every four lectures there is a clarification.
Through a username and password, the guardian can
We're giving it to him so he can log in
Yes, he sees, meaning the extent of his level he has reached from the beginning of his enrollment in this center until today.
Yes, we have these different models, and we will follow them up.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, it will definitely be an honor in a little while.
We're going to look at several different models. Could you please make sure we have enough space?
But we brought a model for a child.
There will be more than one test for you live on air.
We ask her math questions and different questions.
We're going to take a short break and then continue with you, and after that we'll see this smart little girl. Stay with us.
The manager of the artist is now smart.
It means any work being done from the beginning is not progressing, but the remote is working.
He wouldn't bother himself with twenty thousand other series.
Exactly twenty thousand series are correct.
Salsal as-sana means that and some people say no. One should focus on one thing.
Can he see the second projects?
What is what?
He says he only watches TV in Armazan.
Of course, we welcome your presence with Karim and Aziz Al-Sherini.
I love to address any word to the viewers, to your audience, of course, who love you. I am from your audience, definitely.
I am facing the word
I tell them happy new year to you all.
Seriously, we don't go out much, we don't go out a lot, we don't act much, based on your judgment, of course. I mentioned the reasons.
Next best
Insha'Allah, I wish you luck in your endeavors this year.
Inshallah, I will be there for a second meeting so we can talk about these plays.
Everything is connected, some of it more than others.
And fashion shows witnessed a great turnout and are eagerly awaited by lovers of new models.
Welcome dear viewers from Doha morning, and we are with you through the air.
Today, definitely, we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students and pupils who have joined this center.
This center offers a wide range of different sciences.
They are definitely focused on developing different abilities.
And also running their minds one hundred percent, God willing.
Professor, of course, we know him as Professor Ayman Khoghl, who is the Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning
Welcome.
And with a beautiful wish, a good morning wish.
Good morning.
How old are you, sweetheart?
Cargo ships ships
May God bless you. We wish you all the best.
What things do you offer to your sons and daughters?
It was clarified with Mr. Eiman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically a program that benefits our children.
And it is a program for mental mathematics.
Through the fenecres and through the apices
To reach with some specific goals, we tried to clarify a part of them simply.
I felt Professor Ibrahim sensed a real difference. The first student, upon entering the first two days.
And after you finish working with them for months, maybe three or four months.
If he were studying in public schools or private schools or even independent schools
Initially, the program is working scientifically according to certain methods.
After completing the first level of the program
Anyone who clarifies where the abilities the child lost or needs to develop can be reached in them.
And it has reached a certain limit, or what developments have happened with the child
We are going with a scientific approach, a scientific program.
It's not just some methods or mechanisms that are applied normally.
Scientifically and systematically
Before the program starts and after I have taken this course or the levels I have passed through.
Mr. Ibrahim is here with us, as you can see. Viewer Amina is requesting a scholarship from the students who joined this center.
We wanted this thing to happen today openly so that we could show our viewers the importance of this matter.
I'll come, I don't mind.
If this is a quick clip, it's a simple segment from a series that I'm going to watch the second part of.
But since we saw this clip from the first season of the series Tanif.
Tell me about your roles in this series of classification episodes, where each episode has a different topic.
He focused on that, that's what's going to happen.
Lost, remaining
She's been encouraging and she's offering opportunities.
Eighteen rings in categories of two
Of course, here's the translation: Naturally, a show director appears, a senior director appears, a baker appears.
Various dialects
Mr. Ghanem Al-Salihi from Qatar
From Qatar, we have artists.
Many artists aren't attending right now, of course. We have artists from Bahrain, Zahra Arfat, Batsma Abdullah.
We have
Faysal Rashid and Mohamed Adel
Of course, Tara.
Lula Yara didn't perform well.
Peak of business, we became in Qatar in the South in the year when you have two seasons.
Television also produces theatrical works, too.
Televizion Ghatir hi ta'ti muntaj manfath
The TV screen wasn't small, of course, but one project a year and all the Qatari actors want to work.
And this was the reason.
I need a single series and all the Qatari artists want to work in it.
Even if someone has a scene, they say thanks to God.
Praise be to God for all things.
Let's go back to your beginnings.
Thank you very much, of course.
Consult him about something.
Of course, the artist Abdulaziz Jassim has ruled over humanity to the last day and beyond dispersion, to yes and no.
In his plays, I work with him. It’s a theater production, and the first executed product was عبدالعزيز Jassim. We worked with him as theater and television.
He's the one who built us, he's the one who taught us, he's the one who made us.
Of course, here’s the translation: Naturally, after Mr. Ghanem’s talk about worldly matters, he really helped us with the lawsuit regarding Faiz Al-Tush in 2000.
Honestly, it gave us opportunities as young people.
They have between thirty and twenty-two projects a year.
We have two projects a year, thank you, thank you Tara.
Ghatl feeling, of course, is the same as Tara's production for technical production.
The show's director, Maher Al-Z
We returned to you our viewers and today about modern medicine reflection
Hand massage, palm massage
This treatment that has truly been practiced since ancient times.
We took our guest with us.
The method of inspection is as follows
Pain flare-ups
I feel a tingling sensation in my hand sometimes, like sand or like the veins spreading out inside my hand.
Put your hand
Of course, let’s translate that. Here’s the translation: “Well, my cousin is grilling, and he’s really stressed out.”
I'm feeling stressed about interest rates, I think.
On the left
Of course, let's translate that text into English: Naturally, my dear viewers, he is currently examining the left side of his body.
Because the icon is in the picture
It seems there's a health problem appearing now that we've identified the headache and the dizziness that comes with it.
Heh, what's up here
The problem
What is this problem? What exactly is the problem here?
Here are the pockets the ears
Do you have any procedures performed in the sinuses or a problem before?
He was doing an operation, but it was in the past.
Meat and its juices
I've gained weight without eating.
Do you have a left shoulder pain?
This is nerve-wracking, especially on a day when he’s being pushed to his limits.
For ten years I walked barefoot on the sea.
We know that when someone goes to the beach, they expect to empty their bladder.
Any uneven surface is not just the sea.
Negative energies can be reflected.
And maybe you realize that you were also hesitant towards me because you discovered these things through massage.
Definitely the most important people for children
The children, praise be to God, for our mothers. Focus with me.
I'm tired of the milk and the food that he uses.
Her child can reach it, she puts it there and the child automatically gets hurt.
Idelic sugar
Simple compression, praise be to God.
You find after a while that the child is happy. First, he gets hurt and he cries a little because of the pain here.
Then suddenly, by God's grace, you see the gas coming out.
What discoveries did Professor Abdulaziz make?
Less than the second problems now, joints and bones, headache and dizziness, obesity and heaviness.
Secondly, regarding the pain of the womb, or the menstrual pain, or pain during menstruation in general.
Focus on rocks or stones, or simply by clicking here you give commands, SubhanAllah, to the lower back and menstrual problems, how many of you?
Within seconds, by God, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
It was easy for her to give birth.
But here, or there, of course, or God knows.
If they tell you that, in the seventh or the ninth, that you are giving birth or in the ninth
On the sand
It means you can walk on sand, it's okay, but not on rocks.
Break seven fruits, the fruit is the best.
If dates are sufficient, God willing, without adding moisture to them.
As He says: I seek refuge in God from the evil of Satan, the Accursed. And discovering this is the Quran, of course.
God is helpless to make this wet date come as it is.
O Allah, to You alone do I ascribe thanks, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word “I.”
Jawad replies, "Jawad replies, a small core."
The delivery bed, and it's in the nursery, I forgot, she came to the delivery bed, holding the clamps.
And I notice even in private hospitals, an Asian woman comes.
Now, hopefully she isn't even doing this – it's a habit in East Asia.
Do you have it? It doesn't need to be.
Just the mobile phone
Collaborate with some means each one I give advice to every creature that hears me now.
Be diligent in giving charity and be mindful of others, you were created as servants of God then
For the service of people, this is the first thing. Second, I am not a cleric or a Sheikh, I am an ordinary person.
Dear Mr. Abdulaziz, I thank you for this nice meeting. Thank you, of course, for our guest who is with us.
Thank you so much. God willing, and good luck.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council for Public Health, will provide us with more details.
Good morning Sheikh
Let's start immediately with a look at these events.
The Truth: A program of healthy steps towards Qatar
It is a program if one of the components of the national strategy to address and combat obesity.
Four countries from the top ten most obese countries in the world are from the Gulf region.
We started at the Supreme Council for Health with a strategy, of course, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other entities in the fight against obesity.
Fear of its spread increasing and increasing, Fal soon.
And one of the programs to protect from obesity is Healthy Steps towards Qatar
Let's work on this competition together to make it an international competition.
The program is six weeks long.
Each week is different from the next week.
To raise awareness among students in seventh and eighth grade about the importance of health during this age.
Because, in their early years, they start to understand themselves.
So, the first week was about what your favorite fruit was.
Week 2 Walking
You have to walk, of course, and every time someone walks, they gain points.
It's a map of Qatar, and as people gather points, they progress, their school progresses, and they take steps forward – that's what it means.
He’s beating his rival, you know, among the students.
Week three, he's drinking water. He needs to drink sparkling water.
I'm saying I get used to drinking water that doesn't need a reason, a lot of fizzy water, every time I'm thirsty I take fizzy water. I don't drink water.
Then we have the fourth week of your favorite sport.
Some of them like the games that are in school.
We are looking for a sports game for him, he likes it.
In order for him to be okay, meaning he needs to exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that he needs to be careful about his son, that he eats a healthy meal.
And Al-Jazeera Academy for boys and girls so we can take
Of course, here’s the translation: “This is a sample of its success, hopefully we will increase the experiment in the coming years.”
The students are very happy, they don't know how to express their feelings; our activity is more intense.
Solna games, we enjoyed more with our colleagues.
The girls are saying our skin has improved, the acne is less.
Absolutely correct, it becomes conscious.
Fathers know about their sons.
And their classmates in the second rows are asking, "What's up?" meaning and they learn from them and their classmates and brothers.
And praise be to God, it has started to spread that there are many schools very excited to participate in next year, of course, meaning now.
Inshallah
Of course, the official sponsor was Qotel in supporting this
We had Inspire Zone, which presented sports competitions for students and awareness.
He is on the dining table, meaning
Praise be to God for many entities, meaning... meaning I mentioned some of them and perhaps I missed others.
But praise be to God, everyone participated with what they had.
Some of the brothers were holding competitions on Saturdays.
It was diverse.
We tried to make several types and let the largest number of people in.
He is the generation of the future, meaning
In order to experience this and spread it to the largest possible audience in Qatar.
So, I'm evaluating it for the first time, and there are some things that need to be adjusted, you know.
After its spread, الحمد لله, now and with pleasing results.
Inshallah, we're publishing it because there are people now demanding that they say why we weren't included.
He ate. Healthy eating will get you there. Don't worry, don't have a problem.
We're at an age when, if we start small, we'll achieve what we want by the time we're twenty or twenty-five.
You mentioned a set of titles every week, with a title
If we return, we will try to have our paragraph today be about the conclusion of the events.
And also, if we go back to remembering people we are in our program, there were more than one guest appearance.
We go back to repeat and return every week what information we wanted to reach the students.
Insha’Allah, my dear, first of all, for example, in the first week, the favorite fruit.
Of course, fruits as a whole are a portion about the benefits of fruits.
What is the benefit of fruits that contain vitamin C?
He himself starts to figure out what he likes in fruit, not all fruit are his enemies, you know.
That means he might develop a sensitivity to one type or two types, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week, people walk thinking it's just for the young and disabled, why do they walk?
I mean, as I get older, I walk.
Actually, you are walking because she is calming the mind and the brain, you know.
And a person relaxes by walking, meaning that their mind becomes clearer, you know.
You were leading them to walk to school.
They are all required to move, whether at school or at home.
And they score their points through schools.
They don't mean it daily, you know.
This was an event where people did a school girls march.
We want it like that, we want them to be creative, you know? They should have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and the teachers are coming up with new ideas. We don't want to give them ideas that they can build upon.
And each one had their skills in this point.
Of course, the third week I drink water. Obviously, we always try to drink them water so they don't get thirsty and crave it. He takes sparkling water.
Of course, this week's favorite sport.
We can only reach and support his favorite sport if we are able.
It burns with sports.
They love sports because he’s just playing them, he’s playing sports without even realizing it.
Since we spoke before, we will talk about the National Association of Multiple Sclerosis Patients
Let me welcome today’s guest to our show, and we’ll see you at the studio soon.
Welcome!
Welcome to this program with us.
And among these diseases is this illness, perhaps to many of us who haven't heard of it.
To start, as Egyptians say, let's dive right into the topic.
It is a chronic disease.
The nervous system in the human body suffers.
It affects people between the ages of twenty and forty.
This illness also has no known cure yet, and no known cause or reason for it yet.
Active people in society, usually the youth group, are affected.
Treatments for cancer patients to keep you away from evil and other diseases.
This condition is an inflammation of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.
And it is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body prefers to have a body nearby, a body like it.
The neuron is a
I'm trying to cover this electrical wire.
White blood cells are the first type of white blood cells that kill or dissolve the outer layer.
which leads to the failure of nerve signal transmission, or its weakening or distortion
It leads to paralysis far from you.
As of now, with the development of medicine and the advancement of medical science, Professor Abdulaziz, we have not yet found a solution for this disease.
Okay, here's the translation: Well, for the solution, we need to figure out how it comes about, basically.
Also, one must have precautions about this topic.
The direct cause means the nature of life is the nature of food circulation in the life.
