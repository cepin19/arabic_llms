I'm saying the words you don't want to understand, Saleh.
What problems did Saleh face? Did he open his stomach, open your mind, open the world, open around you, open among people? What is he doing in the world? What is he doing?
If they are my uncle's brothers
And he doesn't want to develop himself and develop those around him.
Sali, your head can't take it.
No no no no I have nothing to ask of you
And she walks on the road.
And two halves of dates pass by.
You are dead to me.
Eat or don't eat.
I ate.
Yes, man agreed.
I have no idea where he's living.
I want to be with him.
This is our chance, God willing. Our cars are old and their models fail.
Try, try, try with him a little while longer, and whoever respects you.
This is normal and well-known stuff.
The bull is only with those who don't have a personality.
I swear, he's scared.
I feel like my stomach is hurting, seriously.
The budget is under his control.
What is this project that it's holding?
Government project
Underneath and not visible
I have the right to take
You are feeling anxious in one ministry and anxious in another ministry.
Shut up, mom, I forgot.
A day in the stable
I mean, I am.
Consider myself a contributor with them.
It's not loading for me unless the project. Wow!
I have nothing.
That means I'm contributing too
We should all take it.
This government project
He's starting to understand your son, this bull.
I understand him.
Good luck to whoever steps on you.
This is a government project.
And this is your chance.
Like Kirk, he's always buzzing.
China is in front of you.
Take your piece and put it in your pocket.
The currency wasn't in his hiding place.
I heard him with my soul.
It says that the government projects are well-known.
And a third sucked.
His son, Salam
Going to Souq Waqif
One well is eighteen reals.
Put it in the budget
And eighty pounds each are illiterate.
They said we didn't do anything.
You’re stuck with him.
I seek refuge with God from Satan.
I just feel like his head is a little bit tilted.
Inshallah, Lord willing.
He's the head of the committee and has everything under his control.
The most important thing is don't forget us.
Yours quarter
We have to be together, you know.
This government project is an opportunity.
For sure, Ali.
We can’t do without you.
I need you to tell us, Ali.
Inshallah, everyone who is part of the project team.
This is definitely something.
Yesterday, my friends and I were hanging out and chatting.
We, from your side, you.
The members of the project committee are reassured.
Afraid of Saleh, the head of this committee.
They say that
Tell you, O Ali
And to reassure the group.
Seriously, man!
May God bless you with goodness, but you didn't tell me.
And don't forget, you lazy one.
No
Hopefully things will go well.
I agree with this.
Take it easy on me.
My mother, come with the rash and hugs.
it becomes
So, since you're with us in the department, you're contributing to the project too.
But the most important thing is that the issue is between us.
I'll grill you a Chinese bread and meat in front of you.
I need to eat.
Congratulations and blessings!
You are kidding
If I brush my hair like this every time
We won't finish.
In situations like this, we never finish.
Oh, I have a question to ask.
We are helping and assisting.
How do we take our share?
Seriously?
The best books on it
Then you know it's not just us who are taking it.
Everyone who contributed to the project is demanding recognition.
Why not?
No fear, O Saleh.
We are the ones who put together the budget.
And the land piece that he bought today and registered under his name.
Found her later.
He tells her not to buy it.
Where are you getting this from?
Something is bothering me today.
He tells me to call my brother when I'm drunk.
He has the best.
Tell your brother as fast as you can.
I see the second earth.
The dirtiest earth I bought yesterday for my mother.
They agreed to sell it.
He says, call him and tell him if he wants to register it under his name.
I want to echo it on my dress.
And our right
And we consider ourselves shareholders with him.
Even if we aren't contributing
A bite bigger than you can swallow with your soul.
Why are you depriving your brother and your mother?
I don't come to you anymore.
We, after contributing to the project, have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her
Is it true that yesterday, when Ya'a Sultan, I requested it and it was rejected?
But I didn't let him.
And it's a mistake if they don't allocate a budget to the project.
Phase one
You're no less than anyone else.
Supplying the committee member with
I’m listening to them talking on the phone
Let me bring in my cousins and uncles.
I know that this government project is a way out.
We don't want a fixed amount and go out.
Correspondent
If my brother Sultan wants to attend our meetings, he can
Members of the committee
Project budget
The requirement.
You’re welcome.
Please forgive me, may God protect you. Bless you.
Brother-in-law
Do you like this?
The project serves us.
Let's mention some
We distributed the tasks fairly.
You, Saleh
And I am skilled in working with bricks, cement, and tiles.
The rest of the things are electricity and he put me on hold for me.
Guys
Take your share.
"Wallahi, ana"
I'm saying I'm taking a fixed amount.
Sometimes I say
Leave it as a relative thing.
No problem, Saleh no problem.
Take what you want and the way you want.
The most important thing
We are after
Ikon fi hathi al-usbu'
Each person determines the amount they have in mind.
For example, it means
After yesterday, he burned his self.
I need another thousand increase.
Seriously, why?
What do you guys think?
I'm with you.
Even after the shareholders
Take your profits, do your work, you don't owe anyone anything.
Do you have a halal orphanage?
Louder, increase the budget, increase it.
You are so beautiful and wonderful, may God bless you.
How are you?
What is this this property of Abu's property you are?
Your Majesty
Oh, my lord, or may your brother be cursed.
It means that after, he is considered a contributor.
This is the last name.
Saudi is your friend, how many names should I put?
He says those names will anger them.
Okay, I'll put it in which group, percentage or the net amount?
Don't put it with the tararweh.
He told you to give him, meaning give him twenty thousand.
Oh, just.
Even in a note here, they are writing.
I am one of the sons of Farraj.
But this is Saud, he didn't exceed his list of عبدالعزيز.
We're all going into the first stage budget.
Jack, why don't you grow up?
What’s up, up, the list you sent me from my mother?
He calls me every two hours and adds people to his liking.
God may lengthen her life, but heh heh.
Look at my child
And she is sick and poor, poor thing.
The woman has nothing left.
Oh my God, look at you! You only have one left.
Tell him about grafting.
Just a moment, how much do you need?
Give me liver and lodging and a hospital.
It means 88,000 rials.
You are looking for a friend.
Just being with you is expensive.
Oh God, may God guide you, put her name on the list.
Hassina, ay ay, hassina, bint al-Hilal.
I'll give it to you from my pocket.
Check on her and tell him that after the second stage, there's nothing left.
eighty eight thousand
My son, the honest one, they are going to put new ribs on it.
Tell him tell him, let him increase after two thousand, I'll buy gifts for the girls.
I'm telling you two thousand.
Five Euros for me
Damn, girl from Ahl al-Hal
I can fail you in front of your friends.
It doesn't matter.
I am busy and have a lot of work.
I'll call you later, I'll call you later.
The ones who eat from the Chinese ones increased.
The infrastructure is resilient.
Don't forget me, please.
Write the number you want.
My mother came back.
You and your conscience
I am the president of the board.
And I'm saying you deserve a million.
They determine hatred starts the project.
And they are waiting, inshallah, for the payments to us to arrive first.
I want to know how many.
Once, they will give it to you all at once, or in installments.
This kind of candy is better than us.
In a round, just keep quiet, the committee is coming, we're waiting for them and they're speaking.
Ya Allah, said Ya Allah, Ya Allah, said, "You quiet down, that's what you mean, quiet down."
Seriously, you guys don't feel bad or anything?
If I heard one voice among you
To cut the tongue, cut.
Oh, let's gather everyone.
This is also after money, not exactly but like this.
Before was a time
Fifty million
What's up with that old oil, man?
In the end, you are the president.
We don't want a headache.
We rely on the budget.
Through your talk about the project, Mr. Saleh, we notice that it is vital and important as well.
Please forgive me, this is not just for this generation.
Yes yes
Tomorrow the first phase of the project will open.
We love, we thank you for your visit, and we congratulate you.
I extend my greetings.
In this occasion
United Nations
Where do you want us? Where do you want the project?
Man, where are we?
Please tell me what is going on.
How are you?
You ladies are just making excuses and the people are clapping for you.
We are at the official opening of Ashfiij.
Like, are you saying that you're going to the project now?
We are on the project.

I honestly have no idea what's going on.
Praise be to God, arrogance is bad.
I just want to know why they removed me.
But he stopped his car
I was surprised, honestly.
But when she told me
I haven't received anything.
I saw her with my soul and with her, a great strength.
Thank God, you're comfortable.
I’m going to come to your house and relax.
Why are you not letting anyone play with your mind, why are you not letting anyone think with you, oh, Lady Mineerah?
Oh, my Lord, praise you, Mineerah, you have brothers like Raashed, Sa’eed, and Saqoor.
They are investing in your share.
aku govi refshiti hashe
Her siblings don't give her riyals for her father's sake.
We don't understand these things.
This is a legitimate right.
This is a trust issue; you don't trust us.
My mother, how are you?
I didn't like what my brother Rashid said.
He goes and gets the jokes that they give him every three months.
Okay, this is mine.
Everyone is telling me.
You don't trust us.
Inheritance and money issues require careful consideration.
Why are you my dad, you haven't been comfortable lately.
You know what you do to people.
And this is what Salma is asking for, poor thing.
Who would believe she's a millionaire heiress?
He's her brothers.
Influs will destroy the world
But truth is truth and this is God’s law.
And then, you know.
We are setting up the company
We invest land, real estate, and money.
No problems, no headaches.

She's really beautiful.
Let's go see what's up.

My sister started to get a fever.
This is the deal.
She's planning to do some things for us.
Let's give her the money.
Falcon, you are worthy.
We need a solution, Ya Rashid.
In my head
What's up?
My share of my father’s inheritance
Those who donate to me every three months
Everything is known.

What's wrong with them investing with the money?
I'm searching, searching, searching, searching
After cream
What she needs is thinking.
They're adding more to it so she can be happy and quiet.
Your words are all justice.
Some people are giving me trouble on the train.
If I find their wives
The absorber sets shapes and colors
I cannot allow myself to live even half their life.
It's not permissible for halal from my father.
If you are performing the pilgrimage
This is yours.
Legally and legally
I feel like they are ignoring me and cutting me off.
I'm not comfortable with their way; I'm done with it.
"By God, my love, I don't know what's happening in this world."
My heart aches for you, my mother.
They don't know that there is an account and a punishment.
And indeed, Allah will reckon them for consuming illicit wealth.
And you, my dear, you're bringing up the issue of the courts to them.
I swear, they'll regret it.
The more we are, or the more the population increases?
That’s why I’m telling you, my mom.
Be gentle with her.
Everyone has a house that you say are skyscrapers.
I only want what’s mine.
My son is sick before I die.
Why would you pray for this poverty?
Ayyy, ya umm Salem
Piss yourself, motherfucker.
Don't go to their court proceedings.
It is not permissible to take it.
Do you know why?
In this moment
Macol has her right.
The accountant is asking.
You are the one who asks the accountant.
Respond to them

Definitely, this is its worm.
And your sister is good.
Catch a rule from them
A known and defined share.
He tells you to take 600 thousand and 60 thousand more.
May God forbid them.
Expect anything, Maryam.
Abou Company
Eight buildings
Non-residential buildings and houses
He says six hundred thousand, but.
And I expect you to concede.
No, Maryam.
Endure their cutting remarks and expect me to compromise? This is your battle.
You have the right to my father, you know everything about land and money, they don't matter to him.
But the company
You are a partner with them.
Now they're firing you from the company
I'm telling you, no one can stop me.
What are you looking at?
Abouk Company is
You're not seeing him, are you?
I'm telling you, let me go in.
This doesn't make sense.
He has his papers, I don't know what's happening.
He's the longest-tongued one of us, let's cut his tongue off, I say.
I'm sorry,
My brother Saad and Saqr are coming to my office to explain something, but I don't know what's going on.
Come on, let's go inside.

We are blocking.
This accountant Samir exists.

Leave them to God and He is more than enough for us, oh you young man.
May God curse those who are organizing it.
Do not give them respite.
I can do for Yameel Salman.
I don't want them in the courts.
I don't understand this page at all.
I'm sorry,
Hold on, Yo, Nas!
They're coming to us about the court case.
You're lying, you've left your bed, and the doctor is looking for you.
Come, Yasmine

Ittefaq means inshallah, Abdullah will be able to get this back from them.
It's Raad's friend, you know.
He's been knowing her for years.
Do you, Menira, donate?
Even Abdullah advised me.
Keep an eye on them.
You threaten them and me.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is going to say to me?
How much did people earn in the 80s?
Our courts are owned by people who live by the heart for two hundred years.
May Allah have mercy on her.
She used to say
The population has reached four hundred thousand.
The story takes ten years and escalated.
I need a contact so we can review the courts.
This is it.
Hey man, do they have it?
May God bless you, hopefully.
I'm friends with an old friend from school days.
This world isn't worth it.
I'm coming with you in good news.
You guys are amazing, Mashallah, from a well-known and large family.

O Allah, illuminate our hearts with that which is good for our religion and our world.
Listen, you.
You have another colleague besides my sister's heir.

I told her I’ll postpone it until tomorrow and I’ll go to her then.
This what
May God protect your tongue.
You told me to laugh.
You're going to court to file a complaint against us?
In order to receive your share of the inheritance.
She said
Your world has become sweeter.
Your world was remarkable
Why did I tell you off earlier tomorrow?
First, you go to deliver to the courthouse building, you stop your car in the parking lot.

I know you need the money.
But hopefully, I'll finalize the transaction this week, I expect.
How did they spend it for him the first time

I take it with me and you.
I’m out of the factory.
He will lose a large sum if the transaction is not completed today or if it is not signed.
If he went and the manager knew.
Well, let's go.
And if the manager asked about it.
I don't fear, we're just acting, but let it go, God forbids it's a shame.

In celebration of retirement
Wadle qahwe wa timire ya sala.
He keeps trying to get rid of me, my brother.
You look like you're glued to the internet, Uncle Saeed.
What's it to you?
The khnfroush is ready.
Ya ya inshallah from my eyes, goodbye.
The Khrouf was ready, waiting for me, oh my!
I’m finishing all the papers for you, God willing.
Your chance, take it today.
They told me their boss is traveling.
Why do I have this?
I don't even feel like moving.
Zain trash had
Jazi is officially considered free.
God bless you.
Now, he's finally finished with everything for his comfort.
You didn't miss a beat, Abdulaziz. Safe travels.
Bless me, Yahweh.
No work.
You're not connected to him.
For you, for your sake
Human Resources
Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.
Aki Zhero amsoowe halfa bimanasebet naja'e waldaha.
I bring you a cake
My yacht couldn’t.
I have a contract with my breath, my father hasn't paid it yet.
Zahra abtez'al
Damn, that's it, mom.
My dad did this work.
May God be with him now.
I worked a lot so I can rest now.
He should rest.
He told me to make
I did it and prepared it.
I waited.
Fear God in this old man, be kind to him, be kind to his age.
Now it's your turn.
Tomorrow we'll eat.
The poor guy needs to rest.
May God be with you, you are beautiful.
This is a typo from return.
Wah wah, I'm tired.
I don't burden myself with their affairs.
Don't let them make me moan.
I was planning to close the bank transaction while I was going to work.
If someone is delayed, then he will be punished.
You're so sweet.
Tokli shuglej
Here on this nose and from these little eyes, Chinese, goodbye.
Bo سعید
This is how every day you rain on you.
The good one, O Saeed.
Damn, his scent.
In my nose
Khonroush Khonfar
Ashduk Maini
I'm fine, I'm at the branch near the market.
And a soul there
Seriously, I'm going to the branch that's in the market. They said it's not there, I'm not sure.
Inshallah, please, with peace.
I’m going to hit him with the sun.
The sun shines.
I entered my neighbor's house.
The maid informed me.
She asked me what's wrong with you.
May God guide you and protect you.
Lalla ma fini shudo khnfaroush Yame سعيد
Hey, where is my dad right now?
From Al-Luweh
This after I tell you which bank
They told him the papers were incomplete.
I'm telling him to take a taxi.
Hey, we had a problem with the manager.
The important thing now is how my dad is doing, hopefully nothing bad has happened.
She burned my heart and broke my head.
I am telling you in front of them.
Let your father rest.
Poor things, Saeed.
They must attend work after these reports are written in them and they make
How are you?
Hey, Bashayer.
You can say whatever you want about me, but don't say it.
What do you mean?
First of all, the years passed
It’s written on us to suffer.
Your brother is a liar.
We must help them
And the poor ones say to me
God, you have no business here.
Currently, young people who don't have passports will not be able to complete their transactions.
The function returned and the function is different.
In your job, you mean you allow me to leave.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
Bye, I'm leaving, just the coffee behind you.
Where, Abu Saeed?
With the intention to complete the deal and my son is happy.
The ministry here, I'm drinking coffee.
After God, Al-Arazi will take her with him.
Goodbye
Ugh, heal quickly, okay? Where will you be? Bye letter.
You’re the best for me.
I am warning you.
Because I heard you say to Saeed.
My father is sick.
I have nothing to do with you.
Tell your fathers to curse you if they don't complain to you.
I won't let you get away with it silently.
He doesn't speak.
May your heart burn you, may you regret it. Be afraid of God in this Rial.
You woke me up with your shouting and I don't understand what's happening.
Seriously, you were an employee in the government and you knew what a inventory means.
Wahaj wahahahaha ha ha ha ha ha iktubun hadhi al-awwal
Now, after really, after yes, they are going to do
Seriously, tomorrow is the last day to receive transactions at the Development Bank of Loans.
Goodnight from whoever is saying it.
Enough, man.
I told you a little story and you believed me.
He says he has a strip for you.
Interconnection
How are you?
Let your soul be silent and complete your deal.
There is nothing. There is nothing. There is nothing.
A man returned from outside, silent and thoughtful.
What word did I hear?
No shame, no conscience.
Don't blame your father for taking your position.
If this is how you want it
May Allah reward you with the best of what is due to you.
It was supposed to call you.
He's laughing hysterically while calling a spider, what's up with him?
Dear and precious Dad.
And you’ve never let us down throughout your life.
Wipe me
Khalla 'ala ana
Well, that's it, dude.
Esteemed and honored
Khawrush Khawrush
Thank you, Zayak.
My dear brother
May Allah reward you with goodness.
We decided and we're sticking with it.
We will finish our transactions ourselves.
You're welcome, my brother. May Allah bless you. Praise be to God.
And may God return it to you, dad.
Consider it the last one
But I can't, it won't happen.
Contact me now
I don't go to the Minister, he's not going there either.
The Minister will be upset with you.
He has to go before you go. No, no, no. This shouldn't happen. Everything except the minister.
I don't know what to tell you, man. I don't want to upset you.
Don't tell me and don't tell you
Your transaction is with me, consider it finalized and ready.
May your path be smooth as you go to complete a happy transaction, my brother.
May peace be upon you, brother.
Consider it the last transaction I’m closing for you.
You, father, who commands this.
Your son had to sign this paper.
It means taking her, bringing her tomorrow.
Honestly, I advise you to come today.
If the transaction doesn't enter them
You’ll be waiting for me after two months.
Goodnight until then, let him make her believe it's possible and I'll follow.
Goodnight, I don't need it.
Call him, but let him come for two minutes.
I’ll summarize it for you.
You don't know Saeed.
I'm not taking leave.
What is desired is only Morocco.
Not a quarter of them have it.
Who asked where you are?
He tells me when I'm with Saeed.
I am waiting for my work to finish.
Enough!
Sort out your papers yourself.
Jan tarsh a'yalik.
You don't have kids, do you?
Do you miss your uncle?
Please be my guest.
You’re welcome.
There's no point.
I'm leaving you.
Go to the elderly care home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going, I'll go.
Ashbiq says to him, "Ya Abu Saeed."
I'll write them something else.
Alhamdulillah
Yesterday I got out of prison.
No way, my dear.
We're messing around with these things.
He told me that he and you speak on the radio and on television.
I just want this to be trash.
Please guide him, heal him, and grant him goodness, God willing.
Ya Allah, my dear sister, goodbye. May God protect you.
He was arrested.
I was traveling.
My dear sister, how are you?
Please contact support regarding the issue with the Miles program.
You and my sister, the words of the pound.
Lee Ahmed
He just says stuff about nonsense.
My yacht, listen to what their buddies are saying at work.
My yacht is talking about the government.
I keep seeing petrol dollars
Mom, mom, what's happening here, boy?
There isn't one to his level.
Those who were happy with him and would tell him to do this and do that did it this way and did it that way
They all rejected him.
He has guided him.
I'm going, my dear sister, please let me go and there's a cook.
May Allah grant you goodness.
Come on, ya babi.
Come, sit down.
Don't mess around, kid.
"By God, Dad, I'm tired and sick."
This is a landslide in the hospital.
You don't deserve this, God willing, my love.
I wouldn't want to happen to you what happened to them.
Seriously, I didn't kill you.
Mom
And he began to scream.
I won't leave you.
Man, I almost made it this time.
I'm telling you.
Bless you, my dear.
Forget the subject.
It's a mess.
So why is the director's owl so sad?
It's shameful that after all these years, you're telling me you ruined me.
Do you understand what's being said, Saleh?
It's a mess.
Just give us that alone.
Order, O Saleh.
You are a human being, and this matter hasn't touched you.
You're amazing, you follow up on current affairs and criticize.
It's easy.
It's just like deleting one file.
You're one of them.
Aren't you the one they meant?
Goodbye.
Righteousness, O my friend.
But Inshallah, your uncle from Maryam doesn't know.
Hey, Dad, I'm going to mess with you.
Where is Pedri?
If I ask you
Tell him he works.
I cannot fulfill this request.
I asked his mother and she said that her husband works.
It is necessary
Mom needs to go.
What should we do with it now?
Anwar, my daughter and him.
What are you commanding?
I’ll give him two weeks.
But if it doesn't work, God forbid, I'll take it to court and tell him to—
I'm brewing coffee now.
You're just worrying like a stubborn donkey, only if it's in your head.
Seriously.
Dad, look.
What are you looking for?
I know you want to leave.
Your heart, it’s pulling you up to the coffee.
I want to talk and mess things up.
God, you messed up everything and now sleep. God.
Tomorrow morning, go look for work.
Inshallah, I’m leaving from the morning, you know.
Seriously, I told her already, God willing, I broke this habit.
As-salamu alaykum, wallahi.
Seriously, I'm feeling anxious, really anxious.
I'm not coming with anything except for some mess.
broken joint
It's not just old-fashioned stuff.
Hey man, you look like you're on silent, give me a word from back in the day, man.
We've only heard nonsense. We've only heard.
Don't bother with nonsense.
Don't bother with nonsense.
Valid exists
Sali Raqad
My son did something wrong, and I don't know about it.
We only did what was necessary to find the good coffee.
What are you saying?
Hey, that's fair.
They were some people around.
You call her just...
Don't waste your time with me.
If a single hand was at the door, its handle was hidden.
But greed isn't on you.
Greed has made you abandon your principles.
My son and my hand bread, I know you well, though not well.
You're like someone who's calm amidst the chaos.
I'm just saying something or not saying something, I'm just messing around or not messing around, I'm just nonsense or not nonsense, just nonsense.
I'm telling you.
I am broadcasting on the radio
Walla Saleh isn't mess/nonsense.
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high sense of national pride.
We can't bother you.
But what are we doing?
Oh God, please forgive us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
Jan, you've worked so hard for yourself, we care about you.
No, I swear it.
Bro, I'm waiting for you every day and saying it, but it's not a big deal.
Man, you're a brave man, you don't fear anything.
And I give you a greeting once, say it.
I'm fine, may God protect you, that's all.
Don't mention it, it's a cigarette. Say it, or let it be, just bullshit. God.
Ya Allah, the riyal has hit rock bottom. Seriously, just one, just for his sake.
Awesome man.
Listen, man, it's important now.
Regarding the position
The function reversed, you deserve it, you are a national and dear person to us.
We were calling you to inform you.
You are insulting Allah in front of His creation.
You're serious, right?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there’s nothing available.
Poor people, they are all so needy, but there are no jobs.
And now, how do you manage the house with your mom?
And don't forget after that
Four kids have
God is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Don’t be discouraged, my love.
Do you have hope?
I don't stop.
You need to look for work for me.
So my dad doesn't cause us problems.
I swear to God, Maryam, I'm ready to do anything.
And then I'll just talk about nonsense.
It's nonsense.
Do you know what I'm doing these days?
I told you
But you, God will guide you, ya Bu Fahd.
What are you hearing?
I wish I could tell the minister about all the trouble he's causing.
I don't understand.
He definitely understands it that way.
With you right
But this is something.
What is being silenced
Do you know that someone is being put in your place and you're pulling really hard?
I'm looking for a way to do it, I'm trying to figure it out.
I don't want anyone to feel like they have a stake in the subject.
Your idea is correct.
What am I thinking about?
The way that removes Sultan from your path.
You've heard about Saleh Saleh on social media nonsense.
May God protect you from this from our neighborhood.
May God guide him.
My dear brother Saleh, I miss your voice.
No, Saleh
I am one of your biggest followers.
Beautiful, Mashallah, after he needed it.
Inshallah, soon.
He comes back and you hear his voice and you enjoy it.
Buhfihd ibnufseh yas'al 'ank
Oh, my brother, Saleh.
Why did I stop?
"Wallahi, it's just a little bit of problems and some psychological and health issues."
But seriously
You consider me a controversial figure.
We haven't heard that in a long time
God God God I asked you, O Saleh, come back.
Just once for me
Dad, listen to it with your tongue.
Sallah says, "It's done."
Bye guys, it's really hard, honestly.
How are you?
The pound, I implore you.
Abd al-Rahman Ana Qati'
Then you didn't tell me you were looking for work.
That’s your chance.
The Saudi Riyal doesn't listen to you, and it won't appreciate you the next day. Go to his office and apply for the job.
If you don't cut yourself.
I want to fix you.
I'm learning how
Just... just leave it at that, go home.
La la la, enough, we don't want it.
Okay, come on, seriously, be patient, let me explain.
But, well, let's just say we don't want it.
Anyway, anyway
Okay, so if I were to go back, of course, I would have cut it off, but the last time.
Like, someone who likes, who likes, who loves, listens, listens.
Shalli Ianseh means there are a lot of problems and a lot of troubles, a lot, a lot of them present.
What is it that he still hears, like, or does he like demonstrations, I don't know, just say it.
According to the contract concluded
I relinquish his responsibilities.
Eighty-seven centimeters
It means to ruin the work.
Until I was interrupted
Why is the employee like this?
Where seventh seventh
Hold on a minute.
Seventh, oh Minister of Happiness
Why is the employee
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
I'm bringing my brother's royal cars.
Guys, this is just nonsense.
Wow, you came back to us with your voice, don't make us lose you again.
Who are these people who care about me? The last time
And I honestly cut it off, you know.
Hey, you said you were done, right?
You who forbade me
Oh, my dear.
This guy whose name is Osama, expose him on the radio.
I've only heard it once, they told me.
I doubt that one person in the ministry is leaking the information.
Oh, how intense is the atmosphere now?
The weather is awful.
The Minister has worked.
I don't care.
My time is all for the ministry, God guide you.
I’ve heard it for my life.
I swear, I said it just for you.
He gave me the way to my heart.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdullah says to me, "Go, I'll employ you."
He didn't speak to me.
Woe to you, O Saleh, you are wretched.
It really broke my heart.
I am a secretary of Fawwad.
And I know the whole story.
The guys were using you as a specific goal they wanted to achieve.
Unfortunately, they delivered it to him.
And you know from behind this whole thing.
Abdel Rahman Wald Farajkum
Wow, who planned all this?
Bufhed is impossible to occupy you.
I hope one day you’ll do to him what happened to Sultan.
You are constantly famous about you.
It's impossible for anyone to be interested in you.
I want to file for divorce.
I found the solution.
We are currently the best community in the world.
Defect-free
We don't have it.
We have no flaws whatsoever.
We are comfortable.
What is the intermediary?
Even if one knows you, he’ll tell you, “Take cover.”
Because the system
He asserts his rights more than a stranger.
We do not rely on the stranger.
We don't have it.
Your effort is your work, we have no flaws, we have flaws.
One of the adults
He went to sit you at home
There isn't any of that with us.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Famous for being a bunch of nonsense
I don't want dinner.
I was hanging out, running, then I went to iron the shirt and it ripped.
I saw you at TikTok wearing a hat nicer than mine.
Shaf bought a kid wearing the new shirt that you and I just bought from Filaggio.
He's pulling it with a boat, literally, to the point of it.
And this is good, what is it, Oush?
I'm putting it on my soul.
You, O notarial official, when I saw that beautiful boy, I waited for him.
It's complicated.
Why are you wearing a t-shirt, Waleed?
His eyes are piercing, but just a new t-shirt, your belly has swelled, I waited for you to speak the truth, your father should buy you one.
Be yourself
Why are you tearing your shirt, Waleed?
I'm about to tell you
Don’t let me carry your stick in the trough.
I'm telling my brother Sultan.
Why didn't he spit out a piece of gum and chew it, and where is it?
Seriously, you little guys, you're not even close to my level.
This is people this is people
Hey folks
And he wants just honest and well-mannered people to be in Erbane and to respect him.
He doesn't bother with it.
The price of your words, O Sultan, and about nonsense.
The school kicked me out, you guys. I'm out, you guys.
Your lifespan is arrogant.
Raise your children justly
If you're not well-mannered and not knowledgeable.
I am still respecting myself.
And I don't want to make a mistake and shame him in front of his wife.
Your older brothers
And if you enter the courts and customs of Wadid again, or do something to him
I don't blame myself.
I'm wasting my time with you.
Respect yourself, man.
Leave her alone, let's go to her.
What did they say about them?
Hey, where have you gone, the first time?
Pure intentions
Please accept my forgiveness and blessings.
My brother, Malaki, you have nothing else but this?
Lalla Da Akber Hagga
Give me everything you have and come quickly.
The pit of trouble that fell on our heads
Oh, but my dad, tell me exactly what's happening.
Ahmad, I apologize for the work that has become a problem at home and I have to go.
Sherwani rahat
This is the action of a hateful, sickhearted man filled with malice and hatred.
This is this deed, Sultan!
Hey, where can I get all this clothes?
I don't appreciate them at all. I didn't enjoy wearing them. May God punish them.
I have to see him.
Sit down, I'm going to tell you.
If you go to a place in Binnekir, he'll say "Oh, people and so on."
What's the opinion?
You and your lovely son learned to ride a bicycle.
I know.
Waleed habibi
I'm saying
Just say it.
Where did you put the scissors, Mom?
Under the bed
Destroy their life
But I show you
I'm letting it slide.
This is a minor issue, he's not awake.
The most important thing now
As soon as we depart
But this computer thing, it's buggy for me.
I’m not letting you down.
Our son should be kind to the younger ones, break the computer if they want, and we don't know about it.
My soul, Nadia, my soul, Nadia, why are you so cruel, he or she did it.
Drop the nonsense, you fool.
Come on, come on, go around your friends, come on, make me laugh at someone else.
I'm telling you, notaries.
Laugh at others, you, Falcon.
I need your help.
Time of the still hearts
Pure intentions
In Yahla
I'm the one who goes around looking for my friends.
Mock others, you tyrant.
To concern me, a visit and slander
The scissors broke.
Respect yourself.
Oh, Abdul Rahman al-Haq, oh, Yabe.
You have a right to your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
Man, every day you guys are like this, you guys.
I don't know.
Let's do something like this.
We should sit her down.
In order to examine our work
And the work of those who came before us.
What will we become?
Let's learn from it.
And we learn
It's not a peace session you guys are asking for.
Like an ass
Do you have children?
He doesn't understand anything.
His father is his example, I don't have anything for you.
His father was his role model.
You, O Sultan
And you, Falcon.
I am the elder brother.
For me
He paid for the computer.
Okay, so when you extend your arm to...
It's about a reconciliation. Did you reconcile?
No, but like this I have no reason to get him out of it.
عبدالرحمن said he'll free me from my silence after I finished my pilgrimage.
Seriously, where are you going?
God, I won't let him.
You made the coming one.
Look, don't be afraid.
If you are a hero of the door, I'll tell you, hero of the door.
You didn't say that Abdul Rahman Saleh is good at something.
But, by God, if he enters his room and breaks it, he will break it.
My brother
Natural makeup
My brother is amazing.
Now, bring the tea.
Leopard on his head, leopard on his head.
Shush, shush, you guys are messing around. They're shameless.
You guys are little kids, but oh my god, but
I swear to God, I will show you, I swear to God, I will show you.
Damn, damn, oh my love, damn and she's so ugly.
Mom, milk
My heart with this scream
Oh Allah
Let's see how we're doing.
God, it's not right.
This and while I gather your possessions and your belongings.
I won’t be brief with them.
A day in the night to reconcile them
He didn't have time, you know.
And upon him, upon him
Wow, he/she is amazing.
Elegant, refined speech
But oh, my dear.
May God guide you.
You should threaten yourselves.
Far from you, my fire, wood.
And goodness, Lord, I hope
Take it easy, Abdul Rahman.
I need your help, I've become a pharaoh.
Oh, you reasonable one, may God guide you.
Two behind each other
Stretch, stretch
You’ve wronged us, may God guide you.
My neighbor, Saad, is always watching us and laughing at us.
Oh, the officer wants us, we want to tell him, but we can't.
Don't bother blocking him, officer.
They deleted the three of them.
Excuse me, please.
Man, you're not coming to me anymore, you're not coming to me.
The officer, believe me, I understand from above.
I heard the officer was on duty.
From above, you mean, far away.
My brother was right about him.
Could you please tell me if your sons are not going to prepare their lunches again?
Thank you, thank you
My brother welcomes you, please do.
The officer ordered them to move, seriously. I'm sure.
Listen to me
I wasn't trying to tell you this in front of them.
This is عبدالrahman, his brother Oud.
Assistant Attorney General of the Ministry
The second is their middle brother, a director of a foundation.
Take two Bendos and relax.
The officer prohibited that pendulum.
You have two pills here.
And and Allah is sufficient for me against the enemy.
May God be my judge against the enemy.
My God is enough for me against the enemy. Play my game.
And and and what is the conversation about and and and
Hello, is anything arriving from there to here?
This is a cousin's Abud's hand, it's his father's paradise, she's making a flat white, it gets deleted, yeah.
Do you donate?
He's a respectable and well-mannered young man.
And she says that girl, Farai.
Even if
Now he's catching up to you.
Or where is the sample from your eye?
I am pleased with you.
Oh hey, everything is good, but the opportunity hasn't come yet.
What was it like when you passed by and I looked at you?
Discovery means
You turn, and she turns at the same time.
Sure, but definitely there's something.
I notice when I pass by you
I feel like there's joy and happiness inside me, like I'm enjoying it.
Man, go say it to me, give me a pen.
Take my notebook
Give a donation, man, I don't know her name.
Overly romantic
It doesn't matter what you're doing right now in the 21st century.
God, you look amazing.
I want the truth.
From whenever we sat in this gathering
Don't worry.
From today, I intend to dedicate myself to you.
But seriously, you really need to relax now.
It's just something that happened after yesterday's outdoor shoot.
God didn't kill us, my brother. The secretary said he's close to being dead. Check, I didn't have any press meetings or television appearances, not even contracts.
Let me free up some time for my family for a while.
May God help you.
Even when you're busy
First, I put it in my mind.
And I have her number by the word today.
I was late for what?
It doesn't suit me to dwell in it and live in it for a few days.
Cave in the series and acting
Abdulaziz says they are poor people and of the same level as them.
What's our share in it?
May God give you a good morning, Uncle.
May God grant good, not harm.
Man, this car—every day and another one breaks on us.
It seems your battery is Abu.
No problem, I don't want to, but I have the donkey and we'll ride it for you now, God willing.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
Hey man, hey man
Peace be upon you.
Waleed is telling the truth.
I'm done with tomorrow, I'm going to leave and stay there until you all come back every day.
Hurry up, what's wrong?
Oh my God, seriously!
Please
But Waleed what?
Rashid Abdullah
The same name
My brother's right hand came back.
You did well.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, the actor I love, is coming.
Everyone was praising her.
They say he's humble and kind.
The old man before the house, yes.
I am recording with him.
So that the quarter in the job believes me
I can't believe our house is attached to the house of the actor Rashid Abdullah.
Tell him, tell him so he will believe.
Joffa, the world
What I saw on TV
And I wish to see him.
Thank God, O my Lord, thank God.
They want Jaloop with a sail. I have it.
I am here, I am here. But guys, seriously, I'm really struggling. I haven't gotten a fair deal yet.
Received the news
God bless you, may God reward you with goodness.
Peace be upon you.
Confirm that there are employees transferring to the new ministry branch in Adham.
What did they tell you again
I haven't heard the names.
But what I heard and it's for sure
I know Ali, they have him.
My name is me.
But as time goes on, we don't exactly know who we are transferring.
I am here, I am with myself, and me, and me, and with myself, and me, there is smoke, I couldn't, God didn't allow it, excuse me, I couldn't.
Seriously, can you do it or can't you? This is serious work.
The committee is still studying the issue.
But if you choose me
The blessedness visited us, O Abu Waleed.
You're welcome, you're welcome, oh Abu Ali.
I apologize, brother Rashid, for the furniture.
We are neighbors today.
He is a respectable man.
This is from your good origins, Abu Waleed.
May Allah reward you with goodness, dear brother Rashid.
I heard you're really kind.
May God grant us love.
Oh, my dear.
I’m ready to offer you a thousand sofas until you find the most beautiful and affordable furniture you like.
My country's furniture has really come back to Basra, and it's very old.
I need to change it.
Inshallah
Tell my yacht, I killed it before.
If you need anything.
Treat me like my little sister.
May my eye not cry for you.
Where did you go, my love?
Yesterday, she spoke to me and I forgot to hug her.
I'm not tired, my love.
No more
May Allah protect you. I’ll call you later.
Honestly, I was talking to her.
But these people are not of our cloth.
Oh, the rich ones, where are they? Where are we?
Hey, what's up with you?
Hey, what's up?
You guys, just wait for me a bit.
I'm going to give you the signal when you should propose to me.
I am telling you.
I don't know what you mean.
She comes to me and tells me my fiancé.
I put dinner in the living room.
If I want to have dinner
Now I'll have the driver drop her off at the university, hopefully.
And then we didn't agree that we are family.
Damn, what's that car?
Soon, God willing.
I called her, thanking her.
Ya'ud wa yaheebun al-khair inna ya'meem
I swear, you're right, brother.
Even if our family does things like that.
My name is definitely them.
Are you sure?
This is a disaster. All the problems are coming to us.
Tell me, now, my head is spinning from this news. I don't know what to do.
Soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, you, now, inshallah, inshallah, good, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
Best friend, oh Abu Ali
The committee today included
It turned out to be a list of names they are transferring: Adhan
My name and theirs
Write down the manager's name so he can take your name.
I don't think it's worth it, Ali. I don't think it's worth it.
I told him and he said there's no hope.
The great artist
Consider your name what was put in the list.
You did well, you have nothing to apologize for. God bless you, Abu Salem.
Came back if you’d like.
I'm going to take pictures with you so the kids can see them.
Oh, my days, my passions.
May God preserve them for you, hopefully.
Could you send me a picture of an artist?
At your service, God guides you.
Please, please
Take it easy, take it easy, okay.
You and whoever you love.
Tell me a day or two before, it’s better.
Ya Allah Ya Allah, ya bima, istahdi
Get ready, get ready, right now.
What's up, Yinet?
She said I don't mind.
Let me come to my mother.
Oh my god, they got me.
Seriously, my son.
They don't feel that we are poor people and of our own level.
Need to retouch
Where should I go to get dressed up and look good?
You've gotten me into trouble with people.
You're showing off your jewelry for the first time like this?
My God, I swear it.
My right.
Don't let Fatima marry for her son Ali's sake.
I want clothes that are fair and I want a little jewelry.
According to her, she wants to show them that they are important people who are content and have good things, you know.
Oh my gosh, Mashallah.
Who is it?
Mashallah 'aleha, ha hathi umrati watilata wa zarraqat ha.
Mashallah, alhamdulillah, I don't say anything.
It's hers, Mashallah, beautiful lady, it's hers.
You'll need to prepare afterwards.
He's saying that my dad should meet her father.
I definitely won't go to the bazaar.
My first time, I'm making the new handmade dough.
Seriously, oh my God, I'm roasting, roasting on the old man's (husband's) bed.
"Seriously, Waleed, you didn't mess up. You gave me these amazing dates, just a little bit more, roast them a bit more."
Oh!
Be good, we need to become like them too
Why didn't her mother go to arrange a marriage for him?
But those women
Now I have to go see the men after.
May God protect you as you deserve.
May God protect you. Bless your bedspread.
May Allah reward them with goodness.
We’re just a little short, you know.
I came back, I'm going to take it from you to finish the period.
Everyone is calling you
I just need my brother Rashid to calm me down like this, or how does he do it?
No, just look, come. First of all
This needs to be closed.
Oh, he's calling me.
Roast the rope upon your garment, but look.
May God protect you.
The left hand inside the bacht
Mehdudeh threatened in this way.

God God
Wow!
The more, the more heavy, I need more heavy, a little heavy.
Ya sa'i
Make yourself a millionaire by July.
What are you waiting for, hopefully a few seconds.
The left is degraded like this, the right is this color.
My friend, Aisha, is known.
Aysha, may she be well.
You're asking me what I'm saying.
Tell me how much you are my friend and how we don't want to separate.
I'm telling my brother to go ask for your hand in marriage.
Tell the truth about how she wronged you, don't say anything about how her brother embarrassed himself.
I'm getting more letters about you these days than I did a few days ago. Saad wants her brother's money, and today it's about her brother's money.
They want to take my girlfriend.
I'm watching.
He doesn't know the relationship between us.
They don't know, we're just colleagues.
Damn it.
I have to know tomorrow.
Why did Wail refuse?
I am screaming
You're exaggerating about your son, Waleed.
The actor Ashraf from you, you hypocrites.
But you guys
How old are you?
May your floors be beautiful.
We worked.
You are taking advantage of people.
You wear costumes and makeup in life before God and His creation.
The thobe I portrayed in the television show
I and you (plural)
You wore the accessories, gold, and jewelry.
And you played a role.
You got married.
منز شنو
A man is walking in front of his wife.
I don’t understand.
He doesn't look to the right or to the left.
Man, you reminded me of that privilege you guys are talking about with you at the office.
Come with him, he has a son and a daughter.
Why does he keep walking like that?
As they say
God be with you, man.
Walking non-stop
Poor, he has no personality at all.
He's laughing with joy.
It’s a pity about her dress.
La la la, ya, you're so sweet when you're around.
It's like that, you know, while walking and standing still, stop, stop, stop.
I asked you, Khamis, I asked you.
He's going to the stadium.
Come, I want to grill you.
Where should I sit with you to grill?
Ambedehle marte
You probably won't like that for that reason.
Oh, Khamis
The television is canceled and if it appears for sale
I'm afraid you're causing me problems.
And by God, in the work.
I'm just sitting here with Salim at work.
Hajja
The line says: "Yod yod"
The phone is messing up my house now, now it's causing me problems.
Now you're saying you didn't let your friend even ask me to go with you once?
Well, now, maybe God will help me. Please, God, help me with this package.
and it kicks you out after
You weren't the first one to shoot.
Sleepy, I can't sleep.
Torture my mother in her grave.
My mother advised me to
She told me, don't shoot.
I can't, impossible.
Looking for something you?
Lala la la la la la la
You're so naturally amazing.
I won't come to you nor to anyone else.
Tell me, what do I mean? I want to understand what's happening.
Lalla yma, ana ya ma-samit leek it-qool hakalam.
Salem by himself considers himself to be among the best of our youth in the region.
He's telling you that he's divorced.
He's saying he's divorced, completely done, just finished. It's like a bull that's completely roasted. Seriously?
You don't look like a formal wife.
Let me let me and the one who delivers you.
Damn, he's talking to our soulmate about our secrets.
May God guide you.
The poor man’s heart aches.
My father, give him the message from the Minister's office, it's important.
What does God give you to guide you? What does He give you?
Hello, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Give it to her, I’m taking it to him.
Because I want to hear from the female delegation that is coming to us.
Women's delegation
What's up? What's up? You're sleeping today?
Hello Salem
I am your brother Khamis.
And, by God, I’m talking to you seriously, by God.
Hey man
Hey, my name is Attaboon so they won't block me, bro.
How do you spell your name?
The only person who can have your name erased is Saad Al-Aziz, and that’s it.
Bro, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Listening and official record
I'm talking
Sālim Sālim Sālim
Tell the truth.
Who did you use to bribe her, and you went behind the tank?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm really fine, truly fine.
As long as you're well.
She says, what is it?
Ali ana
I don't have to, I am, O fifth.
You're saying the truth, man.
No, way, casual after
He doubted me because of the way I talk to a woman.
As-sha'la'a 'aad
And may God protect you, call him safely.
And I give you so you can be righteous
He's the one who told you, call him.
You are the owner.
I won’t get involved in things that don’t concern you, and you know I’m focused on you.
I complained about you.
Hello, are you?
How are you living with a woman whose legs are long?
Let’s start listening now.
Long live Hassan, where has Khamis gone?
Let's discuss that real estate budget first.
Please be seated.
Inshallah, I’ll definitely fix it.
I'm telling you the first time I saw the women, he was afraid.
I circled the ministry completely, and you're coming here.
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, the people are waiting for you in the gatherings hall.
I couldn't stay with the women.
Ya Khamis Martak, ashloon tardi
I'm afraid you're calling
I don't understand you anymore, my brother. You don't get it, you know.
Ikon Earn and Mashallah, after I return home.
Your wife won't call except at this hour.
Of course, as a large company...
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry
It is the largest project in the history of the ministry.
Guys, what's wrong with the table? It's shaking.
I'm not the table, you know.
Keep my reply
Who's with me?
Who ordered the Syrian?
Telephone for lo
The moment, the moment, I tell you.
He fainted because he was afraid of going home.
Oh, my brother.
He says if my sister dies at work, with those women, don't come home.
That's why he submitted a letter to the ministry to be transferred from our department.
He told me himself, definitively, that the minister approved it, meaning he did what you wanted, so you'd be happy afterward.
Bro, what's up with her?
This is an unknown.
I want to tell him, خميس, I'm going to talk to someone
I'm telling you, he's not awake.
And now what are you going to do, husband or not, your wife and kids are coming tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
And you fulfilled your request so you didn't let me leave and see your children.
Because she wants to confirm officially
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, this is what I did: Anyway, this is what I made, I sent it to my brother, and gave him the paper.
So he could see the Minister's signature and confirm it.
Inshallah, I’ll agree if you agree. Inshallah, tonight we might be able to return home.
Madam, and this is the Minister's signature.
After a clash
Tomorrow is the opening of the new department.
It means I hated the office and switched to something else that I was doing.
May God protect you, may God guide you.
Oh God, may God protect you. And this is a minister's permit.
Nothing, nothing, that's all on your right hand.
Yes, yes, God’s grace.
Please accept this gift, it is ready.
And Saeed and Abdulqader and Mashallah, it’s a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you order a move?
Man, the whole department is women.
The madam is
No one can make a decision again except the minister himself.
You have to keep waiting until the minister returns.
Man, you and your girlfriends agreed, right?
You called him باسمي رياييل so that your wife wouldn't recognize him.
I left you two extra of the new employee's salary.
The new employee came to the new employee.
Those who came to the Minister's office and are two men who are with us.
Seriously?
And its shape is funny and on it there is a mercenary real imagination between five women, its appearance is antique.
They say when his wife envies him, she pretends to be interested in others.
blindness
Poor wretch, as things stand.
But he asked us that if his wife called, we shouldn't talk about him and remain silent.
Hey Abdulqader, who's with you at the office?
Is this too much for you to handle, my love?
My son called and said my wife is coming to the office.
What should I do?
Roh Seda, Right Page Chapter One
This is the care office.
With the fifth of women
These women
It is present I ate act an he is enduring.
I shouldn’t do this.
This is my wife, I tweet at her.
Because I am sweet.
Now may God guide you, O Sultan.
We just want to be known and where we've reached.
My uncle who passed away, my brother Saqr and I were at the bank yesterday.
Check that from this side the project
Hello everyone.
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Oh my God, my soul is going to the kitchen, quickly! Oh my God!
Now I'm dressed up and going out.
You should be in the kitchen.
We don't have women who obey men. Come on!
And if the scorpion gets angry, God is enough for the venom of its sting.
This rain gear is essential, look look
Hey, Grandpa
Aysha and whoever calls you, call the secretary and tell him to inform the employees.
They say that Maryam postponed today's meeting to tomorrow.
May God will it.
They issue these orders
Woe to us if we do not carry it out.
You should know it's a big problem.
Varaj Communications and Responsibilities
They have a maid there and that's it.
I haven't seen people in my life treat women like they're less than they are.
Still living those old times
Come on, don't go to work, come into the kitchen and make me some tea.
The servants are settled.
The second one has been wandering for a week.
Even the maids didn't escape their insults.
They have the extinguishers.
May God help you.
The notes from the bank were simple.
The coming
My uncle means what do you mean?
It's a complex villa complex, it's not beautiful without a garden.
Anyway, the garden is now
My dear, before you go out, I'll get a consultation on a matter.
My love, Fatum, I have to leave late for work.
Okay, come on, tell me what's wrong with you?
Are you saying it or am I leaving?
Play with her at school.
Returned to the Committee of the Women's Union
The school chose me to play with them on the team.
You are amazing.
Now you're telling me you're going to the national team?
Do you know when you think about and say these things to your brothers and cousins, how they upset you?
I won’t blame but your selves.
This is a warning.
Don't tell her you passed by and greeted her. It's been a long time since I've seen you, man.
You’ve been stuck like that for years.
Did you marry him or after?
I swear, may God guide you.
May God guide him, the one who takes one (referring to a bribe) without knowledge, without education, and without knowing anything.
Goodnight. What's wrong with the Dirham if you're not learning?
And then this is Thursday, son of scorpions.
He stung him, he held him.
And what is not taken, we take it alone, its level.
Needle analogy
May God help you.
What should I do, Aisha?
The minister traveled and all transactions are being handled by me.
And say the truth, Mustafa Director of Resources Aminah, it’s your turn tomorrow.
Just FYI, the Ministry's contractors arrived today.
Do you have the program?
And now I'm going to check on Ya, Aysha.
Here Mary.
Okay, let's go. Okay, come on, oh my god, now okay, come on.
What would you say, Aisha?
All this trouble where does it come from except from these brothers?
My mother, what's happening?
My love, you need ice packs for your face so it doesn't puff up.
I warned her and told her not to tell them.
She said to them, "Jan, what are they doing to you and Ibexon?"
Do you know what would happen if I told them I hated it?
John, how long have you been waiting for me?
Are you playing soccer?
Next time, break the neck

Sultan and Falcon, I spoke to them.
They have no objection to marrying Amina.
What's up
Our son, Khaled, deserves it.
Arrange an appointment with them and let them know as soon as possible, God willing.
Filtering from the delegation
I can understand you.
But give me a chance tomorrow like you gave me one.
I'm just being honest with you.
You are very interested.
And the roof is from above
He is telling the truth.
My brothers and I know them.
It's impossible they'll agree.
I'm surprised by them.
Installments of their cars are on my salary
I'm the one who pays for the house.
Don't tell me to go with you after you say you don't want to.
We're supposed to marry her this week.
What do you guys say?
The idiot Khamis who doesn't even have an elementary school certificate.
I married him and I travel with him.
Yaaj al-ilm ya Allah
By God, it's forbidden to them what they are doing.
If you reject them, they will kill them.
Man, I've told you this a million times.
Let me go
I'll go tomorrow, I'll go tomorrow, Inshallah.
What is your real name, scorpion, son of the scorpions?
Even if it’s a little bit, it’s okay.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
Let me go to the kitchen.
Put them in the living room.
Tonight is a Real Madrid and Barcelona match.
Inshallah, we won't let them win in Valencia.
I'm talking to you from reliable sources.

What do you think about what's happening now?
We're making it.
Despite our disagreement
Please proceed to your desks
Thank you, may she live long.
The text appears to be
There you are
She strived for it.
May God preserve her and grant her a long life.
May God prolong your life.
May God bless you, Minister of Women's Affairs.
Yes, you are old.
I washed the trousers.
Bring a cup of coffee for Captain Emad.
And also, after
We are traveling tomorrow to China, we will play a match there.
Hey captain, you'll know her when I introduce you to my sister Mary.
Where are you going, Uncle? Where are you going, Dad? My father is going to Al Majd.
You are an idiot.
If you don't know your own back, you won't take your minister.

Take out this bullshit they're putting on us in the committee.
This is a problem. I'm sure he won't stay silent.
And he will explain it to us on the unit.
He's talking to me about art and the values of family and meaningful art and I don't know what it is.
This is what they put in for us at the committee.
The minister is the one who caused the problems of the committee.
You and I and Hamed can spread it around, but like this.
Goodnight impossible
There's simply nothing to prove it's mine or Al-Hamid.
Even if the Ministry of Economy goes and asks
After he finds our names
May God protect you and the company registered under the name of Hamad’s wife.
From this point on, I don't come.
Then you'll realize later on that the chairman of the committee isn't me.
The final crucial word is for me.
Bye bye, everything is good. Welcome, welcome.
Tony spoke with them and agreed with them on everything.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you. Hello Mr. Rashid, please have a seat.
And as you know, you know that listening is tailored to the bit in agreement with the rape of the conscience.
Wahwah from the production of Masat عصريه للفنون Institute for Contemporary Arts
Sweet, strange, bold action series
I am with Hamad
Honestly, the series has a really great story.
I'm with you, Hamad.
What I liked even more was when the mother took the pistol and killed her neighbor.
I want you to get into the pistol, let him catch it in the car.
I don't know if this is her son's car, an action in Iowa, the police searched.
Her son came from school
What cartoon is that?
He gives that strong cartoon and flies it and enters it from the window of his room.
Congratulations!
Wow, this shot, this shot, and the cartoon is going into Mom's room.
It's nice that a local company is stepping up to this level of work.
We must encourage them and take their hands.
Well, Mr. Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion.
You've made Khaled a mess.
Despite my respect for your opinions and impressions about this series called "The Soul Rape,"
Rape of human values
And surprises of the fish
Admin and 0.5 in each loop
The episode was messed up.
Unconscious writing
It does not carry a purposeful message that elevates the community.
Tears were falling, so we had to shout to the witnesses.
Rashid, please.
You said your opinion on what he said. I said my opinion, and then Mr. Rashid will say his opinion.
It is clear from yesterday.
I'm smelling an agreement between you two.
I'm arranging things.
Some people understand this and it's their specialty, and some people have no connection to the topic.
I reject this series.
I'm scared it will mess things up and cause us problems.
Don't count on him.
Ashbiswi wala ebiqdar eswi shi
I am walking my word.
Jan is giving me the juice and telling me "Hi from Mom Samira."
I don't know what's going on.
I can't believe it, Nasser.
I'm working on the new series that I'm going to release soon.
Anyone who touches a girl is a rapist.
The more good that’s between us, behind it.
Of course, first of all, this beautiful ring that’s on your hand.
I'm asking you how.
My wife, Hamad's fiancée, gave you the ring.
And his wife, of course, had the role of smoothing things over and dealing with matters.
He has a 5% chance of success.
Sweet deal
Tony is playing a role in a series about a rape named Amany, who was very good.
By the way
What is this rape, rape, oh my God?
Any dream rape
Why are all the names like this, they're all so similar?
You know, for example, in the past, most of the dramas were all about girls.
You'll find there are more than eight girls and ten more after that.
Reservoirs
Come, Mashael, we have here.
Oh oh, your luck has improved after arguing.
Hello Omar
What is it? What is it?
Sorry, honey, I have to go to work. What's up, Mary?
Three minutes and soul.
He says he needs me for an urgent and important matter.
I need to go.
I know that Rashid is gone and met with the minister.
He sat with him for half an hour.
He said those guys would mess with your head.
I'm telling you, they complained about us, tell me nicely.
What happened now is that the Minister's office is calling me, saying they're asking me.
And after that, the minister excused himself from Sadah.
The minister, I am meeting her.
The Yanai real reaches his point of view in the series.
No more
This is right, you know.
But first, I, as the Minister, wanted to clarify a point and this is something that isn't in my nature to talk about a colleague artist who isn't here.
May God protect you, Rashid. Everyone knows this feature.
He hates everyone around him.
all material self-interest
But he is a specialist, after all.
Please forgive God, meaning not everyone comes and expresses their opinion and changes things in technical matters.
Especially television works
A rape of the soul, may God protect you, that we are working on.
A monumental, bold deed
At the Gulf level, God willing, we will have previously informed you.
and a terrifying spread
You guys, of course, this is your specialty and you know it better than I do.
Sufficient circular cylindrical pipe
And we raise our name above
But what the journalist Abdel Hamid is writing, listen, listen, listen
It is said that one of the actors commented that
The series contains unethical calls to prayer.
He regrets the decline in moral and artistic taste in the work.
And indeed, it is bold speech and strong criticism.
Your friends will get angry if they follow journalist Abdel Hamid.
If their words reach the officials
These people are smart and know how to plan it.
Zillā ʿaṣābah
We want to make a website for ourselves.
We put all the company's activities in it.
The company’s name is what they told me.
Today and you are the media consultant.
And it is considered a rape of the conscience, a series produced under the supervision of Mercury Production House.
Qualitative jump in Arab drama
When he carries with him his thought and values, he is noble.
It is a series aimed at developing the community.
The journalist Abdel Hamid himself, the ones who have been criticizing him for a few days.
It makes sense that it turned 88 degrees.
How does Abdul Hamid expect to act like this?
The journalist Abdel Hamid Washaleh
Relax, Professor Hamad.
He asked me what I thought of the series. He said he was killing it on a regional Arab level.
May God hear you.
Guys, my artistic feelings are telling me that our series, Abizrab, is amazing.
I don't know where I can find it.
This guy is going to put his bag somewhere.
To start, I don't encourage.
You guys are like this – the things you bring to the shows that we didn’t find in our lives or hear about.
Written as it is from its title.
Honestly, all your authors are useless.
What would happen if it didn't happen?
Your show is awful, awful.
What do you guys think?
It looks like he's going to scream a lot.
We're measured by trivial dramas.
Anyone can understand and grasp it from the first time.
Within threads and hidden dimensions, it requires focus so that one can understand what he wants to say by this work.
By the way, this work is a political move.
Don't argue with them.
What's up?
They say you're eating poison.
Yesterday in the evening, Ali and I were at Souq Waqif.
And we are at a coffee shop.
He gave me a direction.
Nasser, what do you think about the topic? If the Minister gets sad, it's a big problem.
For one whole week, we'll all be staying at our homes.
God and the series, justice is justice, what are they saying? Everyone who was left out says they are a failure.
I'm hearing that Rashid is planning to go to
And he tells him that the series is a failure and it's falling apart and it doesn't have any action.
I messed up, man.
Leave it alone.
And in the voice of Nasser Ashbisawi
Listen to me, Eli.
From now on, I won't post any topics on your page that criticize the series.
Eli raja
I gave the topic a few days ago, and it was criticized for the work, there was insult to the work.
Please don't make me upset about you.
He embroidered it.
But I was once an opportunity.
If I hadn't said such words like this ever before.
Honestly, after they didn't even send me a message thanking me for the series...
What is the unprecedented success
Goodbye
Rashid, please excuse me.

As-salamu alaykum, this is a journalist we agree with.
Listen to the second newspaper, sketches written
Once you agree with the people, read read on the reader page.
My heart stopped.
If they don't say it to me
Wow, you guys are tall, the minister is looking at you.
Honestly, Nasser,
Prepare for the Rape of the Ego Part II
La la la, just please, oh my brother, don't let this continue.
First and last series I write
I'm really frustrated with my job, the sugar is better than this situation.
Part two after this mess
And third and fourth
What's wrong with you? Why don't you want any benefit?
One of the guys is at Melrose.
This is our problem.
The magician said.
Forward
We need a word for this amount.
Praise be to God for the success.
To the doubters, enemies of success.
I'm surprised.
How could a show win an award and be awful and a failure?
But these people are professionals.
Give them the awards for sure, you’ll see something we don’t see.
Prepare a second part for the series for us.
Inshallah, long life.
What they said, a magician is a magician.
The Rape of the Soul Part II
I saw you were standing with the minister at the beginning of the event.
After the televised festivals, we agreed on it, meaning
He's hearing them say, "Prepare yourselves, part two is coming up."
The same
It's dirty, they put it in the banks to wash it and make it clean.
What are the series I'm seeing that are crappy, weak, and pathetic?
Enter them into Gulf and Arab festivals
In order for them to be washed, they need to be cleaned, given awards, and become prestigious series among people.
Is that even possible? Why isn't it possible?
As long as the arbitration committees themselves are the ones producing the series.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you too, and blessings. Praise be to God that you arrived.
Yes, and we have a contract with them, but they want to lower the price.
Come to the office.
We are a small bakery, and I sell bread and rolls.
We are one of the largest bakeries companies in the world.
You don't come down nor a dollar.
They want us to cancel the contract or not.
Enough with the contract we signed yesterday.
With the European Company
Key K.B.W.
What you see
He took on a big job, but he didn't get it.
For the first time, our house will be the first product in the world.
This is what I'm bringing, I'm the biggest baker in the world.
I'm telling you.
How did he establish his system?
Let me strangle him with my hand or you go to the kitchen for an hour to look for a prisoner so I can kill him, and maybe your hand will be cut off.
I brushed this sandwich with the butter.
He puts the cheese and then calls me.
This is my routine this is a translation.
No and the most beautiful roasted dough bag, boy how boy
Abu Nasser and this woman, how are you throwing her away?
So, when someone leaves work, they tell their friend, "I've overslept terribly."
Why didn't Jabal Nour hospitals go there yesterday?
I know I'm asking why you didn't go yesterday.
The thing is, old man, that the bakers and the overseers who are in charge of the estate
Response to bakers
Seriously? That's all you've got?
He's just constantly arguing with him like that.
I've been dealing with this nonsense—whether it's good or bad—and it's messing up my work.
Do you know if your son likes soccer?
How are you? It means if they take a few employees from the company, they'll have fun.
You have 400 employees in the company, what should I do?
These ten one these are considered the main players.
And above them, they took him four backups and two administrators, but I’ll take what I want and on top of that, they charged me seventy-five.
Spokesperson for the team
I just posted about this on this messenger.
But I'm carrying the team until I improve, even though the fans, the audience, consider me the most important player on the field and the player number twelve.
Let him enjoy it in that Iraqi way, in front of me while he's happy.
And we are a group of companies that have contracts with them.
Now it’s a day when I wanted to play football with him. I miss him a lot.
He hears your whisper and obeys you.
Nothing like it.
Now, so that he got a few employees and then he made them play in front of him, he’d look at them, have fun with them, and enjoy himself, and then he’d bother him and annoy him.
He didn't kill him, he takes employees.
Even if you have to hire temporary staff to replace someone who left, it doesn't matter.
The important bakers
Oh my God, what are you saying? I'm dying! You're going to take the important bakers after all?
If it's the second time you hire employees, tell me.
No, no, this transaction, let Hamdi review me in it.
Thanks to God, he is in the hospital.
Why haven't you ever met him?
The shift ended and I'm leaving to ride my wife's car.
Listen to you, Nasser, may God lengthen his life and bless him.
I walked past him.
The goalkeeper told me, the one who plays with us and doesn't have it, that we have an important match tonight.
He said they're asking us to find a goalkeeper. We arrived at the stadium.
What did the goalkeeper say, should he wear?
I’ve never played a ball or held a ball.
This is a placeholder.
What he keeps silent about
And when you hate me after we see a job for you, let's get straight to the point, no wasting time, no drama, no nonsense.
Let me tell you
Seriously, you're making me delete the whole team and fix it up.
Yes, correct.
Yeah, Dad, inshallah, on this nose, but I'm asking you.
It's forbidden, so let the team come out and ruin the final match.
Sleepy with him for the boy
I'm ashamed.
Congratulations on the win.
Teacher Naser, congratulations on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, this is the team, physically and mentally and psychologically, and thank God, the coach didn't fail.
Inside the hotel
Congratulations to all of you, and the party is just as you promised.
I'm saying my dad looks cool.
I'm afraid he'll be embarrassed and humiliated.
Abu Naser said, “This is a prayer for the Prophet. We want to congratulate you on your huge victory, International Bakeries.”
The great victory
God bless you. God bless you. God bless you.
Picture without a shirt, moment by moment, hold tight.
No
That’s a strange outfit.
Without a doubt, your care and attention, and your creativity, played a significant role in this victory.
And the coach's plan
But in the final, he played in a five-five-three-two style.
As a big athlete, you know that changing the plan confuses the players, but that bakery team didn't get confused and played a wonderful match.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first athlete in international bakeries, what advice would you give to players?
Until the end of time
Hello, hello
Long time.
Welcome them with Ahmed Sultan.
May God grant them life, they honored us. They really appreciate us, you know.
Dinner here
God bless you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it is considered a contribution from the private sector.
The team is done.
Jealous of us again
It doesn't mean anything.
Abu Abdullah Abdulaziz
Agent for the machines that we use in the factory
I saw how
This is the one you were hoping to meet.
The ball introduced me to him and I saw him.
Kill him, Ya Boubker.
You've always been distant from hate.
And what are you doing here?
For your soccer ball in its embrace, I see it between me and it, fifty centimeters, so I'm almost close to it.
Abu Nasser hasn't arrived yet.
No way, he didn't come today either.
At the conference about sports injuries, and as the platinum sponsor, I have to be present.
I haven't seen anything yet.
I saw the building behind the bakeries that used to be used as housing for workers.
Hello, this is sinking in the ball.
As we always do, our dear viewers, before every match, we meet with the icons of the sport and discuss with them.
This man who inspires a bakery team with his great ideas.
What's up with the International Bakeries team? We heard you're undertaking a comprehensive development process.
It means, like, about these offices and this hard work.
It's a trivial amount, I mean, I'm now exhausted from all of my million dollars, but just one.
It doesn't matter, I'm just humming and humming while grilling.
Haydi, you're the mistake, not me, bro Shahin.
My mistake.
I made a mistake.
But you didn't tell me that the players are needed in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf can reach imaginary prices.
The player’s score is 200,000.
They take it in the Gulf for three to four million dollars.
Please understand me, Mr. Masoud, how?
Stable fax from here
Show me your future and he is present.
I'm telling you again, my dad wants four players for the Yada team, besides the new charger with four players.
This is crazy, what is this? This is amazing, I'll put Billy and Reinoldo in his secret place.
It is written on it, ten thousand.
Yeah, yeah, my dad, but this price, God bless you, he had it from a Turkish club.
In the Emirates, they want it to be about a million and two hundred thousand.
What are you saying about me?
Okay, can we check the merchandise?
Definitely
Batha al-rajul
All code
Lalala, I'll give you everything organized.
So fat, may God increase it. This one is fat.
This is the cornerstone of a cornerstone.
The emphatic assertion
This is the most important thing for a player if it breaks after it's no longer useful.
You’re welcome.
I don't know if they're sending us to the club. I'm the automated club.
What are you saying?
Ya Allah Hamdi, namshi
Blessed, blessed
This is God protecting you, little ones.
Yeah, we're freeing them from the jungles of Africa, what do we do for them?
Then I raised them, trained them, and then they fell in the stadiums.
I didn't ask for anything, I didn't ask for your anger, man. Take it, dude. Take it, you have space in the car, or should I carry you in the pickup?
He was out yesterday and saw them covering us up.
I need the attacker
Kakakanwa makalali dindih laa
Einzel the defender
Kaju makakakani lululololo this phrase that is coming down.
Our coach is a cheater.
Inshallah on Mars
I don't hope for Spain on Mars.
I don’t like the way he reads the match report.
This works on line.
The match has its roots.
Inshallah, in two days.
What's up, your voice is carrying really far up.
You have this python script in Spain.
He doesn't want to believe that the coach is stupid and doesn't understand football.
Listen, listen, let him speak.
He knows that the striker for Al-Kafah Sululotica is from the Al-Jazaa area, like Ahmed الطيب said, and he also knows he is stationed there.
Nobody will hurt your head.
Stay away, you're annoying.
I know how to deal with this coach.
Why did the team regress why
The situation that's happening now is making the team, the coach's training group for the International Baker's League, think about changing it up in the middle of the game.
The players aren't playing in their positions.
And player Takolamakakookoolalalawo, this is not his natural place. He needs to move to the place where he always plays.
The coach said, "It's changing."
Kokonali pulls Hopowai Malalo
Inshallah, inshallah, inshallah
La la la, what's going on in the field?
What's happening now shouldn't be available outside of the team manager's purview.
Coach of the team
If you have any information about what happened after the match
Now everyone is watching and everyone is looking at the thing in front of the camera.
The game is rigged in the saying. Fourth goal for the winning team.
He will score the fourth goal and a star of the match today.
The coach is driving himself crazy.
He said, in short, my uncle Bounaaser doesn’t want you, the coach of his team.
And when you want what?
I'm watching the game on TV and you stay on the bench as a substitute, and whatever I say is the same.
My son, don't do that in your heart, it's not good.
Now tomorrow we have a game, how do we play without a coach?
Shisui aboku
Okay, here's the translation: "Okay, Rashid."
How are you, my baby? You've stolen my heart, tell me how are you.
Leave me alone, mom, leave me alone.
How are you?
My mother, my mother, my mother.
How do you call yourself? It's been a month since you got married.
God damn, I don't know, I don't know.
It’s from me and the roads, I let you go.
Oh my god.
Seriously, I have no idea! He suddenly told me, "Come, go to your parents' house."
He asked me why he said he's done, you're already divorced, you are divorced.
I swear to God, I have no idea what's going on.
They are a married couple separating, and people are saying things about us.
I’m with you.
May God guide you.
I actually didn't know you were separated from her until now, from you.
Just hang out for a minute and bake.
Her high morals
Barcelona Saturday
Abdullah's gaze
He returned, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
He says, Mom, on Saturday he's going to Barcelona again. He really loves this team, he respects it a lot.
I am hurting her and hurting her feelings.
He said, "Mom, Barcelona is down, and I'm saying goodbye. Let her divorce you and I'll take her for you."
I told her your daughter divorced because she left Barcelona FC.
But because of this, I'm going to call it, honestly, you guys.
I have nothing to do with you.
Wounding feelings is easy.
Wife challenges her husband's loyalty.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
The girl who doesn't respect global differences isn't worth our time.
They mocked Messi this time.
The problems between the couple have happened and we are left.
Instead of unity
The girls are many, and I wish for a thousand boys.
Listen to me, woman.
But honestly, I don't want to hear anything.
And from you, I told you not to enter this, and I know him well.
We told you not to enter.
Seriously, I'm losing it with you.
What's your problem, sweetheart? Don't even think about it.
Instead of unity
Seriously, I'm dying if he keeps bothering me.
But every time her word comes up to me
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona

Poor thing, what happened to her?
This girl's name is Mary.
She married for a month and divorced.

Let it get messed up and say what you want.
O best of them!
May you be blessed, my children, do not cut off your husband’s livelihood.
If God has decreed her sustenance, then embrace it.
Oh, will our livelihood and hers be cut off together?

He's not telling me no.
May God be my judge against this despicable, contemptible person, the queen of gossip!
They just listen and spread it.
It's nothing to worry about.
Understand it and tell her not to close the door to the good that opens for us.
He knows how to convince her.
Seriously, you're saying that now you believe that the guy was unfaithful because he left Barcelona because his wife left him?
Forget about the nonsense or you'll become crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity from your fingers.
And because of you, she decided to return it, and there was something or a flaw that made her do so.
Listen to me, girl, don't lose your mind over a tower of Babel.

He's bothering a boy from outside, he's tired and wants a hand to rest.
Seriously, every day I tell her "give me an apple, peel it, and I won't eat it." Every day she annoys me.

You are leaving me.

He's asking if anyone is selling a piece of land like this.
I seized a falcon from my father's hands.
Dad, why did you sell her?
God guides you with an eagle, meaning if his eye falls on something, someone can say "no."
Let's leave it up to God, man, but.
Welcome welcome, welcome, welcome

My son is the one who's getting the license.
May God bless you.
Congratulations on the license, eagle!
God bless you.
May you live long and prosper.
I asked you not to ignore me saying "yes."
You just say “yes, okay, for your age.”
A gift from me to you
And may God return the greeting to you if I don't reply to you.
My affairs are going well.
It's normal like this, so I met you and I told you, "You're a loser."
You shouldn't become a cheater.
Seriously, nothing's on me, Mr. Nasser.
Please explain how to do it. What do I do?
The circumstances served me.
We were sitting there.

Auntie, this is Bo Nasser, he is here, he is blessed, he exists in front of you.
From the poem
Some people are naturally business-oriented and love business.
Are you telling the truth, Doctor?
Hopefully, Shawyan will check on your brother.
Allah is the Most Merciful, hopefully.
To the people
Of course, this depends on upbringing.
You’re welcome, Doctor.
Boutaleb, honestly.
How did a falcon mean, the ease that he hated trade, reach this great economic situation?
If you encounter a billionaire today, the enemy is one of them.
You know, O Abu Saqr
Falcon chose the Order of the Griffon market.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Naser?
Mohammad called me and said that Abu Naser is hospitalized.
He told me once that you heard that a young falcon, son of Abu Falcon, wants to take his father’s car dealership.
The agency slipped from you.
It's a world you never get full of.
My dad is the one who helped him get into the market.
That's what made him open his eyes to trade.
Honestly, the doctor says his condition is really serious.
That's not right.
Nothing happens that doesn't happen.
Shocked he returned or supported, it's not my business, I'm telling you he shot her, he shot her, yes he shot her.
In the 21st century
We meet our dear viewers with one of the prominent figures of goodness and generosity in this country.

Of course, we have the founder and owner of the charitable organization, Al-Suqur.
Of course, if you spoke to me, O long-lived one, about this association
We all know your noble goals that you are striving to achieve, of course, for the world and of course for everyone.
Without pride or arrogance, or a desire for fame, and may God protect us from it, that means
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Universe. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, the Lord of the Universe, we are preparing for the arrival.

Now you told me that the dress is being prepared after a week. Send me a message saying it's being prepared after ten days. Bye.
You want him to take a little bit and more, right?
Inshallah, now I’ll handle things with Anoud and ignore you.
Why so many lights are we having?
Don't worry about the world, and don't worry about Nuud.
Hey, Fadi, they're harassing you.
Oh, my goodness, their words are beautiful, I'm jealous of them. It's not like my people are jealous of me.
Important, don't forget the topic.
My dress is ready.
Please, Fadi
Thanks bro Fadi
Hey, Fadi will be visiting me next week to pick up the dress. Okay, goodbye.
Be, be obedient, serve me.
Just send me the dress code.
I didn't like it.
MashaAllah, I went to Fadi's shop today, the work is great, and the girls are going and coming.
Praise be to God, we succeeded in this project.

Are you sure?
Listen up, man.
And God willing, you intend to keep it quiet about it.
Seven in the morning
I’m bringing you breakfast.
Don't tell me, I'm happy.
But I want you in a word
I heard that you
I'm thinking of starting a business project.
But where am I and what's going on? Please, calm down, my uncle's son.
Women's fashion design, designing something like...
Who is writing to you?
What is the trade?
Lala la la, but I am.
I need advice, I want you. I'm ready, so if you need help with something
You're welcome, you're welcome, uncle. You're welcome.
Dude, forgive me, please, I'm going with it.
Please, Uncle.
And it was the first time he told me if he wants to increase it.
Ya Allah, yaa Fadi, organize the shop, it's crowded. I'm looking.
The shop isn't selling enough.
I didn't say you're taking the shop you're in, God help you, take it.
Please.
This shop is being guided by a trader.
Someone named Khaled Sultan Al-Sayfi changed your cousin, Bo Nasser.
Nothing.

He's going to say something.
And I’m saying, I’m telling you, they say you’re planning to open a business.
Wow, you've really caught my attention.
And rely on concealing your needs to alleviate your difficulties.
It's a shame you and your things.
But what you're able to endure/bear.
Seriously, this is everyone's fate – each person gets their own share.

I am my friend Ibrahim advised me.
He is a Lebanese designer.
I was once asked by
I know our women justly die in Lebanon.
Madam Hida is returning to you, la la Hida. There isn't any of him in Doha entirely.
Madam, this is a good deal, and this sweet thing, and the piece we are selling for thirty forty thousand.
Is so like
The news about the suppression I did last year, bringing in the Lebanese carpenter.
Madam, I'm going to make you a closet that doesn't exist in Doha entirely.
If you want to succeed
What exactly?
I don't know.
Head of clients means
What do you say, man? You're not going anywhere.
Afa afa ya Fadi
They will play again with their souls at that time.
It means we lost.
I need to face it.
We have to return our customers, whether we want to or not.
You're on the hook.
I don't pay anyone.
Ready to do anything
But the important thing is not to overwhelm me.
This dress you chose cost sixty thousand rials.
Definitely without the ties present in the text
This is a gift from the designer to me.
And I'll put one crystal in it, there aren't more than fifty of these crystals in the whole world. This one is a special one, it's very special.
Absolutely no discount. Our prices are globally known.
Absolutely no. Who is even doing this?
Moment by moment, always be in the now, in the present.
Let us rejoice, O fortunate one, let us rejoice!
This is something they don't do.
Slaughter us, we don't have any customers left at all.
Haydi Asma Harb, ya boo Nasser
We were silent for them.
We must fight them like they fought us and respond to them.
I’m going to take out a loan from the bank.
And I will set fire to them and show you in them.
Don't bring her, Abu Bo Nasser.

It’s been six days since a customer last visited their shop.
And today at afternoon, they didn't open it once, they just stamped it.
If you haven't heard that it's for sale.
He'll kill him, he'll kill him.
Even if he can't sit, he's sitting outside.
Just drink your Jack and go to him.
Hey God, what's going on? Where am I and where is the guy? This is a problem.
You are being hostile to something.
This, may God protect you, someone is deliberately making the store's air very cold.
And these are chemical substances.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You guys are like boys, not little ones, arguing like children.
Yeah all night and his smell is bad in the store, like that's it.
I didn't spray this, it's your smell.
About mistakes
You signed a contract with yourself, promising to be a police officer.
I don't worry.
I'm here this time.
Prepare a hellish plan for him.
Without hesitation, Ali doesn't touch anything.
No way, everything is normal.
What's bothering me?
I don't know what's happening, honestly. This is the fourth day without a single customer coming to the shop.
I was forced to reveal my eyes, God help me, what a shame.
What did the doctor say?
I see the shop is yellow, I haven't entered it or been a customer.
I don't know what you're saying, tell him to do a spell.
The ladies and girls aren't really around the shop at all.
You say yesterday that designer Saad is a monster.
It's not far off, don't rule anything out these days.
Magic exists and that's after all.
Is he sleeping now or just sitting/relaxing?
Soul, enter him, my friend. Soul, I'm afraid the ceiling will fall.
I lost, oh Sultan, I lost.
My mother did it well.
He is a monster.
Take care of yourself, my friend, I will never bother you.
Mom, what should I do?
My love taught me that they are gathering money for him and paying off his debts, he says to his friends.
The designer who has

You told him. You told him.
What what what what do you know where are you going
The stars, the stars, the stars are there and this guy is searching for them with his movements.
They contacted the real estate again, maybe there's something going on.
Hey Ahmed, what's up?
Hey, Mr. Ahmed, come here and leave the thug to deal with me, I mean, what are we supposed to do and what? Where is the thug you told us to kill today?
Get lost, I told you better not to call me. My head hurts just asking Professor Abdullah.
First, I won't get tense because we are actors and we want to be relaxed a little bit. We want to focus on our roles. Second, the money (or royalty) called me more than once in front of me, they calmed down.
Shut shut shut what do you say, Mr. Abdullah? What do you say?
Dear Mr. Abdullah, what should I do? This broken man will finish the scene and reassure me.
Ya Allah, oh young people, Ya Allah, oh beautiful ones, the next one, the next one.
I’m so tired, Mr. N N N N. We should finish, but those comparisons that need to be shot after the scene haven’t been.
I don't want anyone to talk about you well.
Make your work impressive and without boasting.
This is our situation – everyone is screaming since morning, wanting to focus.
I found a solution for you.
You in? Take care, bro. Scene like this until Allah lets me get an actor who can do the role right.
Yeah, I want to do one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Hey, it's okay if you take pictures.
But if you weren't ready, I won't be messing around today.
Above the youth, oh God!
What are you looking for in a Filipino guy?
You're not known as Waleed, but he always tells you he wants someone who comes from a nightclub and is from Qatar.
My lord, we'll be wearing turbans and sandals, you know?
Alaa, you're really you, you want, just like this? You're going to boil someone like this. This is production, respect people's feelings, man. You have intelligence.
You're always putting everything on your head and delegating tasks so you can relax.
Relax, let's think about things together. Rem might remember someone from the neighborhood.
Who is it from?

The troublemaker will make you lose it, he wants a rich and imposing guy, a real tough guy.
My love, it's over in the end, he's a sidekick, meaning he's giving one to a rich and powerful guy.
But a little makeup, then I'll wear a sweater and a clean dress, and a fancy car.

Damn, I found a mouse in the closet under my clothes.

It's not important what people say.
He wants to ruin our garden.
It's not unreasonable for us to expect something according to our capabilities and circumstances.
You know that some people have taken loans and others have sold their houses and cars just to have a lavish wedding and people won't talk about it.
You just need to get out of the situation and it's enough with the wallet that I wanted to embarrass myself with.
You said that the manager was impressed with the Chinese and took it home.
Zain Dam, the bride's family said, "You choose the hall and the decorations and prepare everything so that I can be proud of you."
And hopefully we will choose whatever we want.
It doesn't mean anything, but I'm just saying the shop we went to last night – it had really reasonable prices.

And what is the price of the couch with the accessories?
Hello to you, yes but not from five hundred and twenty thousand
Ugh, ugh, we don't have enough money for everything fancy and good. It's all expensive.
Everyone does it like this.
Sorry, I don't understand.
What are the names
What do you like about this?
This is Noah's ship
We used to cherish them, grandmothers, but a Noah's Ark couch is worth twenty thousand.
And what does God have to do with my parents? I'm saying a luxurious wedding and it's really much better, honestly.
Shut up, you're not my father, Noah's boat.
This is weddings and this is the costs, you know we are average people
It means we need a hall with 50,000 square feet and 150,000 square feet, the one you booked – the Royal Hall, as you call it.
We didn't say magicians, but I'm laughing at the appearances, and everyone wants to look better than the other, and everyone wants to do better than what the other has done.
The appearances are just a show that only the owners of wedding halls benefit from.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit us and take advantage of us.
I know a friend who says his brother has a wedding hall.
The couch doesn't cost two thousand reals.
Don't you dare say that! I didn't approve of God, her father. May he be blessed.
Damn, he messed up.
Just like you have done before, young men and women marry and start families.
Hello, my dear aunt.
How are you?
I know you love excellence.
And that's why I'm always lying.
For the first time, Qatar is coming with a design by the world-renowned artist Peter Salmo

Harmony, we're never the first women in Qatar to use nine planets.
Damn it.
She was fifty-two and now.
It's just that.
God will reassure you.
Your eyes are precious.
These are a lot of expenses, and you're my brother.
Generally, I didn't manage to find all eighty of them.
All I managed to take was sixty thousand and twenty thousand. I took them from my brother.
You shouldn't have bothered, you shouldn't have bothered at all, my friend, my falcon.
Oh, my falcon, oh, my falcon, keep your eyes on me as long as we celebrate and appear splendid at the wedding; we are in a golden age.
Without ostentation, without embellishment
Your cards will definitely arrive.
I inshallah, this episode we're going to start with the cards.
If our wedding isn't better than theirs
Hey, about the invitations that your daughter is making for the wedding.
Seriously, where is he living?
People these days are traveling countries just to get wedding cards.
My house, Amina's, we went to Italy, they designed the cards and printed them, and Ya and Amina's house.
They're going to France, even people who don't have a lot of money are going to Lebanon, going to Lebanon and bringing their cards.
After the country, it doesn't matter to us that we violate it.
Why are you guys traveling to which country, hopefully?
We lost a lot of really awesome cards.
It’s really expensive, but.
But it’s unique and no one has done it before us.
It's not sweet.
I'm saying gold looks better when polished.
Man, it's awful that he can't afford the wedding expenses.
He's a complete idiot, messing with himself.
And leave us this nonsense and blabbering at the wedding and the useless chaos.
And no one benefits from the psychological clinic except these hotels and wedding halls.
Aco, he is poor.
Let me go get him, it might be wrong, maybe I won't find anyone who wants to take him.
Welcome, let's connect.
Shorten it, Nasser.
Man, the relatives of the bride after the procession stand with you.
I was once, but only once.
I mean, it doesn't have to be a huge hotel ballroom like that.
My daughter is found in the street and others are not as good as her.
This is the problem everyone is looking at everyone else.
Who told you that I married?
At least some people don't have this kind of stupidity.
It’s a simple party and expenses are as you can afford.
And then come, man, these days people are throwing wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheapest and most affordable
Do you not mean your country?
Forget my appearance

If I don't get the gift for my son Abdullah's wedding, I'll be upset or I'll be sad.

Okay, here's the translation: “Okay, sweetheart, you did great. Bye.”
Seriously, we agreed on DJ Ishle, not this change of reggae.

He's just like this, but I keep finding my brother Saleh breaking my heart and I don't want to pressure him.
It broke my heart a lot.
Wow!
When and where at the hospital?
My mother fell on us suddenly.
I heard this talk, before it falls on us.
He has nothing to say that needs to be waited for after he didn't prepare everything, and people are saying they don't want a wedding.
Let's crash it.
How much is the doctor saying?
My dear sister, he's trying to cancel the wedding.
Inshallah, everything will be good.
Don't burn her heart.
Baby, you're a man, and you're the one who brings the money.

"By God, if he says this about my brother Youssef, his heart will stop."

You know, it's supposed that he retired about three or four years ago.
There's nothing that helps me.

You understand that I'm not happy with him now.
And let him go through the papers and statements until you return the money.
This is its name: deferred cooling overruns.

Hey baby Fatima, I want to talk to you.
I'm worried about you, my son. They'll be jealous if you beat them tomorrow like this in the pashmina.
Hey, his shirt is really nice.
The police are waiting.
Make it good.
Six dashes into you, stay here with me.
May God punish you, Salou.
Your wedding is calling.
The marital cage is now a prison cage.
And discover the papers I had for the loan, oh my God, now they've spoken up and they're arresting me.
Why are you bothering yourself?
You'll hear bigger troubles than this.
We came to say
Respectful and loyal employee
The Ministry of Works contracted a company to carry out maintenance.
The employee, out of his care for his work, inquired about the materials.
I met her for 4000 reals.
It has the ministry one million and six hundred thousand.
The minister is going to punish him, lalala, I didn't believe this would happen.
Why didn't you donate?
This is Ahmed Saad وصل
He definitely has the full news.
Drained from work
What's happening in the world and what are the values?
He says to call his office manager.
He said it as a substitute for Ottoman rubble.

The manager's daughter of the same company presented a maintenance proposal.
And Osman exposed them
La la la, it's not reasonable.
You're all surprised, Saleh.
The company with him
To whom
We’ve reached the point
What do you say?
He is so confused about this Schalol, this poor employee Osman Ashdhunbeh.
His problem is that he is a trustworthy and loyal employee.
Ateeq is the current manager in his office.
Turns out his alarm went off last night.
How is the world?
We found strange shapes.
I'm with you, Osman. He doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it.
May God grant you a long life, he has seven children and he doesn't have a passport.
He's completely lost his job now, where is he going and what is he doing to himself?
I saw what happened.
The new employee who was appointed by the minister
The marsh of the Ottoman and Dawamat, and the poor Ottoman, wants to take his belongings and prevent him. She said to him, "Go, and I will send your belongings with the bedbug."
Where is he now?
The scales have turned, O Osman.
This is the last one.
God has power and done what He willed.
With God, and to God we put our trust.
God is the Most Gracious, O Osman. May God not let you, inshallah. May God be with you. Goodbye.
I hope your voice isn't strange.
I know, I know you're really sensitive.
I'm done with this, God, I don't have the energy to work anymore, I'm leaving.
And then I’ll visit my mom and go get her glasses.
I don't need you, why are you bothering me here?
What are you yelling at me for? You're my mom.
I am not shouting, I am asking you.
She's a normal, ordinary woman, your wife can ride with her, your older brother.
The world has changed and how are you living?
Please tell me, mom.
You guys are crazy.
People have been liberated. The world has become a small village. Where are you living?
But Shaquille
Don't dawdle, and live life—don't lag behind the group.
Come down quickly, please. Let me stop you from crying, you're always showing up, be quiet properly.
May God protect you, Saleh, how are you?
You don't look well today.
And I shouted at the maid, who was innocent.
You know, it was forced upon me, I swear to God.
Goodnight, my money. Same.
So I can forget the troubles I've been through
My love, there's no end.
Dad is grilling today, I'm so excited.
It’s a pleasure meeting you.
Thank you, thank you, you didn't fail.
Work hard and diligently and persistently.
Correct, wonderful!
The most important thing
The most important thing for me in this ministry is
May you live long, dear.
Tell me the benefit of an employee who doesn't take bribes.
It's useless.
Because of that, I want all of you.
There is no place for the redeemers, principles, and values of ballet here.
I if I discover one day
I don't blame myself.
We don't take blame or criticism.
That’s why I want you to collaborate with me.
But I doubt it
Tell me right away.
thieves and the sons of thieves and of course our relatives, they don't need anything extra
Nourah, if I don't take a bribe for one day, I'll be kicked out and the government will be ruined, seriously.
Mashallah, mashallah, you're amazing! This is the mamoul from you all. I don't want it, but I want you all to make it like this.
May God bless you.
That’s why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Honestly, I knew how to choose, I chose the right thief for the right place.
Please, Umm Saud, please don't torture me anymore.
I don't want you to go to jail.
But my reckoning with Satan is he who tormented me and granted me the trust.
And he told me to be the treasurer.
You are a man with sons.
Tell me with honesty and integrity.
You've been a thief your whole life and comfortable with it.
Well, I'm not noble anymore.
Let me chat with my dad.
Please repeat it again.
A man is walking while his master is insulting him, and he is disagreeing and not living comfortably.
My dad is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Sorry, sorry
This is a scarf you wear.
We are a respectable family.
It's so wrong of you.
Where is Bengi?
It's not transparent.
You shouldn't be shy, you have no shame.
I'm embarrassed to wear this with my brother.
She's so embarrassed these days.
How are you shouting?
Jufi bentj ashlabse
In a respectable person wearing this outfit.
Hopefully you’ll walk down the street without anyone noticing anything about your body.
She doesn't listen to me, she's ignoring me.
I'm not neglecting her.
I'm bringing her those sheer clothes that don't need
Be careful if you ever see me wearing something under my knee.
Let him be excused who warns.
We, God willing, are coming.
Inshallah, just saliva and my sweat.
Looked at his father
It is empty before you.
Honestly, what a great guy. Where can we find someone like him?
I don't fear my uncle, I am black-skinned.
And yes, the Saudi Riyal, honestly, my daughter Sarah is the most precious to me and I care deeply about her future.
Do you hear about it?
Praise be to God. Mashallah, I heard it was terrible.
I go into the house at three thirty in the evening.
Wahy is doing well, praise be to God, he's getting up at 5 AM.
Yo yo what's up
Take me home from the bar
Give me a jump start for your car and come take me from the bar
I'm seeing for the first time a father who doesn't listen to his child's words.
Ya Allah, ya babi, about the movements, it's a job, turn on your car. Ya Allah, I'm waiting for you.
Merry I love you
I left you too. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm gone.
Basically, my father is my dad, he's here.
Where are you?
Damn, my father's car is ruined, don't give it.
Let me introduce you to Boy Friend Money Majid
Abdulaziz doesn't like that boy friend before.
Let's go, let's go. Let's go, it's an opportunity for weed.
And the Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians haven't trimmed their nails.
According to what Palestine committed to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Generally, the United Nations is meeting today to consider Israel's request to send a special team to inspect Palestinian territories.
If their nails are long, or not.
There was a condition that nothing should irritate or bleed in Palestine.
These are the State of Palestine
I call upon the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make it from cork.
The Zatanat, you guy.
Squeezing the dates like this, like squeezing the dates.
Our Arab brothers and sisters demand the international community.
An inspection of Palestinian fingernails makes a difference.
And we begin voting.
What have you achieved?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salah Salah, how are you?
I dreamt of Abshno.
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Ya Rashid, lazem titkawn shakhsiyatik qawiyyah.
Now, bro, what's the number for this school I'm going to tomorrow?
I am like you, a teacher.
I haven't changed my school since I started teaching.
Any character, bro.
The problem is that his personality is weak.
As a thought, the teachers who are with him are the ones who objected to him.
Seriously, man.
I see him silent.
After he explained
He just wrote mayonnaise.
Hey, we're not saying this to make you upset.
We're telling you this because this is the last chance.
He told me that I accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak.
And wonderful and good beyond measure.
No matter what, he's a country boy.
Why are you silent now, my friend?
So that everything you say is correct.
Your words are all correct.
I hate you
Professor Rashid Al-Yayed
Mr. Rashid
May God protect you.
Forget the solution.
And hatred
This is how it is and then
I'm telling you.
I am a teacher who hates mistakes.
Imagine you told a boy that what he said was just like what the boy said at elementary school and the inspector is watching.
Take your bag.
Grill grill broke the door
One learns from their mistakes.
From the first minute
I am telling you.
I am nervous.
How are you?
Wait a minute
Janna said, "Shut up nicely."
I heard you.
Professor Rashid expelled me.
Wow, paradise he said, "Ya Allah, that's good." But I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, what did a boy from the desert know?
Born from
There's a professor Rashid coming.
How are you doing?
Teacher, I'm upset if his father says something.
Seriously, you guys are a habit in the opportunity, where can I find you in advance, sitting
It can be found near the chairs.
Above the chairs
The chairs chairs long
And man, in the end, is human, meaning...
You completely blew up at me.
A quarter and you overwhelm me, you overwhelm me.
My dad is leaving today, and I'll tell him when he comes back next week.
Lalala Abdul Rahman and I kiss you.
We we, that's a lot of blueberry ice cream, it's really good. You might not have tried it yet, it's really awesome.
Oh God, hurry and get her quickly.
All he's afraid of is telling his father.
You didn't say that your father travels.
I just traveled, my father is gone, my father means they took his head. They told him to travel, he went.
Please God, let's just hope so, please God.
And take your bag and your shoes with you, and give me your phone number and let me know if you need anything, I'm your friend's.
Oh, just.
What's up
You are the ones who told me.
Loud and pretend to be strong.
Bathroom bathroom bathroom

That’s why I’m gathering you all so I can hear your ideas for the party.

Hey man, the sugar is melting, seriously.

Peace be upon you.
Inspector's rise, sitting.
Yes, please.
Teacher, come, come, teacher
I’m really upset.
What are you talking about, man? I'm asking, did you finish talking?
Did you finish it or didn't you? Where is the teacher's dignity? You're mocking yourself. You're insulting the profession of teaching.
Okay, here's the translation: Okay, okay, that's it, that's it.
Lower your voice too
I'm raising my voice, you first. I'm the first to know this kid is from...

I'm a little Arab, my dad wants four, four, five cars, big big, God, wide, big big, go go go.
To be the owner of the neighborhood like this
Abu Naser did that and didn’t do that.
May it be easy for him.
I am the manager here.
It is known as a leader.
He was giving all the teachers supplementary lessons.
I am
From the manager, I am greeting.
You are the manager, God bless you, I’m relying on you.
Riel fell.
You've put it on your head, on the chair, man.
What does six mean?
There's no need, truly, truly. Honestly, I want to ease your burden.
What's up?
You're the last one with me now.
Respect yourself better, and you'll have to take extra classes whether you like it or not. I've agreed anyway, how are you?
Then with you, you, you, look and see
Inshallah, let's go out.
As we told you, son of a man.
I need to stop him at his limit.
Hold on, guys, hold on.
Don't blame us, my brother Salem.
Boneauive, you're a big shot, and you need to be stopped.
I am my father's son.
I I am showing you I am
Faster, faster
May you be safe and well, farewell.
MashaAllah, when is the payment due after buying this new car?
You wronged me, the one you didn't believe in.
His beard and face have become red.
I was given a donation once, when someone came to visit me. I didn't know it until I heard his voice.
You know that from what they told us, they escaped?
He is responsible for eight boys' and girls' schools.
Ashal-sir al-sihri kh ayqulak shal-sir illi antshillah min al-qaa’
I'm telling you from the very first day.
I am explaining what I hear or sound.
And we do not
Respect yourself.
After I reply to you, I will go out. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
First, they'll announce your appointment as a minister immediately. I'll look for a good job for you.
Seriously, what is this? Don't tell me to come and take this job.
The girl doesn't bother to give me choices for these jobs and I choose the most suitable one.
My brother, the minister
I haven't felt comfortable with the calls I've been getting.
Mashallah, everyone blesses it.
They're saying, "Oh my God, it's awful."
This is a normal thing, every minister does what his friends and associates do automatically.
Regarding this, can you reassure me that Dont and Nice to Meet You have seen the SI in?
We know, of course that I'm becoming a minister.
Vereshchinsky paint
The best treasure is the treasure that opens itself to us.
Thank you.
Oh my God, everyone is going to the competition for the new minister.
Ya Allah, Ya Allah, Ya Allah
Congratulations, Minister's efforts
Congratulations, may God bless you.
Congratulations, Minister's time, you deserve it.
You deserve it, dear Minister.
My brothers, the responsibility is great, God willing, we will be able to bear it.
And, as they say, fate chose his family.
You came out saying I should call Bassal's phone.
It was far away, grilled.
Don't bother with him.
That love that fell on it once
Web Sultan is not easy.
I mean, yes, the car door is closed.
You did a great job!
We're waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told my mom, you're the one who didn't believe me.
You're telling me, man, coffee, man, coffee.
After he died, his brother told me that I was the one he was fighting.
May God protect us. May God protect us.
Like, what do you have to say? You have nothing to tell me?
Girl, guys, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Do you mean someone has a problem?
Relax, ladies.
I just went to see them perform because they were annoying me.
They have the right too.
But I didn't want to say this in front of my mom, you know my mom would expose us.
Spread anything you hear, it's called the scandal, we don't want the disgrace.
Are you crazy? They'll kill you if they take you, they'll put you in your place.
Because I asked
If you're deleted, you'll be the first candidate.
Seriously, they wouldn't even let you in, they're going to remove you.
I'm not sure about this.
You’re so beautiful, seeing you carry yourself like you see me in front of you now.
Do some magic for him.
But the plan I have is solid and effective.
Burn and drought plan
Make him ban all activity that happens in the country.
At that moment, he was burning, and when the burning came, the choking came, and when the choking came, I brought the shawl.
Oh my friend, I don't know how I didn't know what to say to you.
Your soul is called sharing, reflecting the extent of your love for the country.
You've been acting strange like this.
You are a man of state today, you must be in the picture.
I need to contribute to everything. Long-term forgiveness. Forgiveness, forgiveness.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Oh, may you live long! This is just a simple sheep, you know, not worth your attention. Oh, may you live long! You're going with me today?
The rial is waiting for you.
You know, honestly
I don't feel like going.
I’m tired of pretending. I’m tired.
You are the minister today, adjusted your words and as you said you are a listener, like your whole life.
God will surely make this good real work for you.
You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.
I can't imagine it.
Aht Aht
Today I took him to an evening and a wedding, if he doesn't accept, he'll accept with a thousand apologies.
I just brought you something nice, I want you to take it there.
Listen, I've prepared a really cool educational activity for you.
Like, just let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it's polished. I'm looking for this shine.
Thank you, congratulations, congratulations, cycle of blessings, may it be blessed, photos, photos, the Minister's efforts, he gave photos, he gave photos, I don't, I don't, I don't give.
This cycle
Congratulations, may it be blessed, congratulations, double congratulations, the Minister's efforts.
Image after image, she’s getting thicker and thicker, you’re wasting your life.
Nothing, God bless you.
Stay on page two.
No, I don't know it.
National sharing
Remember God
This is the fourth time today one of my friends has called me.
Everyone praises your activities. And Khaled has nominated you as a moving social activist.
Yesterday I heard a word that hurt me.
Yesterday, the party that took me with Bulsultan.
Kindergarten Swim Competition Party
One person is saying something about his friend.
They say I don't hear them.
He says the minister.
My father is buying a birthday gift for my sister's son.
Hello, hello
I will be inside the newspaper every day, Dad.
Yeah, yeah
This is Mahalle, how are you? You're so bright, Dad. This is Snow, I want to do something for Dad.
It's your money, you pay the money, there's no problem.
Damn, what's the meaning of this? Why isn't your minister going to be investigated and implicated?
Ana Ana Bouslah El-Wazir
Please don't waste my time for something like this. I'm waiting for you there.
And he made me sit in the first grade and he goes to his car to rest.
I don't want anything from him, God is calming me.
Oh, my dear, listen to me for a bit, I need to talk to you to make sure.
And from yourself, you have begun to call.
People are giving us discounts.
He told me.
That's really cool.
I came back to tell you
This minister is reciting the call to prayer, O God, O God, bless him.
Welcome, Minister.
No way, I'm really tired today and
Okay, let's translate this. If you have that kind of enthusiasm, go ahead and do it, Sam.
Go ahead and go with your brother Saad, and he'll look for you, God willing, if he finds you a party.
Hey, party!
Good night today we don't have any activity.
No way, there isn't.
Where can I get a boy?
Thank you, thank you.
I'm saying no one is asking me.
May God grant you success.
I'm telling you, rest and relax.
Moment of happiness
I'll do anything, God willing.
What a beauty
It can be after an hour.
This is all that happened in the cabin and inside, just filmed and he let him describe how much it is on his face and just a few pictures.
Okay, here's the translation: Ya Allah, good. Ya Allah, goodbye.
He was burned.
Please tell me about a match in the reserve league, hopefully I'll be playing on the field.
This minister has decided upon us.
It's great that the peak arrived.
The end is near, since people's talk has become like this.
May God grant you a long life, he's now months older than you.
Long time ago, if you go somewhere and take my blessing with you.
May you live long.
Shining star
Let's reduce the volume and return it to normal size.
Wash, wash, wash, the minister arrived, wash, wash, wash, the minister arrived.
I can't imagine, I can't imagine, God willing if someone in you breaks me, I'm not coming down.
Brooke, break cameras, I don't want to shoot.
Greetings to you, my dear.
And like they say, I missed the train.
This is my brother’s name.
No power or strength is from Allah but by His will.
Why is that?
This is the first time I've seen him.
It's the first time I've seen them.
It's the first time I've seen him in ages.
Wayy
This is my eternity.
I've been looking for you, come here my love, come here
What are we used to?
Ugh, no power or strength except by God. You're responding to the same thing.
Come out, I'm telling you, come out and stop blowing up my phone. My soul is returning from the wedding at 9 am.
Just let me relax, this hasn't happened before.
Your brother is a boy.
I swear, I can't say the truth about my father, what he's done is that you've become like a daughter.
He was playing, playing.
He was playing, I told you, makeup Qutay, and he was playing with it.
But this is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Khaled and upon him, may all the children be like him.
On all these ads and nonsense he puts out about his brothers
Hello, my loves, come say hello.
Hey loves, how are you?
I’m not ready, we’re going to Spain this summer.
I'm asking you
The Falcons of Kuwait
Hello Hameed.
Listen to me, I'm telling you
There is no power nor strength except through God, the Most Mighty, the Most Great.
Let her, my beloved, be the one who chooses.
Seriously, what's up?
I'm saying the things by the sea are the best.
Ikon Line will be available soon, we’ve bought a yacht to go from our house to the beach every time.
We and our kids
Oh my God, please schedule the wedding!
It's almost Hant, all in one year and a month waited.
What perfume is your brother wearing, a lot of it?
I mean, honestly, I've noticed Khaled, his brother, I don't know how.
But it’s really different from your brother Saad.
He came back and he's acting like everyone, oh my god, he's being reckless.
Then your preacher is a degenerate who doesn't know there are unisex perfumes.
I'm telling my fiancé to keep his medicine for himself.
I don't care
Khalid didn't believe it.
You're not just your perfumes like women.
You're even using their colors
Why are you doing that, Khaled?
Oh, seriously, what's up?
Hey, why aren't you showing up to stop him? You're not even noticing his moves and actions.
These times are for perfumes for both
They listened to me as if I warned you.
You guys saw Bluetooth?
Listen to the quarter isolphon in the mills, they say it's spreading in Doha.
I heard about it, you know.
You guys messed it up and then told me about it.
Oh, my God, how do you dance?
Bl bl bl bl of movements
These are the girls from the area who are talking about who are dancing well and doing moves that she knows, who is this, this is Khulood, Muhammad's cousin.
My uncle's dog's money.
But here I will show you it
Wait for your brother Saad.
Let him come in while I tell you to let him in. Saad will send him the Bluetooth so that he can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you. Hello. Hello.
Defeated for sure
His cousin is hollow and sitting outside.
No, it's not just me, but I'm telling you your Bluetooth is open.
No, I'm sending you something.
Thank you, Sheikh/Sheikhah.
I lost my way from my parents.
You, my dear, are lucky.
And I'm traveling tomorrow.
I won’t find anyone in the country.
Where are you hitting your heads, where are you hitting your heads
And people say
They say your son is their safety net, and you're about to cause us a scandal.
Wow!
My son is so well-behaved, it's a source of pride and joy.
Real Qalb Umuh Marr Faziha
My brother-in-law said this is my daughters' brother.
Tell me, does he travel to treat, does he study, does he work, does he commit suicide, anything?
It’s important that I don’t live in a place where shame pursues me every day.
You came where are you going
With the spirit of fifty centuries
This is the end.
I don't know where to find it, and I put his bag, he's going to travel.
Even I don't know where it wants to go.
I broke down. Do you think something will happen?
Are you okay now? I'm worried about you because it hurts me when you leave me alone, my love.
I'm telling you, pay attention to it.
I won’t let him be used for service.
You didn’t know about it, did you?
My mom isn't at work and she's leaving the responsibility with you.
Damn it, man!
There's no hope because of your sister.
In this, you have a right.
Whoever is different from us is eternal, and we have a place among people.
I cannot help anyone.
You killed him.
This is my dad’s biggest mistake.
We are in the shadow of the asphalt of the damned eternity.
I didn't do anything to him.
On CD and give it to him
And while I'm going to the airport
I'm really worried about him.
My house needs to be at that level or better, Amen.
Don't be surprised.
Khalud washkalahu ma atahhumu sum’uh ahlihim
Listen to your brothers and sisters.
No matter how religious values called them
They were dancing and rejoicing.
In the alley
I swear to God, my father, you're driving me crazy.
Goodbye, my son.
Be careful with yourself, my son.
Seriously, what do you want from me, dude?
A gift to me, please.
Now I've put the CD in the laptop, I'm scared of what's going to happen, I'm going with it.
Oh my God, Mom.
Seriously, Mom, my dad still thinks the CD is the whole thing, and it only lasts three minutes.
can be retrieved
Where is it coming from? Where can it go?
Reply to how are you, my brother Saad.
Damn it.
It's okay, Amal.
If I go out, I do it with exhaustion and effort.
In order to find someone who will judge your morals.
But forgive me.
May God guide you.
I'm looking for you guys, you guys came out in the open.
My love
We are in the age of freedoms
Age of Man and none of us have anything here
Whoever has rials takes ten, my dear eye.
Of course, this might be a lot of talk, God bless America, my love.
The rain is falling heavily.

May God punish you, and you who stopped with Adryol, I asked about you.
Mom, I'm really feeling overwhelmed.
He’s complaining about his salary, it’s useless, they’re dealing with him for 700, he got his license and increased it by a little, I’m telling you.
He gave me a raise to complete my year.
This guy looks greedy and he's going to mess us up.
Just you, just you, just you, you're the best, you're the best, relax, relax, relax and leave him alone.
This word is easy. It's easy.
It makes me want to hate driving with him.
Just leave it.
You guys just told me the story. I'm a house guy, I'm going to keep quiet. You're done too, you stopped. Just the one who's acting.
Go Ana, get out.
Come, let me stop.
I don't know what you're saying.
Rafeeq is saying, "What are you not seeing inside the room?" He's asking if you don't say anything.
Dad, this is where there's no companion. This is in the old house, I'm the brother of my father's brother.
Okay, five minutes inshallah in Rome.
Five minutes
It's inside your head, how are you doing?

Everything inside the world of Hinn is expensive.
After a few months, he will give eighty.
Dad, I'm really stuck in a problem within the country.
This is a driver inside Doha in Qatar and I need the full million, the full two million.
In bad may be in bad three hundred above mail papa
I'm waiting for a thought.
Look, I've reached 100 percent already. Stop it. There's no more increase.
You're just saying words and wasting time, how can you increase your job?
It's not
I am saying you are right.
Waste of water, it won't help.
Two hundred, it's useless.
I am afraid.
It's not a coronavirus.
It's hard to say
Easy scale three thousand four hundred
It's a stupid problem inside a house, it's useless outside, a lot of money.
I am feeling afraid.
This is all I know
How many
Two five hundred
In the fear of this police, I am imprisoned.
No, there's no COVID.
I'm going to buy your car.
I'm telling you, I'm wearing my dress and going out.
No one responded to me.
The hero left his room except the basement was empty.
Amenireh was staring at a broken year.
I’ll leave it to God to punish him.
Okay, I'm coming to see you.
I went to the police and reported it.
Enough is enough, since you're the one who reached the age, you have no responsibility.
We definitely won't let you down.
And after you turned in the neighborhood from me, maybe you'll see my response, notify us.
What's the best way to get money, a full stomach goes to surrender itself.
I wish they lose on me, I’ll wear them, I’ll eat them, their driving practice.
It's complicated.
Match starts now, do do enter best
Was I scared to tell you?
These are the Foxes team, and the Foxes won't get anywhere without their hard work.
Find out if more than three are registered, that means we didn't win, we need ten fifteen.
Obvious mockery. Let's be clear, obvious mockery.
If this level doesn't bring more than three, it's not the team of foxes.
I'm telling you, take it.
In the soul and the player and the performance
He has nothing to thank God for if they come out in less than three. They should thank God.
These upcoming plans of our team are still called the Foxes team and they're annoying us, man.
You scored a comfortable goal for Stuttgart now.
I expect after in sayings and or finished on gi
This is Thaleb Wa Jed, very good. This is in your mind, he is from me, from me, there is no generosity from you. You are in a director's position, you are a capitalist. This is Thaleb, who eats chicken.
Bye, I don't have a car.
You are a friend of money.
You didn't hear him say anything.
He's saying this guy is a real problem.
You are in good condition, nothing can harm you.
Yes, sir.
You don't know what, do you?
This is a tricky one!
It pops up sometimes on talk shows
You will overcome the day.
"By God, it's amazing and overwhelming. You are the Thalb team, there's no defeat at all, you're always winning."
What does a fox say about today's result?
What does this result mean?
Class result for foxes
This guy is coming to get his livelihood, he's going to make a tire.
Let's be realistic, you know? And please, don't say the foxes won and flew away.

Hello, are Bedouin Arabs present?
You are in Za'faraan.
You don't deserve a team that I have, you are its leader.

I would like to receive a map of the third team.

May God protect us.
Mommy, mommy, mommy
Now, my dad is doing something with us, we don't know what.
I didn't mean it, sweetheart.
Please, don't say that about my father.
My dad is turning over our house.
He's definitely going to kill you right now.
Seriously, man, I'm not breaking it with my salary.
Hey mom, why don't we go to Ainab? Let's stick it and glue it.
She was wearing a bra.
Where can we find one like it? I don't know, where did your uncle get it from? Where are you getting it from? It's a gift.
I'm scared of him for you.
Ugh, I'm scared my dad will beat me.
I knocked on the door so that you can see a solution to this issue.
Ya Allah, hurry up, go to your room.
Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa, you are grandpa.
My grandfather broke the vase.
Hey Waleed, we miss you.
No, mama, what happened to you?
He smashed my house, damn it, scared of his father.
Don't be lustful, my love, fear God in youth.
Mom, this isn't upbringing. God, you're calming me down.
What should I do now, man?
I don't know how to act.
My mother is just afraid for him from the cars in the street.
Allah yihafflehu inshallah. Ana a'qool mumkin raah el-dukkaan aw raah beet el-jeeran yaleeb ma' el-yahal.
I love you, Waleed, you're sweet and good, and I love you, Mom.
Bye mama, seek refuge in Allah from Satan and don't worry, Inshallah, everything will be good.
Okay, here's the translation: Ya Allah, my mother, excuse me.
Where is Walid?
My dad is hitting me.
My dad is going to kill me with this ritual.
I don't fear you, my eye's light.
I'm not afraid, my love.
I won’t let it reach out to you.
I broke down in tears.
Come on, Yabo, come drink some sweet milk and relax in my room.
The light has turned yellow.
May God guide him, but may God guide him. Come on, my love, come on.
Oh Lord, O generous One.
I'm scared my dad is coming here.
Seriously, dude, don't be like that.
No one who interferes with my child's upbringing
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I see fit.
But it's a shame the boy is trembling, terrified of something, his father's friend.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let me open it
The bag fell on the vase. Believe me, he didn't mean to.
You have to defend it.
You're not telling him anything for my sake, please forgive him this once. The boy breaks hearts out of fear.
Where is he? Where is he now? Where is he sitting with you at this time?
We don't have it.
Existing where?
Take a shower inside
My brother took my Lala today.
Okay, Jan is alone except for elementary school.
Ya Allah, we're filming, man, we want to play.

Seriously, just this game and we're going to study.
Why don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Oh my god
Seriously, get lost, don't ruin our lives.
Soul, come on, it's over, don't get involved. Soul, go, soul, let's study.
What is this talk? What is this talk? What is this talk?
If you don't do it now, your brother Waleed will call your uncle.
Don't say my uncle's right. Don't say my uncle's right. Don't say my uncle's right.
Nothing from you, I have nothing to say.
I told him what you heard.
Ya Allah, I'm looking at everyone going to take their book and study it.
Seriously, put your phone away in your bag, let's study. Seriously, don't tell my uncle.
God willing, Mom, I'm confused and don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he causes us a problem.
I'm sure you're asking me when I'm going to the hospital.
So what's the problem that you told him about?
If he knows that Walid Eyub is in his bed, he will kill him.
Mom, she's the reason for everything, she's to blame.
Mom, this is a psychological area.
The boy is not a little boy anymore, now he is twelve years old.
Seriously, babe.
Let's eat at Tioon, seriously. I, yo, in the blink of an eye.

Yo, hijab and need.

I’m my son, Ibol, every night in my bed and you don’t tell me what’s happening.
I need to take him to the hospital to treat him.

Please don't give them to your brother.

These are my children.
Seriously, uncle, uncle, last time
Why don't I come from fifty of fifty of fifty?
Zadeh alone
I tell him he won't go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital, they admitted him. He said they told him not to enter, he said he's fine, what does it matter?
You're being unreasonable, don't come with us.
Just when I call my brothers
Oh, grandpa, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying. Grandpa, last time, I'm dying.
Let me go to hell.
Watch out, this isn't the deal you'll find at the end of the year if one of you doesn't bring fifty.

Professor Ahwah is afraid of his father because his father wants him to bring fifty out of fifty.
You, my son, I'm not talking to you.
Connect, connect, message the guy who's in the class with you.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call her, call her. She can go to her mother's house.
No, they don't have it.
Damn, where is this going? Where is it going?
No power or strength is from Allah but by His will.
Man, that's a really old-timer.
Seriously, he fell and is scared of his family.
Oh my God, how did you guide him to be the best student after the first one?
He's just afraid of going and being accused.
It's only off by two degrees in mathematics.
May God have mercy on him.

Come on, Waleed.
Eighty-four ninety-four minus two degrees, nothing to say about it, it didn't hit you like a child.
Peace be upon you and blessings of God.
Nuclear energy
That represents sixty percent of the world’s oil reserves.
The United Kingdom tops the global reserve with 42 percent.
Then Libya and the United States and Nigeria
Three-hundredths of each of them, and the rest of the world is combined at fifteen-hundredths of a percent.
And then
And from production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the rush to this region and its countries from the major industrial countries.
At the top is the United States of America, the world’s first consumer of oil energy.
However, oil prices are continuously rising.
In sync with a decline in the US dollar
The UAE is taking a leading role in setting oil prices.
Where did the price of a barrel reach yesterday?
This led to an increase in the income of producing countries and at the same time
To increase inflation in it
Inflation in some of those countries has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
In the prices of life and goods
That was in a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister.
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Athaye
For those who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program’s numbers and phone numbers.
Welcome, Deputy.
I would like to start with you about the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where can prices go?
Of course, where can one go with prices? This is a perplexing question.
Or what is called the market force
OPEC is not.
And the producing countries are not
The producing countries are not the producing countries and OPEC has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is it just the relationship between the price between supply and demand?
It's not even the dawn and the request isn't, it doesn't have a big impact.
What are the factors if
In other factors, in addition to the supply and demand
What for investors
They were subjected to immense pressure and turned to oil and gold, or what is known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in the stock markets.
And gold too
Rayna Rayna Gold rose from $135 in recent years to now $770
As of today, just like I mentioned, around one hundred and ninety-nine dollars.
But all of it is in the increase and if it decreased slightly.
I'm reminding you that in the first quarter of this year
The analysts expect the second quarter to see prices decline due to low oil demand.
But the market opinion is in a strange and fluctuating state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises to above one hundred dollars.
But, essentially, that means the previous factors that determined price increases relative to winter and consumption have now changed, and there are now other factors.
and economic growth
And at the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
I spoke about the political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Would Iran expect the resignation of Fallon amid the political complexities?
Its owner and today topped most American newspapers and global media outlets that could affect oil prices.
I'm in the water, yes today yes
Today we are in the age of globalization and influence comes quickly.
Illusory factors can affect
And they create a kind of disturbance in the market
Rumors of a political conspiracy are spreading.
He said there is no plan, but he did not rule out other options as well that could be considered regarding Iran.
The Qumou always interacts with the markets.
Of course, at the moment it is not certain that the United States is at war with Iran.
I am one of the people who the alpha that doesn't mean sees this scenario.
Falcon will be, and there may be things we haven't seen. What will it be like in the future?
But we are the ones who work in the crisis sector.
We see that all this political tension
The oil supplies in the world
And conversely, there are very comfortable supplies.
What does it indicate if there is oil going into storage?
There has never been a shortage in oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the coming war
Despite this calm picture you are painting about the supply and that there are no obstacles to the supply
In the event that the U.S. President Bush and the United States decided to implement their plan
This is something else.
Prices will rise to levels of figures and standards.
Oil prices may rise to
From the world’s oil reserves
You are here this here for today the Gulf represents the most important
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries
They represent more than sixty percent of the oil reserves, so it is definitely important.
You are today
If a very minor accident occurs
Therefore, it indicates
That means that in the event of any war against Iran, the price of oil cannot be guaranteed to any extent it can rise.
God knows, and today we arrived without
Wars to one hundred and seven dollars, one hundred and ten dollars, and may it jump to one hundred and ten dollars, God knows.
Today, oil is like I told you, it lives under psychological and political tensions.
The insurgents and the armed groups withdrew.
Oil-based investment
Or what is called, it's not an investment, of course, a real investment, no, it's future purchase or futures marketing.
It is called oil paper.
And these are all smears on oil paper.
His production is approximately three hundred thousand barrels, or less.
They may push them to buy more and then to buy even more.
I hope it's April Fool's Day.
I hope there isn't
Jenny is coming to the area and it is said that this is on her main agenda.
Jilly is the owner of this project, as many politicians and journalists have said.
I didn't know what was in my bag.
I can't predict what it will mean.
Will he ignite a war?
The United States is in a transitional phase.
And why doesn't the son do anything else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. Because April is very close, just a few weeks away, and we will enter April.
And the world may pay.
And America is a major consumer country.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You cannot call this number.
Taka takalifuh al-intajiyah rakheesah.
Comparison of West African countries that are mostly based
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
We heard this talk from the one from the West and from the United States for many years.
excessive reliance
To the end, and the Caspian Sea war remembers the story
No matter how incredible these dreams may be
When you sit with close-knit people in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
What are they saying?
Regarding supplies, the importance of the area, and the importance of precautions.
When I asked one European official, I said it’s strange that you speak to us in the Hajj rooms, in closed rooms.
In a way that isn't the way you speak in front of people
Or the media said no, for these political reasons.
And of course, there’s something called the Dober Standard, or rather, two butts.
The fight that they are concerned about, they know its role is in the Gulf region.
It is important for Qatar and Saudi Arabia today, for example.
The world’s largest producer and exporter of oil.
And entering
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Rectangle
Could the war be against Iran?
Even with an aerial war or an aerial strike, as they say
For supplies
Are you guys not late? Are you coming now?
I don't agree with you, we are not in
And with the Westerners, we deal
With America, we deal.
What are the good prices?
Regardless of their gender, this market
Non-renewable energy means.
For (benevolence) in order to be generous
Arab generosity
Please give me.
Observers say that the real price of oil
And the reason is the rise in oil prices
You Gulf citizens and Obik and the countries
You are very kind to the Americans, and you insist on sticking to your currency.
You said that the price of oil should be two hundred dollars.
The real price is compared to the decrease of the dollar is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
Eighteen and nine, the dollar decreased by thirty-three percent.
Above one hundred dollars
If we take the percentage and proportion
They deny it.
The main reason is
Comparison with the decline of the dollar
If we take it, if we take it
If we take this comparison
The prices of oil
The United States of America
Of course, it is necessary to preserve the dollar now.
Weakness or recession in the American economy. The United States cannot list
So, so, what happened during this recession and stagnation?
You are also becoming it.
The United States is holding interest rates steady on the dollar.
Why do you insist on tying the price of oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is linked to the dollar.
First over one hundred years
First, the first barrel of oil was exported from the United States of America.
And issued in dollars
And since the beginning of the 20th century until today
Dollar pricing, oil pricing in dollars
Historically became
For fifty years, the whole world has been interacting and escalating.
And it is considered Norway today the third country producing oil.
And its source is oil.
Russia is the second largest oil-producing country.
And the production of the North Field sea in Europe
It is priced in dollars, not in
Everything is changing in the world. There are other sources and information pointing to something different than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is correct and there is no...
And these agreements
It relies on the fact that oil will remain the cover for the dollar, and that the United States will protect these systems.
This is not correct and there are no secret agreements.
Today let's take the WHO organization.
You have 66 percent of the effort of the deputy.
From thirteen states
Five eighty-eight barrels, forty percent of the OPEC share.
There are many large and very significant countries in oil production.
Outside of NATO
What are the obstacles that prevent working pricing?
Let me calculate the price another way.
Not everyone is right when they decide.
You are Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries.
Today is today, the Obik class for everyone.
There are sixty percent.
Even if they suppress it, the OPC organization wanted it.
There is an agreement between all oil-exporting countries to
Yes, there is a trend or intention for change.
The attempt
But now, the countries are not able to change the pricing currency to this extent.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of repetition?
Let me just talk now, about the Europeans.
Why don't they release their perfume?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway, in the Euro or the Ruble.
It’s in their interest to make them expensive and high and elevated.
Not reversed.
Here is their loss.
One barrel and a half
You're not the losers. You're the ones who lost because the product it's linked to the dollar decreased.
And it is a loss, also a huge loss.
The correlation of currencies here in the Gulf is historical.
Do you remember in the seventies the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And now you, when you talk about detachment
This is like marriage when you get married.
You're bringing about divorce. Divorce is not easy.
Here
You guys are messing around with a Casuliki with the dollar?
It should be studied in a way
To study professionally and to study with
And Kuwait has also dismantled 25% of its currency in dollars.
Saudi Arabia Bahrain United Arab Emirates Qatar
It may adjust the price of its currency
You're avoiding the topic, but that means you don't have the intention to study it or think about it.
The study differs, of course, Prime Minister said.
His Excellency stated that the national currency is undervalued, with a discount of two hundred percent.
If you enter from among those in this study
There's no direction for you to be the only ones dealing with this issue.
Kuwait isolated itself in response to Mazza's steps.
Economists say that it is profitable for countries and their people to break away from loss.
But we
There is nothing else.
The four Gulf countries announce
Everyone believes.
And I mean I am personally one of the people who support him.
She will support her.
You must be within this study.
By itself, by
Created states or two states
Until the time of the currency
You won’t create a situation.
This, of course, specialists will be studying it there.
And they will be the owners.
I'm not a political decision, I want a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush. Let's see what happens today.
People started
Of course, in a relaxed state.
The deputy is saying that inflation in Qatar reached 480% in 2007 and is expected to rise to 512% in the coming year.
They eat people's salaries and devour the salaries of the workers here.
People living in Qatar have seen their salaries increase by 32 to 40 percent.
We will return to you after a short break to let you know the size of the increases that will be made to salaries.
The employees in Qatar, at least in the next period, please stay with us.
Welcome back to Without Limits for this episode, in which we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
The Qatari industrialist Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Athayea discussed the alarming increase in prices.
Oil, which returned tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing nations.
Regarding oil and my question was about the expected increase in employee salaries, but before the increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has 79 and 8 billion out of 10 billion in reserves, and it has 2 and 6 from 10.
1 ton only and the report about Kuwait Times economic report returns of the Gulf countries are the largest
Saudi Arabia's revenues for the year 2008, projected to be 99 billion.
And she was
Seventy and two in the year last year the Emirates sixty six thousand, the year expected was seventy-five.
Kuwait was forty-six and sixty.
A single diameter of twenty barrels of oil, less than five hundred fifty billion.
From gas, as reports say, other things, please don't envy, I don't envy, oh, I don't envy, Mr. Deputy.
Iraq is 74 billion.
One and a half trillion
Areas of deficits were approximately $1.5 trillion.
The Gulf countries imported one trillion dollars, which is a quadrillion.
US dollars were multiple imports
The United States requests one billion.
and nine hundred million from ten billion
There were three in the Bahrain.
There was 17.5 in Oman, increasing to 18. There was 1157 in Qatar, increasing to 1580 in Qatar.
Those living in Qatar are facing more inflation, higher prices, and a more expensive life.
Life and prices have been swallowed up with high percentages, and more to come in Qatar.
We feel all sympathy for everyone.
Therefore, the two processors should be
And treatment means aiming to control the enlargement.
You will be increasing the salaries by fifty percent.
They're saying you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct and in...
Prime Minister against his deputy salaries
There is a problem and the solution should be the optimal one.
It is not a patch solution.
Well, there's a balance between the teeth.
And this is it.
Important, hey, treatment of hypertrophy
And here in Qatar in a committee
His Highness the Prince issued its formation.
and you place
Let's assume and place means rules
Powerful to solve the problem and control the expansion
The important thing is to control the swelling first.
Inflation
Yeah, if you don't control it.
May the Deputy succeed.
Specialized in market research and published at the end of February last month before any days
Between these about the entry of
Now you will deal with inflation and inflation will devour the income of these people.
Many of them are
Access to other countries
Zayd said our salaries, and then Abu Al-Qaiq complained about inflation and lowered them again.
I'm saying words, words that they say are parallel in the matter.
But now
And it is not a temporary solution.
And the problem increases in a greater way.
Therefore, here
Attempt from limit to limit of expansion
The shouting will always...
The increase has been phenomenal over the past year and the previous year as well.
The point. The point.
And they also work with the government, not just the ones who work with the private sector.
The private sector is completely neglected.
The current issue of the increase has shaken things up and should be viewed with equality as well.
I don't know where I got these notes or you.
We are living in Qatar, the MP is not living in Germany.
I'm telling you the opposite, today the private sector has started, it's starting to pay.
In most cases
Many Qataris who were working in the government sector have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries
Facing a problem
I am moving to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic.
And it gives good salaries.
We are connected to what is called the market force.
With the power of the market
They don't come, and they are from very high specializations.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar is the lowest, meaning lower salaries and lower costs.
And with the costs, they arrive.
With our complete understanding.
I don't anticipate events, and I'm not saying there's an increase in salaries.
There's no hope, you know.
For control of this expansion
Let's give them time.
Take control of this expansion
And God willing, this is what says that the report says Qatar in 2018.
Inshallah, I mean I'm saying
We see that these numbers will be reconciled.
They bribed a little bit of the people.
It means we are a professional operation.
Of course, with professionalism and with everything, but
From the swelling
Spending
Too big for the different projects
Please allow me to ask some questions from the viewers and I hope everyone asks their question directly, عبدالعزيز محمد from Morocco, please ask your question, Mr. عبدالعزيز.
This matter is based on the fact that ruling families in the Gulf…
Don't assume that the reasons for that are the disagreement of the OECD.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then, the ruler's wife and the rest are allocated for development.
In the absence of an accountant, things will proceed as they are.
Peace be upon you, and blessings of God.
Welcome, brother Ahmed.
I am my brother. I won't go on for long. Let me mention my brother regarding the systems of governance and the linking of the dollar to the rial, or the rial, or currencies of the Gulf to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world under its leadership.
The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $88 billion.
The European Union reached it with eighty-six billion dollars.
This means that all global policy directions are leaning towards the dollar.
As we pay the consequences of this crisis as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf states.
It may end in a confrontation between the United States
Between these two worlds, the advanced world such as China and Russia, and others, it may become an issue
A full regiment
The explosion of Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, as well as American bombs.
Thank you very much for this clarification and this information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Welcome, what’s your question?
Could you lower the volume of the television and ask your question?
I'm asking you a question.
The only thing I'm seeing is that the deputy is determined not to cooperate.
Subject: Lack of correlation with the dollar, as the dollar is declining.
And it will descend to the abyss, God willing.
It is good honey.
I don't follow the Arab Brotherhood's style
Thank you, Mohamed. Thank you. Thank you. My brother, Ahmed Hassan from Qatar has another entry. Your question, Ahmed.
May God bless you with goodness.
Thank you and thanks for the lovely interview.
Increase in salary, hopefully things will improve. We mean, that's what's important.
We are struggling with various problems in our colleges, not due to salaries.
The salaries, God willing, everything is fine.
Medicine Aoul quickly your question
I’m feeling like I’m feeling with you, there’s a question you have.
All fava beans, the price of fava beans, the whole merchandise is imported.
These are Europeans.
We have everything for the Arab world, factories and everything.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you for your time.
Now the issue is high prices, it's an important issue.
The issue of respect with rowdy troublemakers, stay with the good guys, the representative said.
The original from the person who has nothing but a billion here is pathetic.
Here, we are for some brothers, of course.
Those who don't know the diameter
This is incorrect for the state of Qatar.
The day I come to Qatar to see what the indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Top growth indicators in the world
Shake the hair to where Mazah will go, what will you do with it?
What is in the context of the response?
He, when he spoke, meant he asked the one from Morocco to speak in a way that wasn't truth and wasn't reality.
The person who does not see with their own two eyes.
If the person who says "uh huh" comes and sees Qatar, what major developments will happen there?
Growing significantly, you are asking yes.
And everyone has the right
And you guys are going to kill people like this? From where?
So, like, will you import a surplus of wood from China, wood?

It is considered one of the greatest achievements in Arab history.

The future will be oil and gas.
It means I don't go to Dubai anymore.

There were fatal mistakes.
Unfortunately, we were unable to use this device because we received some bad news.

Today has changed after thirty years.

Today is here, let's go here, capture it here.

And a vision
Thank you very much, Deputy. And thank you to our esteemed viewers.
Thank you for your continued support so that we could have presented you with
The foreign policy of Qatar appears vague to many observers.

It has begun.
Largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt
From Qatar, in anger, it rose to accusing her of conspiring against Egypt.
Also, the diameter was not far from important files.
Like Darfur in Sudan, and the Houthis in Yemen, even an Israeli soldier is a prisoner.
Qal’ashūlīt extended its hand to the political and external affairs of Qatar in a way that angered the larger Arab countries.
What strength are you putting into this place?
Of these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani
They write to us via our website www.aljazeera.net
Your Excellency, hello.
On September 21st of the year 2007 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It was a transformative visit in relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Re-planning the borders
Washing what is stuck
This is what I mentioned.
Al-Haqaz Newspaper/Magazine
The agreements you reached with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through which relations were established, and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
To start, your introduction was too long and needed many answers without your last question.
What I think he was carrying
Specifically regarding Saudi Arabia
What is the exact?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is important compared to Qatar.
Located between the two countries
I spoke about silencing the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have become clear from both sides.
And we accepted an explanation
In the State of Qatar
The dispute with Saudi Arabia
He has always been confined to a limited scope.
Perspectives
Praise be to God, and may Allah guide the commanders.
King Abdullah and His Highness Prince
In the Gulf, significantly
More than one hundred years
They were always bright and respectable relationships and relationships of trust.
I want to trap it in a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This topic is done and there were no conditions.
Solve any problem
But there was understanding and a sincere intention from both sides.
To solve this stuck issue
It's not seasonal, but a strategic relationship.
We wish her not to last, but to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic words
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar
I haven’t gotten used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have avoided many problems.
I have always said what I believed in
Saudi Arabia and therefore it is not diplomatic but faith.
The subject of Al Jazeera falls under the subject of media.
Between the two parties, and in many countries, it intervened.
In her opinion, it might be possible to earn points or to gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or, considering the diameter
Or, considering Saudi Arabia
I don't want the disagreement that's within the Gulf family.
It means, on the contrary to what it was before.
He prostrated himself in political agreement.
No, this wasn't an agreement, it was only a love agreement and a business agreement.
But whatever that is, this topic they are asking the Jazeera administration about: Did you build a strategy for it?
I'm between you and Saudi Arabia so that what happened before can be avoided.
The relationship was fundamentally based on a strategy of trust.
We can do it in two, three, four.
There should be unity.
I resolved some of the disagreements based on this.
Between some Arab countries and we resolve other disputes
Now, if we observe the disagreements in the Arab world, they are differences of opinion.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy in a particular action within a certain context, and other countries have a different opinion.
This represents two points of view.
It meant that some observers believed you were enjoying criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Direct criticism to her.
Have you exhausted me and decided to take it in a different direction, and then headed to a larger country, Egypt?
He means the same idea.
Lala ula, inna la natladhdu wa laysna faziyeen.
We deal with no other party in this manner.
It means the reasons for the disputes with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Between us and I know there is an understanding.
It's very big and you know our foundations are...
And there is a kind of model
But Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia
Let me put you under two lines.
I started arguing with them about Egypt regarding the Al-Ahram newspaper on April 11th last year.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
This is a comprehensive investigation that revealed the extensive investigations
Within Hezbollah’s network, a subversive plan was revealed.
Egypt aims to participate in a project that involves three countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
And Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known megaphone known for its complete rotation
Smallest countries in the Arab world
I pray for Egypt
We respect
And a struggle over the years
I'm not saying it to make your emotions sharp.
I’m finishing what I finished for you.
We can.
And the Egyptian President
Careful
On Arab Relations
First point
Gaza issue
As they say and as we admit
The diameter of the state
Its size is small.
You can participate in a plan like this
We've suffered from foreign interference at times, and I don't want to go back to that.
Who sold interventions of some countries in the Qatari affair
Therefore, the government’s policy of His Highness
Now that they discovered it, they're saying conspiracy
I want to tell the house, may God protect it, Syria and Iran defend themselves, I will not defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in this kind of issue?
And the pyramids do not speak from inclination.
Duwaile said that Qatar has been failing to achieve its goals regarding Egypt's dealings and its communications with Turkey and the European Union.
Their bandwidth is not sufficient to host a parallel conference for the Arab Summit, attracting less attention.
And you are using a demolished media channel, Al-Quds Channel.
Please, have a seat.
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable with this, you know.
I can tell you confidently
We are
It's not our place to intervene under such circumstances.
Whoever has supported our brothers in Egypt, and this is what we appreciate about the Egyptian officials.
The disagreements or sensitivities that exist among some government agencies in Egypt
But some officials have sensitivities.
What's up?
I'm coming to you about the issue.
Days of peace and a state of peace and we
And it was held before it in Egypt
And then we held
Israel
We're having a disagreement with her.
Do you have any disagreements with Israel?
And now, since the conference and from that day.
Any Islamic conference is an Arab conference there, they have sensitivity.
Why this sensitivity
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
And we always hope for the best.
This sensitivity we discovered.
O o three, meaning
Gaza conference that went
Egypt wants nothing but complications in Qatar.
It's not a car.
In Qatar and even though Kuwait is at its peak, they told us, guys
The Palestinian people marched and struck.
More than two weeks
But we scheduled it before the Kuwait Programming Conference, which we were the first to ban.
Arabs are killing and and
And web, it means procrastination.
The argument began.
And it was a small state that stood in this battle
Of course I know there are some brothers in the government and that also hurt Egypt, not for anyone but Egypt.
When they said after
Are you guys in the island?
The Israelis are saying that before a ceasefire, there will be a listening session to stop fighting before any speech or anything.
What is
Bro, take the medicine and food during the quarantine they're imposing on our brothers.
They say the door is heavy.
I don't enter the trucks.
They used to tell us that, and God willing, there was an agreement on the other side and they had to come.
Now isn't the time to get things open or to get enthusiasm.
I don't care about opening or excitement. What was important to us was 10.5 million and 600 who are calculating.
And they have medicine.
When we started talking about this topic and speaking at the Gaza conference
And Qatar's involvement in the matter causes sensitivity in the official in Egypt.
You don't go in.
We haven't spoken about how Egypt is handling the situation, as that is Egypt's responsibility.
One official said we discovered a huge conspiracy behind the issue.
He still hasn't told us what the plot is.
We mean, this is the responsible one.
They say Egypt is much bigger inside.
Well, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country and we always say it's a great country Egypt.
Therefore, we always ask the great state for many things.
Egypt is, relative to us
And you invited them to the conference as well, it was also an attempt to provoke them.
Let's go to the conference
Rebuilding Gaza
And we marched, and our position was united.
People are suffering in Gaza.
It means I know that Turkey has entered things through Israel.
I would be happy to see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
We and us
And if you are in Egypt, you will triumph, or if she does good political work.
This is what we believe is in the interest of Qatar and the Arab world.
Egypt’s stability is important to us.
If she does well, that is important to us.
Let me finish your question and your introduction for another quarter of an hour.
The story you told me, but now you've broken me.
I am that one, I am that one, I am now, meaning from anger.
Who angered the officials in the Egyptian system on you
We failed the Doha summit.
The second thing is that they didn't fail the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom, he wanted
Wireed works for his interests.
And therefore, an some countries do not ban it.
This is something I said to my brother in Saudi Arabia because we
We have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia regarding this point.
The limit is because it is apparent in an internal disagreement.
Who is in charge among these officials?
The officials have the biggest.
A large state with one responsible authority, and small states working on these activities.
It means there you were, you.
It is it it it she is doing any role
Darfur is a part of Egypt and Sudan.
The Five Great Powers and
If any other country besides Qatar could have
Indeed, these sensitivities lead to an increase in the matter. Why do you raise your noses at everything, everything seems dubious to you?
We need to get rid of the allergy, let's take an anti-allergy medication. They tell us what the allergy is like.
Why the sensitivity?
And some of the brothers in the government in the government.
They have an internal failure.
Iridon is a deceptive face, attention is not a sign of a conspiracy in Gaza, it means a coup.
It means, like they say the English, it's Italian.
Everything that is desired
Recipient for the for instructions for the analytics
I don't know what happened, because because
The issue must be addressed locally.
Don't treat
No way, my country is my priority.
My priority is to first consider the issues that concern my country.
And then consider if I have enough time.
Considering the perspectives of issues facing my Arab nation
And Al-Qatar tried to fix it.
And think about every Arab issue you can contribute to with our support as much as possible.
Why are you being provocative? Why don't you take it with good intentions?
I cannot treat you.
I can express my opinion.
What are you throwing at me?
We believe, we think, we are in our opinion.
What springs from his heart
Let me finish for you.
When the initiative for peace was announced and the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we were filled with hope, and I issued a statement welcoming this topic.
In drafts
Of course, the Egyptian official who highlighted his achievements.
In his article in a magazine, I think he had an interview on television or something, I'm not going to respond to it.
I have a response to every point.
But, in order to maintain the least amount of relations and Arab interests that connect us.
Response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
But all I advise is to change it.
And they try to fix their mistakes, whether internally or externally.
In politics or economics, or anything like that, we have mistakes in political and economic areas, and so on. No one is immune to error.
They are accusing Qatar of these accusations.
You deny Qatar's relations with anything related to Hezbollah.
This is a funny topic.
To damage Egypt’s relations, sabotage its role and communications with Turkey and the European Union
We, first of all, we are few in number.
If we are able to take on this role
This is incorrect.
There are accusations against you personally.
To pay those who despise Shalit until Qatar pays for Shalit and pays for her and increases the pressure on the Egyptian side in the matter.
He always accuses us of paying money first, we didn't pay money and we didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this corner
We stand with Egypt as we stood with it before, and we continue to stand with it as it resolves the Palestinian issue.
He insists that the Palestinian president will remain until this issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
And the authority remains with the Palestinian institutions until the dispute is resolved.
We said, here is.
At the Arab University, they say no, we've gone through it because we believe that some people don't want this topic.
But we went about it cleverly.
Does he mean he's talking to his boss?
Prime Minister
Yo, I don't know what's going on.
From our side, from theirs, I don't know.
On April 11th last year, Shorouk newspaper was the first to report the news.
The Egyptian political leadership has decided to launch an news channel to counter the media outlet known as Al Jazeera and to end
And all days end and matters are concluded and put in place.
But if you push them far enough, the island becomes something of the past.
Now, a teenage politician is living.
As you conceded to Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not yield, and they did not yield to us.
We dealt with them like brothers.
A small state yielded to the big country, Egypt.
Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, in an important point that I want to clarify
Qatari relations with Saudi Arabia differ
And then we'll talk.
Qatar establishes relations with Egypt
And we relied on them greatly.
Let me be straight with you, what do you mean by that?
This is against the main policy.
But we don't have any personal disagreement, I told you we respect the Egyptian people.
If you were asked now about the Gaza issue and what else?
And this is a sight, you know, it really affected us a lot.
I'm analyzing this from a psychological perspective, meaning I'm solving this issue.
Posted in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Prince Saud Al-Faisal will attend.
We talked about everything.
It was clear that things were tense and hadn't been resolved.
No no was was no see
I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt
They have a threshold, and it’s their right over us as brothers.
And we have a right, a due, owed to them as siblings, younger ones.
In the major countries, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other major country.
Egypt is larger than the Pyramids.
It's not a matter of life and death that I mean, but that the solution comes from heaven.
We are, for us, if anyone is waiting for it
Someone is waiting for a style.
Qatar has
Treat him with respect and brotherhood.
This is a great country, yes, we are proud of Egypt.
But if someone deceives someone
That means I know that Israel follows us.
Despite the previous American policies and also the previous administration, there was no or no agreement.
But I don't believe they want to imitate either Israel or America on this subject.
And then they mean, if I also take their policies, they are also pressured by external parties.
In several glasses of milk, let me finish for you.
Do we understand and know that messages still come, even to major countries?
The outfit is moving you in politics
We don't have any movement; our movement is one thing.
Internal Security Service of Qatar - Internal Affairs
What field can we help in the Arab world?
What are the sources of power for the terrestrial channel and the base of many?
You could say this isn't strong enough.
Belief in God and confidence in ourselves
His Highness's Vision
I don't want any excuses.
Let me finish for you, don't interrupt, we want to make a handshake with him
And I don't want to compete with anyone.
They say what they say, the largest bone or something like that.
But we have our own opinion.
The Israeli embassy first expelled us and closed our office.
Glory be to God, they used to say they had closed the office, we closed the office. They got upset and started saying to the Americans, "Look at these people."
They were queuing up with the guys they call "The Devil's Team."
What are they saying?
To the Americans and the Europeans, who are these our friends and we know how to deal with them.
The pliers
that she exerted
It means what's the point of reaching a stage where...
First now
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt one and two points?
And based on the fact that Egypt has a big role in the Arab world.
We think it's important to look into it.
I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this
But some of the staff
He needs to leave.
The occupation of the Egyptian public opinion, whether governmental or non-governmental, or its measurement with trivialities.
And focusing on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps
We are behind them, not in front of them, behind them because they are a major one.
In the foreseeable future
Wallahi, I mean I think, this topic, I can't imagine how the topic will happen.
And know that there will come a time for the mind.
And the time will come for those of us from our side
If I am
Oh, they have it.
They have great common interests, Arab.
I found one day that this topic
It means the world is still going far.
It means we shouldn't speak in the Egyptian style you have.
If someone extends their hand to us, we extend their arm by a meter.
Now, His Excellency Sheikh
We've never gotten used to running.
Based on a solid foundation, we are ready to run for Egypt
Let's go with Egypt
There are currently many rumors about Egyptians working in Qatar being harmed due to this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs, whether in mosques or in major jobs.
Do you know that in this topic, it's not a characteristic of Qatar to dismiss jobs and cancel them out
These people have nothing to do with what's going on.
This is a market with a shift in demand in one that they are canceling in one that comes.
He was a refugee and a seeker, and in other nationalities he concealed themselves in nationalities that increased.
A quick answer.
The office was there.
We are worried that the office assumes it is currently
We were worried about the days when they were launching attacks so that all our losses in negotiations with Israel were due to this office.
This we closed, let them discuss the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them we were, as our custom is to invite all the accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to honor Gabriella Schell.
No way. He hasn't honored her like this before when things were better, like he claims. It's a little difficult to honor her now.
There is no reason now to reopen the office in this period.
The office opens if the reasons cease to exist.
You raised me.
The size of Egypt means
Egypt is the one who imposed the haze.
Our relationship with America is a strategic one. I want to be consistent with you.
In some matters and this
What are the most important things?
In matters regarding treatment of certain pathologies in our region, we differed with the previous administration.
Now, we honestly have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe that this administration
Road to peace, moving the path of peace. Road to solving the Palestinian issue.
All our friends and this is what we don't deny.
What is happening in Iran, what is its impact on the Gulf and on you?
This is a topic that Iranians decide how to solve their problems.
among them
In their usual ways, and I’m sure their concerns will exceed this crisis.
Iran's stability is like what we have mentioned, Your Highness.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share a common border with Iran.
Of course, we have special relationships with all our neighbors, including Iran.
We are only chanting for peace and stability for this region.
And we intervened in everything that was at the edge who wanted to change or replace the Doha agreement.
I think Saad Hariri said
Now, the discussion has ended, and the strategic speech between the president
And the Lebanese groups
How to see
As for Yemen, either you have a role, or the Yemenis have taken a stance from you.
First of all, we are known for supporting unity when almost the whole Arab world opposed the Yemeni unity.
These are the only Arab, standing alone, and Gulf with the Yemeni unit.
And regarding the South, we have spoken with Yemen, and I was twice sent by His Highness the Prince to meet with the Yemeni President.
He tasked him with the goal of stability in Yemen, as Yemen is an important country in the Arab Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I don't want to say anything more, both parties did what?
But the truth is, I'm actually sad.
If the person who stood in this situation is accused of paying the Houthis and senior officials
The Yemenis, because we don't interfere in these matters.
Whoever stands with the Unit does not stand by its side.
And another goal for the benefit of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
This is a topic we're not against, but honestly, I'm shocked.
I went more than ten times during the fighting. His Highness, the Prince, sent me in Yemen among Yemenis.
I’m sorry for this accusation is strange.
Time is up, but briefly, is the problems you encountered in your efforts to solve them going to change your policies? Regarding intervention in other Arab problems
"Wallahi, if His Highness heard my words, then indeed I see that there is no need."
And they presented to us a large sum.
More than five billion dollars at that time, meaning if we invested it, it would become fifty billion, which is better than a headache.
But I'm saying it because I believe it, because maybe the time in the Arab world now means
What allows this in this situation?
Thank you, congratulations, Sheikh Al-Majdi.
And perhaps even the exceptional with its Sheikh Hamad’s state
What happened in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Regarding delegating the committee and providing it with all the support.
On the subject of Lebanon after the Israeli aggression in Lebanon
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, we were able to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we felt this in Doha, both sides were keen.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or for him to be there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew
Okay, here's the translation: "After spending hours talking with the Lebanese, we realized what the problem is."
And I believe it is a shared success
But there was a determination there.
I believe the Lebanese situation and the atmosphere in the region directly reflect on him.
Whether peaceful or not
Lebanon has earned its place with this location.
If it is like that
And unfortunately
External reflections
I can say the problem between Lebanese people, even if it's not problem number one.
The state of Sheikh, I know that perhaps the time isn't too early to talk about the behind-the-scenes.
What happened? Why did you come here?
I stopped if the expression "colliding on the ground" is correct.
You haven't been late a single moment, right?
What exactly was happening, I know it very well. Even the symbols that the Lebanese were using at that time were telling me what happened.
I was from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
Tell him if we're coming to Leanin
I'm proposing this idea, Your Highness the Prince's support and endorsement.
It includes all Lebanese leadership.
Because you're here in Beirut, you're looking at everyone in their area.
And you guys are in the same hotel and in the same place.
And in the same airplane, you met and talked.
We created this atmosphere but from the beginning we thought
And this was the most important decision of all.
Of course, in that case
This is what I felt from the Arab University.
We will be honest intermediaries.
And الحمدلله, he believed that this has proven to everyone that Qatar has exerted an effort.
On both sides
To access a supervisor solution for both parties
And if there is a solution, there isn't a loser.
Before you take your step
The consultation took place at the Arab University and we found support.
What have we done?
And we speak his language while we are there.
If we succeed in Lebanon in transferring them to Doha
And he commanded me to
Sugar on them and take the phones away from them.
We were able to help them there and also for the brothers in Syria were supportive of the situation.
And I told you at the beginning that without Arab support, the committee couldn't have done anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that has occurred.
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan.
In a certain situation surrounding the Arab world
And everything that burned us with fire
It is an interest of the Arab world in external interventions and
And we try as much as possible to have
Sends forces
Even militarily
In this case, I think the topic is
In Sheikhdom Point
He always used to say the solution to the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file.
Actually Saudi Syria
B qāfif qāfif, idhā ṣaḥḥa aw qāfif ʿarab yaʿnī qatār wal-jamāʿah al-ʿarabiyyah
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to genuine self-correction between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to reflect on ourselves.
The Arab disputes
Any agreement between two Arab countries
And this is what we tried.
In the War of 73
When Arabs agree to solve an issue
I thought this is an interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
Both sides
Let wisdom prevail.
Arab relations on the right track
We in the Arab world face huge and great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
And we have no power nor strength.
And how do we stop the games in the arena of the Arab countries?
Agree at least to the minimum agreement
Unfortunately, we are complaining.
We are watching.
We disagree Arabically and there is a lack of trust between us Arabically. Trust is missing between Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries
It's not defection as much as it is a kind of
What is a Jalassi called?
This issue needs to be stopped by everyone, I think.
Is this a wish? Will you embody it? Will you really request a summit of Arabs?
I suffer when you suffer, and I rejoice when you rejoice.
I mean, it came with the words.
Could you play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if informally?
We are keen on finding solutions and I am sure that with their wisdom.
They may reach to to to to an agreement
In their many eyes
And I was in harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this is
The relationships are improving.
Both sides need to want to take a step forward.
But I cannot assert with certainty that this is what is happening now.
I am sure that if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and problems in some Arab countries that I mentioned,
A state of optimism and a state of pride in the citizen is a general Arab health.
But I can't connect what happened in Lebanon.
It can be translated to Earth, meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There may be an escalation, perhaps American-Iranian, perhaps others mean.
Are you still afraid of her during the coming months?
We are Arabs
We can only order food and medicine to be delivered.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready, Your Highness the Emir always.
More than one hundred and two million and a half Palestinians are imprisoned.
We do not want weapons for them, and we do not want their victory, and we do not want
They are doing all of this
And electricity
And we hope that the Red Cross will go and deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we reach them with food and medicine only.
And our disagreement continues with them.
I wish for the Palestinians on both sides to prioritize the national interest.
And they leave the illusions behind.
Now, this Palestinian rift is a deep wound.
To the solution
And they did not comply, and they did not adhere.
This is a dangerous topic and they must adhere to the Mecca agreement.
And they should request it, even if they go back once more to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And they resolve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
Wow, promises from every side.
I hope it’s resolved, but
Our position is well-known on this topic, and the amount for each party involved is that...
We will not be a party and we will not accept being a party to any military conflict with Iran.
We have a good relationship with her.
But we are those of sovereignty, and they are those of sovereignty.
Everyone sees their own interests, but those interests will not sustain them or sustain us.
We believe that the Gulf's destiny is to have a clear agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And Iran is for cooperation and for coexistence in peace.
But when a Gulf state says Qatar is not a party
Could you please provide more details or clarification?
Just a reference
No way
Okay, sure. Here's the translation: Okay, I would like to return if you allow the Lebanese file.
With all honesty, these countries, meaning we were facing a big deadlock, and then in the last few hours, we reached a solution.
Some have linked what happened to what was announced.
Perhaps it's information that might be scattered and unrelated to some things, but what happened?
You've even reached this result
What happened in Istanbul, I know he had specific dates beforehand.
You were knowing in negotiations
Constantly in the subject of the solution
And there is no doubt that the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changing the tactics of discussions
Regarding discussions led
As a result of bringing together various parties from different sides
Let's start talking.
In this Arabic and Qatari note with this paper
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we start talking about the substance one after another.
And in the last moment to overcome an obstacle, it ended up at the very end.
But the prince passed by the edges.
And remove this obstacle
And he was in solution.
We heard the word “Emir of Qatar” at the opening session in Doha.
It means you consider your role now
Okay, here's the translation: "The most important thing is to keep this topic out of the spotlight."
We don't have regional ambitions.
I swear, we'll have control over a country or something like that because we are a country.
We take pride in ourselves, we believe we can contribute to solving matters with our other brothers.
But the Arab world is very important.
It's in this country
We want her to do something, and that's very important.
Some countries, being small, are able to play this role and support it.
There are some things that are excellent, some that are good, and some that are less than good.
The last question to the Sheikh
What is the main priority?
Is it a political priority?
Ameni aslah that al-bayn
What is the meaning of confronting Israel?
We stopped playing in the Arab region.
We fix our problems in the Arab countries.
This is an active member in Iraq.
To guide his colors
Locally and internationally
But if we put our heads in bees' holes
It means that any victory before us or we don't have any hope.
Thank you, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this valuable interview.
And the efforts made to put an end to the war taking place in Gaza.
And we begin by requesting a hearing session for the Arab University Council at the level of
And you, as well as having disregarded
Regarding a request for an urgent Arab Summit meeting
In the beginning, I am happy to be with my colleague, Hassan, to be in this program.
Although the circumstances
The humanity that our brothers in Gaza are exposed to
Conditions call for us to do a lot.
Qatar did not divert attention from the Arab Summit
Honestly, when we went with the idea of the Arab Summit...
Unified is not a UN Security Council resolution but also through
Don't always step on them and underestimate them.
And let me put it in other sentences.
And we are teaching manners.
The street could no longer bear it if the officials bore it.
It cannot withstand.
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven signed approvals.
Some of them spoke in the meeting and it was possible to hold the meeting.
We complicate things as much as there is Arab agreement.
And I don't blame those who think there shouldn't be an opportunity for their observation.
Oo oo and how to solve the problem
She is a snake.
This is the important matter.
Our goal is not advertising or promotion; our goal is to find
You weren't looking away from the summit.
And among ourselves, we ask.
We're going to go to press the other poor side.
The previous and the next, and the Security Council decision, but let's just focus on the Arab Summit. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
Speak clearly that the situation may require holding an Arab Summit with whomever attends.
And we found that most of the brothers support holding the summit.
Who blocked me
I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation is, you mean, if we go anywhere in Asia, in Latin America, etc.
Without solution
which are classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our view?
Are we abandoning the Palestinian plight?
Because what we don't like
Are we intervening in the Palestinian affair in a way
It means there's no mother who would allow someone to enter who is good or who is bad.
He is saying that Hamas, Hezbollah's faction, doesn't know if another party will emerge.
Is she a student?
And how can we, can we be part of the Arab body?
It meant we were supposed to be infiltrated into an Arab internal conflict.
Well, if we go to the Security Council
There was no resolution in the Security Council
I hope after I finish my mission for Israel
The esteemed second Arabic ministerial session which you invited to
That was dominated by debates and disagreements and sharp clashes
He is on an important point.
Isn't this not the important thing?
If we listened
From the crossings
There is no more cup of peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
But someone says that we have to wait.
We are in an Arab initiative
Wanjmed mabahatat al-salam ma'a Israel
We're saying that we're saying we're losing on this topic.
We’ve lost more than we’re losing now, but we’ve always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the ceasefire.
Sa'ada al-Sheikh says that the Al-Al Mashadaat are not important.
There was someone who wished to return to the enthusiasm and so on.
This is a statement of a political stance rather than a dispute between ministers and so on.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that occurred.
But not everyone
I don’t want to talk about other people.
It’s very important that we be men of ourselves, men of our country.
We are taking action regarding these issues.
Who is representing her with such things?
Think means
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone performing roles B and B on behalf of the West?
Hopefully, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
Following the Security Council resolution
What will be his work schedule?
The situation seemed in the decision in the Arab effort
And here is the disagreement if Israel were to implement the resolution immediately.
We can say in a decision
But Israel did not implement this decision.
Now are we ready to go and order chapter seven in... I know that of course there are difficulties.
Don't ask the international community, and if you are questioned
Hesitantly
The status
They believe that they have rightfully condemned the Jews or the Israelis.
They are taking what is theirs.
This Arabic position current
If the Arabs did not go to the Security Council
And they agree on a summit and make difficult decisions.
And the Western countries will seek for us.
But we are deep within Arab identity, within the world, and within humanity, and you see how the Arab street is moving on this issue.
But this decision is important.
With numerous calls to our presidents, one after another
Okay, so basically, they said and at the end they confirmed that there was no Van Wolfson.
But if now we were like Germany or something, would we demand?
They don't need to pay compensation for the attack they carried out, you're providing false information.
And it kills hundreds of thousands.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We, as Arabs, fought each other.
He attends in how
Removal of the employee
It was empty and I was able to.
If the Arab nation says that if you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur.
The Arabs considered or there was someone who considered the decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six.
The guys witnessed the issuance of the decision.
The Security Council passed
I don't want to say that it's a victory or not a victory.
The matters leading to their conclusion
Let's assume victory
What are we doing?
We assume the rest of the decision will be made in it, if we don't comply.
But I assure you, we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will comply with it, but it should not be complied with the decision.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted.
That means we
Will you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones who call for a ministerial hearing?
I don't believe that the Arab nation
The current situation is ready for an alternative.
And I don't believe the Arab nation is ready.
In the siege of Gaza
For other political goals
To dominate one group over another in Palestine, instead of fixing their issues between themselves.
Let's try to plan.
They once held a gathering I don't know about European intelligence like that without mentioning names.
And once, they did mean, we are sharing.
In execution
What do we need from the West
But if we go
This is what I want there to be sorting.
I'm obviously not talking about the decision, I'm talking about
Consequences of this topic started two years ago, Gaza topic, not now.
I would have talked about the topic two years ago, but specifically about the decision.
Do you have any objections to its clauses?
Leader and exhausted.
Let us go
They might believe we have a different point of view.
Everyone was expected to have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for us all to have the same opinion, but I think those who went ahead put in a lot of effort.
And we thank them for it.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza since two years ago, I stated that parties
Encouraging one group over another participated in the subject of the siege of Gaza
I have already agreed to the statements, hints, or accusations that have come from here and there.
On a genuine Arab complicity in everything happening now in Gaza
We are reviewing the details.
Let me tell you and we haven't looked at everything.
But I know
The Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
If ignited Arabically and internationally
And they did not argue if they did not ignite this difference.
And after the elections that took place
There is enthusiasm for authority.
Baghalbiyeh
It is assumed that if we give them a chance and see...
Iridon is correcting them and they are still revolutionary, meaning revolution. They only know the basics and fighting.
But on that day inside
Arabs sold their brothers believing that these radical movements should not come to power.
Now they're saying about each other that there was an attack
Hammas violated the ceasefire or, rather, the Palestinians from Gaza broke the ceasefire.
Ceasefire
The people of Palestine in Gaza remain together for two years.
It's okay.
For Israeli security reasons
I don't want them in this trial, it doesn't concern me. I'm in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
And then who decides?
These or none of them have sovereignty in choosing
The governments
That's the root of the problem.
But I'm sure it could have been treated.
If we witnessed it, if we witnessed it, that the disagreement
But it is clear that we were required to overcome group against group, because these groups
We consider them terrorists or whatever we consider them.
All of this has led to...
And also, the promises that the side that will live up to them are suitable.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts made to put an end to what is happening, just as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
On those Egyptian efforts
He never was evasive.
She was assigned an important role.
And also, Egypt shares borders with the borders of Israel and the borders of Palestine.
We are
And now we need to stop this.
In Gaza, and Jenin, people are stopping the work in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace.
There must be
And therefore, we always ask her for a bigger role.
It was announced.
It cannot be evaluated now.
Or to give the possibility of success or study
I believe in chances of success.
If the brothers in Egypt can
I appreciate Palestinian perspectives.
And whoever is discussing the initiative assumes the harmed party in Gaza.
He can say yes and he can say no.
And this is an important point.
When the decision was issued in the year 1966
We have a problem with a Palestinian car.
We don't want to hear a word.
But I wish I had gone with the Palestinian delegation.
And when they went to the university, they asked for someone to be with them from Gaza.
Even the Israelis have now realized that this is our brother, we are with them.
This is an important point.
We do not make power.
It is our goal to protect and defend and and we build our policy
Stay in power.
The Sheikh
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative, considering you haven't reviewed its terms, but
From a fundamental standpoint, do you believe it is suitable to be sent to implement the international decision of War and Peace sixty as some have stated?
Balanced role
Now I won't tomorrow or after tomorrow because
Every day
In the blood of our brothers, there is spilling.
What we want is to inform the Israelis about this topic when they finish their investigation, then we start to propose this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt are aware of this and are looking after it.
And this is what I want, I'm saying everything I have to say.
Now I need to solve the issue.
And it's not like you want Israel
Turkey has played a role since the beginning of the crisis.
So, is it an expression?
About an Arabic void
And there was no doubt that the situation was striking.
And it has Arab depth.
Her entry is in Arabic deficiency in Arabic deficiency.
We know that in an Arab deficit
Part of it due to the disputes
Part of it is due to the perspectives of each individual. I believe my perspective is the best.
Someone believes that their point of view is the best.
And in Consensus how we can make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision
And none of them were alone among us.
One person says no, it doesn't matter, give them two or three days more so I can train them and get the team up to speed and solve the issue.
We must refrain from this and not accept this.
They might make mistakes, we have to hold them accountable for Hamas.
Arabic Arabic
But now
At least I tell them no.
Within the framework of the situation also required of Qatar, as we hear, we will return to this point but
Midanīyā أيضًا في نفس الوقت أنت سمعت
Khaled Mashal yesterday was the Secretary-General of Hamas movement.
First of all, it's not necessary to repeat everything the brother Khaled Mashal said, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit with Khaled Mostafa and talk to him as Arabs?
Get it for the Arab League and tell them.
This is important.
With enthusiasm
Israel imposed conditions as well, it imposed conditions
Let them also impose conditions, meaning it's forbidden for them to impose conditions, and on Israel, conditions are imposed.
First, what do you think of this Arab popular song?
I don't care or these are just crowds that we don't need to listen to them at all. They tell me, "They say I didn't hear the words."
It’s completely different, Diqool says first of all, liberate his country.
Allies and non-allies freed their country from Nazi occupation.
Now it’s us who are talking about.
إن الهبة العربية احنا يفترض.
The supposed leaders represent the opinions of their people.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations that we witnessed
It can be fulfilled from these, from these rows of requests.
Also, many who criticize Qatar in this situation demand
Regarding what is happening and the office and the representative are still open.
They're using the same logic.
We cut ties, we go with all Arab countries.
To cut off all relationships, even if someone says he has a contract.
Iridon, a clear disc, only.
We are
And this is more important than the relationship.
It's not just in this decision, in this and in tougher decisions.
Who is this decision from?
It is undoubtedly necessary for us to have an Arab unified stance.
To others
I don't sell anything to anyone based on the idea that I'll gain any moral or material benefits from it, or that I claim to.
Yes, meaning before we close this file in this topic as well, there are countries that have taken individual steps
Good, Chávez’s situation is different. Chávez had a conflict with the United States.
What do our people need, what do we need to call for?
Five permanent ambassadors presented the arguments, this is a movie.
We’re done with that street, I’m wiser than that now.
On the highest ceiling, happiness of Sheikh.
He is calling for resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter is framed within a single Arab context, it can succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that respects us through people.
I don't believe the Arab countries are ready to fight.
We are being stimulated.
How will we deal with Syria and how will we deal with Lebanon and other countries, and there are Arab countries that don't speak to each other.
What needs to be
A qualitative shift in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab countries.
Listing but I think your eligibility has ended.
in the goals
The important story
We know how Lebanese makeup is done.
Lebanon There is no doubt that
She gave an example that if I return to look at them.
The situation in Gaza is different. The situation in Gaza remains.
Surrounded on all sides
And this siege
It gives a nature that varies
Yes, I mean the goals regarding Israel, specifically the goals of the operation regarding Israel.
A day for affliction, a day for punishment, a day for such and such a day, a day of mercy for such and such a person.
And so, the example that happened in Lebanon is not a good example for them.
Solution model obtained in Lebanon
He considers it valid.
Gaza
See the problem in Gaza or or Palestinians their solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon
We are different in some ways, whether we return it today or return it tomorrow.
My disputes with the authority.
On the distribution of power
This is different because the fabric of theirs is closer to each other.
From the fabric of thought in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is easier.
And here is the problem.
Happiness Sheikh
It means we only have a few minutes left to finish this topic and determine where...
And a diplomat means
How can this process be ended?
For the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
He refuses or he rejects.
And we help
Those who didn't come with us.
It failed, so it's up to us Arabs.
As a strategy
But on the Palestinian side
There have been some efforts, but we haven't seen a comprehensive initiative.
Not before, nor now, why?
It's not a simple thing, it doesn't initiate as we feel it.
Whoever solves the issue, we help without mentioning the country's name, as some people might be sensitive to mentioning the country's name.
Our goal is not to reach the peak because we already have the peak scheduled for March.
If we take the initiative, we will be better than our brothers, I don't think.
We should not press on them.
History won’t forgive us if we pressured them.
We are moving forward with this initiative, having seen participation from all sides – it was scheduled for four days but was postponed due to going to the Senate.
We hope that, God willing, we will make progress. We ask our Arab brothers to help us as much as possible on this topic.
We hope to keep it away from the subject of competition
The Arabic Arabic
Because of my conflict with the Sudanese government at times
And this is also our problems, you know? Okay, we fight among ourselves, we disagree.
I don't want to participate in this topic.
In Kuwait on the nineteenth of this month, as far as I think, the Arab situation is as it is
As you know, as I mentioned, and as I have detailed, your capacities.
Does the entire Arab climate help it be the first economic peak?
His Highness
And we, of course, are always at the top with any Arab brother. We are always there.
And we always have no objection to attending any summit.
But doesn't he fear that it will turn into a political peak?
Of course, assuming that time imposes itself.
The time has passed, and even if it means after ten days.
We are talking about Palestinians after they were taken for twenty-five days eating grass.
It means...
It is said that the Arabs were unable to listen.
That’s what we said.
That’s what we said.
With all due respect, this summit is scheduled and we are committed to it.
I think we are
The Arab Street is upon us.
BB, the way we're going about it
And therefore, I mean.
And we submit.
And he says, "It's finished."
Regarding this meeting
Thank you viewers for watching.
And goodbye. Coverage continues for the ongoing war on Gaza. And goodbye.
Before days, the celebration of the World Disability Day was.
Hissa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and the Ministry prepared a draft law on...
I have held membership in numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have presented more than seventy lectures and workshops, and a published article in Arab and international magazines.
To begin, let's agree on the term currently being used.
Referring to people with disabilities: Are they people with special needs or, as I said, people with disabilities?
Good evening.
People with disabilities have been taken away from the rights-based approach or from human rights culture.
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
And then his disability resulted from his attempts to adapt to society.
Then, the natural concept prevailed.
Then, the concept of the ال ال ال shifted to a concept of.
Special education and private education appeared
This group has become
And we started calling them people with special needs.
These are the standard rules from which it was derived.
Course description concerning the monitoring of the implementation of this document
Then the pace quickened until the international agreement that was legally binding appeared, and it was distinguished from the rules in this regard.
And she set a basic condition or fundamental rule, this term.
Who treats these people as humans, as people, as individuals.
With changes to the terminology as you suggested, is there a change in the perception of this community group?
Yes and it is measured by
Different from one region to another
But the special thing about this topic
Is the Arab world similar or different?
However, a human rights culture exists within them, for example in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons may be due to a lack of financial resources, it is not.
Of course, here's the translation: “Naturally, this is what I wanted to say – culture exists, but there’s sometimes a lack of resources, and occasionally a shortage of political will.”
Sometimes legislation but
Unfortunately, consciousness is limited to a few things and also human rights culture is lacking.
Ten percent of the world’s population have disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment.
Through my visit to Darfur, I realized...
He and despite the mines and the weapons
For males, a slightly better grade.
People with disabilities are located in remote areas in distant regions.
Therefore, there are many trends of platforms that operate in this field and try to raise
Awareness can achieve justice in education.
Instead of creating many religious centers, if I understand correctly.
It is heading towards creating rehabilitation centers and hospitals and schools.
And this is one of the things that, thanks to God, we were able to achieve through our work in the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the state of Qatar.
Scheduled agenda
And embedding work schedules for these humanitarian organizations so that those centers are included.
In light of the deteriorating situation of people with disabilities worldwide
I can't call it or agree with you that there's a retraction.
If there is a decline in the Arab region regarding the issue of disability
Within the societal context, within the political context, within the economic context, we cannot expect the circumstances of people with disabilities to be…
And we are from marginalized groups
But in a country like Gaza, like Darfur, like what happened to you
Actually, I cannot make it absolutely certain that there will be no improvement in the situation.
And yes, I have translated it on the ground, for example, if it is possible to show an example.
Like the Qatari Red Crescent Moon
We agreed that the projects will enter
For people with disabilities, within that strategy, and there are other projects
We also tried to enter her.
Includes work of organizations based on the ground

Good evening, سليمان قرو

Best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa, esteemed.
Firstly, are there any cognitive disabilities included in the UN conventions?
Cognitive impairment means a healthy person was a result of pressure that occurred, that pressure did not experience cognitive impairment.
Suffered from a disability as a result of torture and imprisonment. He has suffered a mental disability so far and has been undergoing treatment for six years.
I know, I know, there are about four hundred people between a child and an adult, some of them are mentally disabled. As for the prisons...
Is there a law in the United Nations?
The truth is, I am.
Understanding means knowing, being aware, aware of what they know as they know their children.
Every word has a meaning, meaning is intention, intention without without without without making themselves named.
And there are values in the West
Agreed upon, but people...
Those who understand that some people are apostates or have been misled from Islam – their judgment should not be taken into account.
Thank you very much, Nayef Al-Saidi, for telling us from Kuwait.
Return to our side to comment on what came in.
Communications, Suleiman wondered if there was a cognitive impairment.
Yes, included in the classification
Al-ʿĀlamī lil-ʿʿāʾah ʾakīd al-ʾʿāfah al-fikriyyah wa al-dhinnīyah kamā taṣmā.
There are impairments within these disabilities, including sensory impairments, meaning visual or auditory impairments, and motor impairments.
Of course, as I mentioned, the disability is
Action and reaction occurs within the context of a specific framework.
In the Arab world or in any regions
It is certain that confronting disability takes a long stage
And even at the level of the United Nations
There was I, for example, during my experience and work as a private executor, among the things I was trying to address and work on.
The meaning of truth for all.
until they prepare
Different therapies to ensure their entry into schools as well as organized work
She works on professional qualification that includes people with disabilities.
I entered it with some improvements.
Especially after the repair
It is generally found in this international organization
I also mean, as a special decision-maker.
This is practical and this was positive for me, if not directly related.
and which supported this position
His flag was present in many meetings, for example, international agreements
For the rights of people with disabilities
It means her progress is hindered by these restrictions or shortcomings.
Regarding legal nationality
This is just one of the fundamental points in the world of disability that is not
The United Nations unfortunately experienced some technical issues during the drafting process.
Regarding organizations and agencies
مثلا وسانهي بهذا
The world includes governments and non-governmental organizations, major countries, and the United Nations.
We sent out a recent survey.
To the United Nations and its agencies in the different regions
He wants us to know to what extent disability programs are on their agendas.
If you are balancing, if there is a share for people with disabilities
Human rights
It's not just a development shells.
Okay, let’s translate this text into English: “Okay, we are receiving more communications from you now, Tariq Najji from Algeria, please, Najji.”
And peace be upon you.
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria, and I don't know exactly.
I wanted to ask if I am originally Muslim, I am a physically disabled person.
Okay, we will proceed with the translation. We will direct this question to Najy Meshri. She told us she is from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Aleppo from Greece, please Ahmed.
Good evening, Madam. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, clothing, and seasonal items, so that I take them on seasonal trips, and this is happening in Europe.
And is the psychiatric patient considered disabled?
Especially, they may cause harm to others or to themselves.
And all we’re talking about is unproductive discussion, and thank you.
The teacher, Hissa Al-Taweer, mentioned financial difficulties.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, and I demand it.
Establish an international disability support fund and allocate one hundred percent of its net profits from each institution worldwide.
And that must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
Many disabled people and war victims and so on will be paralyzed with helplessness and despair.
Thank you so much, Abe Ibrahim Abdullah, for talking to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri wondered and presented his problem, he is disabled.
At the local level or at the national level, through Algeria.
The needs within the local community must be met within that community.
It is the same rights that should come to anyone else.
Truth in life first, then truth in housing, truth in health, and truth in education.
Therefore, I truly call from here, from this governmental platform, the Arab governments in particular.
For this citizen and this individual
For integration
Those needs and rights are already included in the agendas.
There's no need to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of people with disabilities or if this country
It can, and indeed must be, committed to fulfilling it.
I would first advise him to return and go to the responsible authorities at the governmental level, if possible.
That falls within the national scope and must be done within this scope.
Mentioning the International Agreement for Persons with Disabilities there are many signatory countries but they do not comply.
And here we raise a question from one of the callers who asked why there aren't any laws there.
It's a truth, for sure. We are in a human society, meaning there are many mistakes and many truths.
Certainly, many agreements and certainly many documents do not have a literal commitment in them.
Or a perfect commitment, many countries have joined like CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know that.
But the problem is that we adopt an agreement and organize ourselves around it.
First, we will ensure that there is at least awareness.
This awareness begins from the top of this pyramid, those who are decision-makers.
And the officials then gradually progress until they reach the entire community.
Also, our commitment to providing reports, and these reports reach the United Nations.
The problem of knowledge and understanding and increasing levels of awareness and and
For reports, did you work as an authority in the United Nations?
Yes, regarding what I saw and what I recorded there, there is interest.
Therefore, I believe there is a relative advantage for the WOU for the agreement on the rights of persons with disabilities.
Therefore, I advise and encourage and invite.
It also means it's important that people with disabilities
And we will hear what Abdullah Al-Snari, the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf, says.

For Disability International Support Fund
Disability and it is binding for all countries to provide funds, what do you think of this proposal
The United Nations has a fund called the Trust Fund for Victims
And unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
It is important to monitor the application of standard rules.
When I worked those six years, there was hardly any support.
From China and Austria
And I always mean, I am grateful to this country for this support.
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
I established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects. Thank God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
It's like we discussed at the beginning, and this point is always raised that
With the concerns of ordinary people
It is often asked how we should care for people with disabilities or care about the disabled.
It means that if there was a real, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all its forms, in all categories
People with disabilities, orphaned children, adolescents, refugees
All of you will truly be, we may reach a level that is called
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equality

My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
And for the genetic level, there may be a result meaning a shortening caused by families, which is marrying relatives.
I believe this is a large percentage.
It leads to impairment.
Thank you very much, Brigadier Shrief, for speaking to us from Tunisia and I will get back to you, our guest.
First, Hamad Al Mari wondered about
He is heading towards a young woman with a disability, who is disabling herself.
He wonders where it's heading.
In every country
There are definitely services offered for all types of disabilities, and in the state of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether intellectual disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
Regarding these schools
In the past, there was
Now, I mean private education, specifically in the Ministry of Education and Higher Education that has now become the Supreme Council.
The officer Shrief from Tunisia pointed out an important point.
And scientific papers and other things
I am programs for organizations that work with disabilities only, but even within campaigns that
Private programs for women
All of this has directed a lot of campaigns and reproductive health programs until
I spoke about this aspect.

It raises awareness
For the risk of marrying relatives
And genetic factors
And I believe in the state of Qatar.
And with habits and traditions, but it takes time for sure.

But with time, there is a response to it, but it is necessary for it to be legally binding, meaning
Yes, Crowan Behjett wondered and suggested that one hundred percent of the Arab Fund’s budget be allocated
To help people with disabilities, let me start with
Yes, there is statistical estimation that was applied by the World Health Organization to the whole world.
There are approximately 40 million people with disabilities.
Half of them are women.
But these settings are doubling.
Like there is a study in South Africa that found and proved
It is confirmed that the statistics that appeared about the war in Iraq about the war in Gaza.
Every killer deserves three disabled people.
And since our Arab region has become, without a doubt, a region of conflict.
Even the proposal presented by Behjat Krawan
One hundred percent won't be enough.
To help people with disabilities in the Arab region if
The issue of kinship is concerning for people with disabilities and other marginalized groups.
Honestly, and truly, I don't see it agreeing.

She affirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
What governments do doesn't generally count people with disabilities.
This is also related to the culture of the community and sometimes restrictions.
The community, meaning when a population census is conducted by
The devices in question
About the presence of a disabled person in the house.
There was just a question asking if there was a disabled person or not.
The relevant section concerning this topic and through the involved parties there is
Let's collaborate on preparing the form.
We instructed for more details.
First, it is clarified if this disabled person is male or female.
And is assistance provided or not?
The reality is, even the number is correct as I know it, but why didn't we reach the exact result?
Let the attention be such in the advancement of Fatima Al-Dosari with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with disabilities.
And I extend my thanks to the Wali (Governor) of the country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, the wife of Mrs. Moza, regarding her embrace of this category.
I truly am proud, truly proud of the care and attention I received.
On her important role

Thank you very much, lovely Al-Misferi from Qatar, a breeze with you.
Abdulkareem from Jordan, please enjoy the breeze.
Please, go ahead and speak, we’re listening.
And peace be upon you.
Thank you very much, I honestly have an input.
First thing, I'm an audiologist and I worked in Qatar for about four years.
And we had a month of awareness about hearing and speech problems
We were holding conferences and lectures and awareness campaigns for the hearing impaired.
Now I need to talk about Jordan. I have been living in Jordan for about three years.
Honestly, it offers new and wonderful services.
Honestly, I offer new services, whether financial, non-financial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, in the sources
Those affiliated with the Ministry of Education in public schools
As well, we as private institutions
We are receiving wonderful and beautiful support.
Okay, Karim, do you have a direct question only, due to time constraints, I apologize for taking up your time.
Do you have a direct question?
In the state of Qatar, in the state of the United Arab Emirates, Jordan offers wonderful services and I believe they are very excellent.

Also, it's on them to play a role, not just the issue is a matter of rights, they are recipients of rights.
Sheikha Hassa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former Special Advisor to the United Nations on Disability, thanks you.
We welcome the elegant presenter of Al-Douri and Al-Kass channel, Lana Lana, good morning.
It gives me great pleasure to welcome the outstanding captain in the ranks of Al Asalah Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali.
Welcome
Good morning
I’ll leave you the space to congratulate each one as they feel comfortable, because I’m taking a break.
I had an open studio for five hours and I had two hours of ablutions. My father had a day of ablutions.
Qatar is a blessed country with a government and people who deserve this achievement undoubtedly.
I was able to get this opportunity to congratulate and bless Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani
Yes, of course, Lana. You are like this from the field of mathematics and those working in this field and knowing it very well.
Even we
And if we compete, we deserve. When we took six votes and between us and America, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for America.
It's not from the evening because our file is rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, heavily supported let's go to the stadiums.
Some people were afraid that maybe there was something like America.
And perhaps in some countries, these things are already ready, they don't need to prepare fields and prepare some of the special projects for this event.
Urdu is ready.
But they were afraid of this point
Captain Ali, you are great. I expect this to be a very important achievement for the athletes.
I expect him to enter the political economic health track.
They are expensive
What does this achievement mean?
Of course, here’s the translation: It’s a huge accomplishment, especially for us, Khayrians. Even those who aren’t Khayrians saw our joy. How wonderful it was.
Insha’Allah, someone will let me know about this immediately upon the announcement.
"And Allah, I was coming from the workout and we were hearing on the radio..."
We were waiting for him, and he was with me, one of the neighbors.
We were riding in the car and had the radio on.
First, they announced about Qatar and
We shouted both of us, and of course, we closed the opening.
Rafiji ta'alla min al-fataha.
Shouting and the world is the bottom, they're watching our business and the march is with our souls.
We walked a path from the beginning
Praise be to God. It was a very special day, and I expect that all the channels focused on this event to a great extent.
Lana, you are definitely included in this topic.
And especially the sports channels.
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
There were media outlets from many channels around the world.
The main teacher has become really clear, visible on the map, a defined diameter.
I'm also sure that the presence of the player in this team is a very important thing.
And I expect this to be a big responsibility on his shoulders.
What do you think about this point specifically?
Okay, Captain Ali, what specifications does this player need to check in order to qualify for this team?
Now, at more than one sporting event, I come the right way.
And we mean, like, right now we really need to mobilize a strong force.
It means he has the basics and fundamental techniques in football, studied in a thoughtful way.
What rules must be available and the basics that must be available in this player?
I believe professionalism includes everything.
Testimonials for consistent exercise discipline
These are all basic things to help the player put everything he has in the games or in the training sessions.
Understand every stage of it, meaning don't just say it has a special stamp.
She has such a reputation and feeling about it.
From different programs and variety to sports, where do you feel most beautiful, and where do you feel most yourself?
It's beautiful.
You really keep yourself strong, you know that how I’m keeping myself through exercise is the most important thing.
Then you have football, beloved by the fans, followed by everyone, whether you like it or not, when it takes your place, you want to love it.
What confines the journalist to one side only
What restricts you like that, putting you on a specific side?
Love is not a condition, but a step.
All medical sports are beautiful, sports are beautiful.
Ali also means there are a few important things we need to talk about.
I didn't like you coming back like this, being twenty-two years younger to reach
What I wished for this thing.
Of course, everyone wishes for that, especially the World Cup. So, any player...
It means that if one person is just watching the World Cup, they should be happy and content, but it's strange if they are playing in the World Cup.
And I hope they have good expectations, God willing, and this is their chance, God willing.
What word do you want to say from a professional player who is attacking you? What word do you want to say from your heart to them?
Half term and we loved that you were with us.
I swear, it's like I'm currently on leave, but...
He returned to competitions after an 11-year absence from the Gulf Cup Championship.
You are surely beautiful, may God bless you, with a lovely imprint from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
Mashallah, meaning that Qatar’s television has now become like a university, graduating a large number of media professionals.
Our chosen team is a strong one, God willing, it will win many different awards.
Let's talk about something important regarding Al-Assala Club.
What are you doing there? What's up with you? Hopefully, you're feeling alright.
Certainly, praise be to God. Honestly, Am Asala.
Yesterday, of course, and he was with us in the studio, we talked a lot about the players.
I expect that kind of thing from some of the young people who are following us. I still expect they feel like they're part of that group.
Multab
I'm looking at the professional futsal league and the players' participation.
I found my opportunity in the finals regarding a performance or a presentation.
I was able to take my place as the Asian Cup champion with the team, thanks be to God.
I'm feeling good, thank God, with the team.
Sports topic, how can we make it engaging?
How can I get into sports for women, children, and young people?
It connects them together, meaning everything complements the exercise.
You have a presence in various sports fields, but women are excluded from it.
Sports awareness is spreading in our community, for everyone from the young to the old.
It should take about six years until we arrive or ten years until we reach this occasion. I think that's enough time.
We have the new generations coming up.
In my generation, I'm growing up, but in the generation after me, people also need to raise them from a young age to encourage their sports activities.
We have aspirations, a majestic spire that is rarely denied, a large fortress, founder.
Real and number one for the new generation of athletes
Let's just set the intention and launch.
And they love football, specifically.
I don't know how to get the audience to engage and communicate immediately with all the different matches, even between clubs.
"Honestly, the problem is really serious for us in the Qatari league, which unfortunately has very few fans."
But we have this problem, this attendance, you know, the Qatar Union hasn't yet found a solution to attract the crowds.
What is the method we need to use to get them to follow these matches?
It depends on the person themselves, some of them don't like to attend the stadium.
The media plays a key role in the public's retreat.
Now they have implemented the Ticketing System and Point Accumulation System.
Lala is the Union, meaning he has a plan with several steps to attract the crowds.
Some clubs have ways like Rayyan that attract fans, of course Rayyan is rich, so it doesn't need fans.
Some clubs need to make activities and events within the management of the clubs.
The public’s right: Encouraging the public’s right, but I think these means you have.
The youngsters mean the new generation
Their passion is their faith in their abilities, and just as it’s not just material support, moral support is also very helpful.
We are definitely thanking you for this good meeting, Mashallah, you know.
We'd like to get your final words in celebration of this amazing victory, in light of Qatar's win in the 2022 World Cup. Please begin.
We are certain that Qatar has not faltered in the least; on the contrary, it has fulfilled its promises and always keeps its word and is always reliable.
By God, may I have the last word I want to say in this meeting.
And I tell them congratulations and hopefully towards the Imam, hopefully.
Thank you, Captain Qasim, for being a great captain and player, and we wish you all the best, God willing, in your sporting career and in your life as well. May God grant you success, please.
Let's love each other more and more.
Episode topic: Similar talents
And some young people are saying that these songs are really trending right now, but they have a deep and very large history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English lyrics
Today we are going to follow up on this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
And we will get to know them greatly through our meeting that will bring them together live.
Welcome, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of singing has spread throughout the Arab and Gulf region...
Coming from the West and specifically from America, it is rap singing
And before delving into the topic of rap singing
There must be caution in using any word without qualification.
Anyone can rap.
For the book, the words of the song
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details and many more are important, and we will learn about them through two people entering the field strongly.
Make a cute squad
Welcome to Youssef Al-Naeemi and Salman Abdullah Youssef, good morning.
Welcome, Salman, good morning.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program, of course.
And also, of course, through the topic of rap singing
What are you guys involved in the matter, Youssef?
We saw that hip-hop wasn't really present in the streets.
Sweetest
By the tongue of the citizen
It has the dramatic, the sad, and the ones that deal with political topics.
Yes, I am a dude who raps.
And these songs I yearn for are art, one of the arts, just like the plastic arts paint a painting; the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing while the instrumentalist plays any instrument.
There's acceptance from the Qatari community within the Gulf community for this type of song.
Two thousand and ten
You get the feeling that people are starting to buy rap music headphones.
Different ages
And there are families, and there are also many people who are now hearing more than before.
So there was something like a website
And how many of you are in this unit so far?
Everyone can say words and write poetry and recite them in a rap style.
The rapper, as you say, you can say that whoever sings about himself
He is the one who sometimes plays music and he is the one who composes the words.
Oh, okay.
I hear it and I swear to God, I recorded this song.
Now all these songs you produced from Salman from yousef from anyone from the band itself
I wasn't thinking that it would be available in this specific box for sale in the markets.
But you know that when you're a character, like, I go and make an album and put it on the market, and that's difficult – a business record and procedures, you know?
Why didn't you guys think about it? You're twenty-two, so you're always—one hand can't clap.
You all have five and twenty hands, may God protect you all, you young people and brothers.
Please work with this CD. This CD can be promoted through more than one internet website.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, and you also have it through local newspapers
There are thirteen songs, I think.
Registration is not now.
It was a little vague, but he meant it clearly.
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not the same as before, but it's clear.
And it is approximately fifty CD DVDs.
It means that I can't say there isn't because some young men might have known this art for ten years.
I'm registering and I expect the distribution during this period now, it's different.
And especially because there is a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music now.
These are young men, and these are the artists who produce a large number of beautiful songs.
Also, we're going to talk about the parties you attended.
And Allah, look, the party that I participated in Doha with us was a solo show.
Of course, the club Al Sadd organized it for us, they stopped treating us badly.
The audience is waiting.
We're seeing something we didn't expect this number to mean.
And we were surprised by him that the families are more.
Families are more than youth.
From to and was an organization, meaning awesome.
We were grilling, confused, and it was the first time in Doha.
It means we expected no demand.
The audience interaction was amazing.
And for a long time, the benefits of songs were…
Let's hear something or words from one of the songs he wrote, maybe something that the audience liked and was specifically appreciated by young people.
Let's hear some of the words too, and I'll explain them to the viewers.
And maybe we can hear it on the air.
Please, feel free to help yourself.
Take care, Salim
I’m the problem is the words “ashwayeh” meaning…
Let's hear it.
My mother
We're live with Sabah Doha program.
I wake up with an open mood.
Salman has been rapping for five years now, like a mountain.
Even if he doesn't accept being poor.
I got a lot of people on my phone.
I need to write some words.
What songs did you guys sing, like give me a sentence from one of the sentences you said, for example
She's saying that not all the songs are random, you know. He said it now, and it's called "Free Style" in English.
means on the same weight
But when we sing a song, you know, the words really sink in when you listen carefully.
Thank you, let's continue following it.
We can say good morning, my country, good morning, Qatar, with the program Good Morning Doha
Stay present, be there, be visible, rising up immediately for the viewers.
They’ll see 1 1 2 1, they’ll get a little excited about the arts.
Doha Morning Program
Of course, the beautiful song you saw.
I'm insisting right now that the young people upstairs say it exists online and is everywhere.
Does it really work for you when you registered it?
Shared she was, a shared one.
Each one among us and each one among others, deserves their own right.
I feel like Joseph isn't really able to accept my words or anything, or that he can't really put them into practice.
Everyone takes words.
We are sure, I mean, we expect that every artist and every painter and every poet always
He can also write about the love of sports.
In love with the homeland itself
I’m sure you participated in the National Day march.
Through your beautiful songs, as Qatari youth, do you also relate, Qatar?
Doha is getting ready to welcome the AFC Asian Cup, and there is a long walkway along the Corniche.
To attend this event
And we are transferring these shots for reception, of course.
Doha hosts the Asian Cup
From Doha Airport to An
And we will follow these shots live on air.
Let's uproot it with ourselves and the presence of these crowds and these children, our students, you know.
And I arrived at Doha Hamad International Airport for the Asian Games to complete
Preparations for hosting the grand continental event
Let's go back to visit our guests, Youssef and Salman, who decorated the studio.
Obsessive Arab Gulf regional Arabic rap factions are correct.
We can say that about you because
And Allah, I mean, we are currently, you know.
I’m probably going to the party, but not for sure.
But now you guys are working on a specific party and they will announce it hopefully, Youssef.
Inshallah, but basically it's not certain yet, at least for now. The beginning is a long one.
To start this journey, we wish you all the best and are confident that our program will support you, God willing, with all our hearts.
Also, meaning Salman, where are you all working together as young people of twenty-five?
Where is the listening item and how do you put the ideas how do you write them with each other
It definitely has to be in shared songs
It's not necessary that someone like Salman or Youssef or anyone of them sings a complete song.
It needs to be in harmony with each other wherever you collaborate, whenever you collaborate.
"Listen, it's really difficult to gather all twenty-five of them at once."
So I started talking to Joseph and I talked to Afalan and I talked to them so that today we might be able to meet in a place
So I can get an idea of the song and the lyrics
And in the second minute after
Register the Li on me
He threw it at him while he was finishing.
This will be Youssef's turn to score, and I'll go and get a shawty for me.
Check out the experiences that are available abroad
You mean you buy some of the ideas of great artists.
You should take an expert barbecue, they mean by some techniques.
Yes, of course, we are always, you know.
The artists who have been in this field for years, or who have experience and have been in this field
One hears them with their ridiculous methods, their ways, they try to create a style, at least not by imitating.
It means I won't be able to if I copy his style, his tone of voice, and the level of words.
I'm just imitating, I'm just imitating. I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something special for myself.
We use them just for that.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large number of young people from the Gulf region in the Gulf itself.
With a simple style, we follow this report together and also benefit from and enjoy seeing this report with each other.
The haze still clings to that gift that many people possess.
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Da'il
Riyadh, which is located near the Saudi capital
One hundred and fifty kilometers
He possesses superior abilities and vast experience.
Revealing the locations of surface groundwater.
And in depths exceeding one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is expensive
But with the expert, he can determine the appropriate place to dig the well.
Of course, the method of discovering or
Locating the water
She has been since ancient times.
And they were the oldest fathers and ancestors.
They use news to determine the locations of wells
For digging
Abu Ibrahim's means of discovering water
They are not new devices.
And an analysis of the soil in scientific laboratories
He relies entirely on Allah’s will.
And its drains under the ground.
They are pomegranate sticks.

It starts now, returning to the old ways, this is the end of the stream.
Come back again
Come back
It returns return the an now this if from from here returns numm mark
And from here the course of the water ends.
It requires great experience and a lot of patience.
In order for the discoverer to access the sensitivity of the tools' movement.
I went to more than one area.
It means 99 percent success.
Of course, here’s the translation: “This is the method and the method of using copper rods.”
And of course, he doesn't know a precise scientific explanation.
This method
It is astonishing that the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
It exceeds ninety-five percent.
Revealing the locations of shallow groundwater
SubhanAllah, Allah has taught man what he did not know. This is a report, of course, that we took from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They made the worry a special division, and they had more than one CD.

But I’m confirming the band’s name

It addresses many psychological issues among young people.
But Youna is in the studio two
They will definitely finish the five and twenty.
Welcome again, Abuyoussef and Salman, welcome again.
Once the subscription stopped
We are trying to reach the company, but we don't know where the company is and no one is responding to us.
I need to develop myself, at least as much as the one who is abroad.
Facebook YouTube
These kinds of websites
Band name
We always receive stock.
Let's arrange it as we saw, with each one, may God be pleased with you, you did this work.
You guys make these songs that you put together from a collection of pictures, pictures of you, you're a personality.
And you can download it on YouTube, and you can download it on websites where videos that one might follow might be available.
And there was a dwelling before us.
And in many songs, you know.
The obstacles you're facing are that there's no platform that needs a company to adopt you.
You really need a place that brings you together as a team.
May your wishes come true, so you truly wish and achieve the noble level you desire.
We’ve got it under control.
He tells us, "Let's, we're counting for you, we're organizing for you, we're dropping you a new album."
Ikon means something, it means something official.
It means it's a period of five years now.
It means a little bit, or maybe just a few.
Yes, please share with us about things. Share about programs. Share about series.
I wish to develop and become...
It means something, it supports us, we should always be with it.
Yes and also I want to know also your wishes Salman, not wishes Yusuf, what can you say?
The only wish is to watch the video clip
Inshallah, we wish you all the best. God willing, through this team.
Kindness and we hope, Inshallah, your songs are always present in the Arab world and the world.
And indeed, this is an elegant art, a widely heard art.
And it contains messages like you mentioned.

Doha Morning Program
I am struggling to understand this text. It appears to
With the director Nasser Al-Maliki, episode of Qatar Beatz, definitely.
It means again and it can be benefited from at home.
There is a trolley or shopping cart here
Are you asking if someone goes shopping at the supermarket or somewhere else?
Seriously, you can put anything you want in the fridge of the car, anything you want to buy.
Does it have a large screen? It shows you the components of this product.
This is also an idea that was wonderful and applicable.
It just means that a Barackot Escan is working in the car and revealing this item.
And it gives the buyer it's easier to make the purchase
And take full details on a dedicated screen
I expect it to be like this in a healthier way.
When you have a device with you, with the same car.
More components
And what are the warnings, and what are their harms too?
It contains all the details, you know.
He's ambitious, you know, like he was involved in a number of projects, maybe four or five.
Address traffic problems
It addresses traffic congestion and other parking problems, and was also very creative and lovely, you know.
MashaAllah, also the Children's Cultural Center
Let’s let Mr. Abdullah know that we’d also like to talk about the different activities we’ll see hopefully in the coming days.
Yes, of course, with surprises, of course, but it passed quickly.
The ideas may if you like mention them from each of the projects that they were exposed to.
Here's an example, for instance, the core idea behind this is intelligent or creative mobility underground – it’s…
Everyone who leaves their house means a turn.
They gather at a specific point.
This is, of course, all the pictures that people are seeing and following. I expect they'll enjoy them.
Children's Creations
Exactly yes, like this, for example, in the same K cash مشين.
For example, for women I have a card
Enter this card, I'll say for example, need a black t-shirt
This is, like, now going to some stores, or like, I have some things missing at home, like a key, I don't know what.
What I got, for example, are office keys, office keys
Of course, we have a main goal that Her Highness, Sheikha Moza, wanted.
His Highness’s domain
A short time and early timing are of utmost importance in project design.
Also, a child was chosen from among three hundred children.
Then we also have promising orators in Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony gala as a presenter.
We really want to open our hearts and doors to all the children who want to present their programs.
And then they set off.
We also need this support, and their presence is a top priority for us.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
Despite their differences and diversity in skills
Self-development
Well, do you have a collaboration with some different youth clubs?
There are also, you know, scientific clubs that exist in Qatar.
We are, of course, building all of our programs on partnerships.
All of our programs are specialized partnerships.
Also, we have community service organizations specialized in developing these skills.
He is in partnership with all the institutions interested in the field.
Association Photographic Society
The Al-Fataeh Center for Girls' Creativity, affiliated with the General Secretariat of the Cabinet, also played a very significant role.
Yes, he played a big role in explaining Qatar’s vision.
Training children on it
And attracting and encouraging children in all of our programs are built on founding partnerships
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions
What’s different about you?
Of course, being here in Katara has given us a strong boost and a huge amount of support.
Faster shape
Now, we have a number of projects in partnership with Katara currently being prepared for launch, hopefully within the next two months.
Of course, there is collaboration in many programs.
Specifically, the things related to reading
President of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We're currently in a situation, especially now, during a time of preparation.
And building a promising scientific future for all children and future generations and young people, God willing.
The word I want to tell to parents and young people who follow us, and children who want to be present through the center.
What we are giving now
Our children have ideas that we don't dismiss or belittle.
We must give it attention no matter what these ideas are.
He really means he's interested in this idea, and this idea will definitely develop. At the very least, it will develop a love for children into thinking.
This is very important for me to take care of.
Connect with him spiritually. Connect with him now. Our big problem is that most fathers
He provides him with support.
He receives encouragement from parents and educators.
They should pay more attention to their imagination, children of today are our future, they are the basis of that future.
It means that we really lived while wandering through this exhibition among their projects.
We were living in a dream
It's like a dream of ideas, all very imaginative and expansive.
And now the dream certainly means a reality. There are many dreams that have come true and become a reality.
Praise be to God, and we wish our children who were present all the best.
May Allah reward you with goodness, and may He accept from you, insha'Allah.
With his permission
From all ages and genders
Reached 70 projects
Consider projects that are pioneering and new in implementation.
To discuss this matter further
National and also for the Cultural Center for Childhood.
Professor Abdullah also, at the beginning, means like this, we briefly talked about the presentation.
What it contains brings together many, surely from events, what can we say briefly about this performance?
It became a new pattern in expressing children's love, loyalty, and belonging to the homeland.
Of course, it came under the sponsorship of the Minister of Education and the Minister of Higher Education and Education.
In a tour of the palace, this official appeared.
It's getting bigger with him until it reaches twenty thirty
We started by training children to see a diameter of twenty thirty with its five axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, and environmental development
First, he knows now that Qatar is twenty thirty and where it will reach.
Then he starts to think about how is the way of thinking
How to create and how to be, to come out with creative ideas
I expect something like that, you know, his field is vast, may God bestow blessings upon him.
But when we give it these specific symbols and help it
I expect his thinking to grow even more and more.
Professor, you launched the vision under the slogan of so-and-so's name, Dreams of Generations, Facts of Tomorrow.
It is the dream of generations today.
He will be part of the future of Qatar.
And indeed, we noticed this while we were walking with the children when the child speaks, he says, "This is happiness, like the Minister's joy."
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project at twenty thirty.
The child is thinking about the future, in twenty years.
He expresses his love for his homeland and what he loves from the field.
It is definitely accompanied by various activities and competitions.
And they were the winners of the Cosmos Prize.
And also among the winners of the first prize of the League of Arab States
Of course, all children
And on the margin of the statement, there was a statement meaning there were different statements with a specific table.
They presented their projects that they carried out during the period.
What a wonderful turnout!
Stars of Science
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition
The woman who also won one of the major awards
The forest or the reserve
We also want to talk about the colored hatred.
The multicolored, of course, we were also part of the vision and the children's dream of Qatar's future.
I'm also thinking about December twenty-two and twenty-three.
How can a child contribute to an innovative idea project for twenty-two and thirty years?
Her main idea is that a slice should be present on the globe.
It turns color when judged.
If she goes, for example, to Amazon, then everyone monitors the referee's movements of this football through
And the movements of the field and what changes through this electronic slice.
Anyone who is in the world
Ideas, of course, definitely creative, that’s the main idea. It might surprise you, many people ask us
And these projects
We always didn't manage to connect with the children
In this stage of forming or developing these skills, they broaden their horizons.
Who gave them the idea for this method of expressing love for the homeland through these projects?
Who gave them self-confidence? How will he present his project to the public and explain his idea?
In the field of his interests in this SAI love, this is a success achievement for for
And he provided support, support that he appreciated and thanked me for.
Now you are entering development stages and
With support from several officials and support from the committee, and I expect support also from the public.
The forest was not the second because this child
Method of entry for subscribers, channels, pipes, the ducts that visitors enter under the ground.
A large protected forest
The visitor wanders around and sees the animals, sorry, the reptiles under the ground.
In Sensor on some animals and a research center that measures their condition.
And in the marine environment and entering it also creatively
The reason for her victory is also the extensive imagination, meaning every detail.
This is, of course, deserving of...
Of course, anyone who talks about a tourist city under the sea, under the water.
In speaking about the City of Butterflies
In those who speak of a forest, a forest above the earth.
Who talks about many tourism ideas
It's exciting.
Perhaps this is something that children's minds are like this at this time, perhaps in the year 2000 or 2050.
And and in the future, perhaps these things will really happen.
It means there are three projects.
The scientific club didn't adopt her projects, said she needs these projects now, I want to work on them.
A project like the one related to air conditioning and water.
Let's look at Al-Arabiya newspaper now.
And the news says that Qatar University is celebrating the graduation of
In the presence of His Excellency Sheikh Sa'ad bin Ibrahim Al Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Education
Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Munsad, University President

The artist Abdel Hamid Al-Shershni is considered among the artists who formed themselves.
If it wasn't convincing
I would not have been chosen to be present in the works being carried out in Qatar.
Currently, artist Abdel Hamid Al-Sherini is participating in the series "Killer Feeling" and "Al-Tasaneef Part 2".
We are pleased to have you as our guest this morning.
Let's talk to him about his participation in these two important projects and about his experience in general.
Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, Doha! This is the first time I’m meeting you, and it’s also the first time you’re joining us in the Doha morning show.

Come see them if anyone agrees that you won’t return the thawb.
From me, and of course, I had another question to start with, but since we saw this clip from the first season of the series Tanseeif
Pointing to Khalid bin al-Walid
And some historians attribute the great poet Imru’ al-Qais to the city of Madinah multiple times.
Many matters and information related to this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And for more, we continue with this beautiful report from colleague عبدالrahman Murad.
We are following with some.
And it is certainly a certificate from someone who doesn't know flattery or favoritism.
To confirm the Arabness of this city or that
And as much as we see of its ruins and hear what has been said about it by its narrators and poets
Their past and their present, both will pass, that is a full record that is added to the city’s record.
And a city was mentioned in one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is his old country, historically developed during the pre-Islamic era.
Historians differed on the reason for its naming.
And some attribute it to Amra' al-Qays al-Kindi, the well-known poet.
And the well to which it is attributed
It is unknown when it was established.
The Age of Ignorance
Also, the most famous thing in Medina is Mount Qamih, which is likened to it.
It is located in the city or stuck to it.
The Caves are also archaeological sites.
Given that this teacher is considered a tourist attraction, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Marat, with great efforts, did
From above this mountain
And sessions for the residents and citizens of the kingdom, all of them.
This item is named after the eminent companion Khalid bin al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To combat the renegades and Musaylima the liar
He also excavated the Ghadir spring.
It is a place where streams converge and retains water for a long period.
And among the most important sources of water in the past era
And its associated house of Al-Oudhi for heritage.
Medina dates back to before Islam.
She is renowned for her poets who ignited their poeticism.

We return once again to our esteemed guests
Please inform us and the viewers about these methods and these means.
There was this thing at the beginning, we had a very specific infrastructure.
We'll create a page for him that is logged and has a dedicated file on our system.
His guardian's email
This distraction involves the extent of increased focus, writing speed, adhesion speed, and general distraction.
The guardian is completely corrupted.
This document is added to the student file.
Accessing his son's file online
And he sees how deep his son is in it.
And he sees his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
Even we enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful child.
We’ve brought most of the children who are at the center and we extend to them the most beautiful greetings.
I entered this center with a compliant teacher who was found through this center.
And we will learn about its intelligence and the level it has reached, of course, from its entry into this center.
Of course, the year.
He focuses on work and after Armazan.
But this would obviously be unfair to my work compared to other work all the time.
And some people only see television in Armazan.
He stays up watching television and people with the prayer month template on television.
Light light lighten series lighten let it be done in two years is not better
Of course.
Inshallah, they will accept me in Armazan.
But Inshallah, I send you all my greetings.
And God willing
And also in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion.
A fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
Definitely, we’ll keep going with you with all love and sincerity.
And it develops children's abilities and skills even more.
From various schools to the new homeland, this generous nation.
We have a definite model, we spoke with our guests who were with us.
We’re with Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome, and good morning.
How are you, Ameni?
Praise be to God.
Current status
Mr. Ibrahim, let's start by getting to know the materials that are offered through this center.
And as an example of this, the username
We will also discuss with her the style or method that the teacher Nesma talked about.
I feel like there's a big difference in his mind.
I feel that these skills and these methods
The situation has changed regarding his skills, as well as his mindset, and even his level of education is changing.
Scientific methods
It includes that I initially do a global test called the Toné test for the child before starting anything else I have in the program
Let me start working on the second part of the tone test as well.
Through it, we measure the level of difference in the student's level.
They are currently conducting a test or quick math questions.
Ameni rah hisab wa tijaawab ‘abr al-hawā ‘ala tool.
Of course, Amine never heard of these questions.
We have been discussing this topic.
Of course, I had one more question to start with.
I ask you about your participation this year in the second competition.
What are you telling about it?
Of course, after we presented a series of classifications.
Of course, thanks be to God. God has guided me in many roles.
Mr. Ghanem
The roles are distributed, of course, with Ashraf Shحاته as the director and the esteemed professor.
Of course, this is an opportunity from Tar Production House.
Honestly, for the youth
Professor Ghanem, of course, this year he nominated me for maybe
Of course, every episode is different.
I have like ten episodes where I'm going to do character roles.
And conversely, this is a nice experience, of course, and there is work available.
My pyramid is the pyramids of Kuwait by Mr. Saad Al Faraj
We have artists from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik Al Ghareer.
Like Mirza, we have a saying
With you, there is also a group of young Abdullah Adham.
We have another young man, Abdullah Al-Asam.
This is the end of the year and we work two projects a year.
It may be that this is the reason you are feeling this way since seven years ago.
But I didn't realize that achieving your dream and ambition is through art.
Praise be to God for all.
You are right, art is a study or just a mere hobby.
I didn't take it as a gift.
I took art as a gift, of course. The one who supported me at the beginning, the artist Abdulaziz Jassim, of course.
I am considered by some as a son to them, among the artists.
I have something to say.
Of course, all the series we have.
We pulled together and, thank God.
Now if Lula Tara Shukr big thank to Professor Ab al Rahman Al-Sultiti big big thank to Professor Ab al Rahman
You would be like Kuwait, where every year from 12 to 18, new actors come out.
In them
Certainly, thank you very much means you are giving opportunities.
Let’s just talk.
We're talking about the series of Sanay Classification. We had an idea about it.
The deadly feeling cello
And the foot also a man's foot.
And we have a definite model, with the processor, Professor Abdulaziz Al-Meewoof Al-Tamimi.
This operation will be performed live.
And I see how it's possible to treat the character, for example, first let me become like Mr. Sabah Abdullah, may God bless him.
Welcome! Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy.
If we start with you, professor, please proceed.
By God's will
Bismillah, of course.
We are holding the hand.
We're losing it.
It’s like a drawing or a message from God, the Almighty, revealing all the parts of your body.
From the inside, what are the problems?
I get dizzy sometimes.
Headache and dizziness
Put your hand down, calm your nerves.
Professor Abdulaziz will discover a specific ailment through his examination that he is suffering from.
The person on the left has inflammation in the middle ear.
What does this mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
Do you have a problem with your ear?
Who created me when I was young
Here you can feel it too.
The inguinal pockets
I'm feeling a headache here.
I have a headache here.
This is a problem with the bowels.
It is causing eye strain.
Weight gain without eating
The doctor says you're feeling weak and tired, you always feel sluggish and heavy-bodied.
Excessive sleep
Too much sleep or the body's laziness, it always feels heavy.
tonsillitis is always
There, look, notice the tremor.
He's got a habit, and of course, you never walk barefoot, maybe the last time
The man from Tunisia
Mashallah, you're giving us amazing things about his presence and...
Does this massage also work for children?
Pain is a right of the mother. Glory to God, according to the size of the mother’s belly, as the child’s hand is tucked in.
How often do our children go there?
When you remove him, it's not that he likes to be carried. People think he likes to be carried, but he actually has gas and bloating, may God bless you.
Just as the matter is clarified, this simplifies the ambiguity.
Ikon fi batn yid al-child
Hands interviews icon child counterpart
Let's just see, even every mom can learn this move.
It's getting tough like this, right and left, right and left.
This is something about the child and about the about the child, it's cute.
Well, regarding the discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women.
It means, as we said, in every house, 99 percent, may God protect them from women.
First, level and smooth the ceramic and tile floors.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, of course, our problem is that when we hold onto the rope, we walk barefoot, it might be dangerous to just walk on even surfaces.
Walk barefoot or if there was no ceramic in the houses, problems increased health-wise.
إنّ الأرظ باردة ومتساوية
When I was a carpet seller, there were problems I complained about asthma.
Increased
The teenager is focused on walking barefoot on her heels.
This part of the old sole, the heel area of the sole, from the back of the heel.
From here, this foot when below the heel
This is the first discovery, the second discovery, on its way to facilitating childbirth.
Just focus really hard.
In the seventh or ninth month
As soon as the start of labor is generally
It means that the ice at 8 AM is dangerous, and the scariest thing is that she's walking barefoot.
The pregnant woman should pay attention to walking barefoot.
If you go into the birth canal
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Tremble before God, O my eyes! Let him shake you, That the tree of Nahl (Honey Bee) may be shaken, And its fruits may fall upon you in torrents.
We know that Mary, upon whom be peace, was a gift from God to her.
Look, even to the extent that scholars of knowledge discussed it, they asked why the interpretation of Ibn al-Khatib changed.
I don't know myself, I'm giving you the idea that God put in this science and it inspires me.
Shake the trunk of the palm tree when the palm tree is shaken, of course, how it came.
Sharp like a knife, like they told me it was like nails or screws.
And when the date palms were shaken, he gave orders to his relatives who were harsh, making them harsh in the text here.
She who is the internal organs gave orders to facilitate childbirth, modify the fetus.
The baby's head circumference or something that adjusts to the length and comes out normally.
Glory be to God, this fruit has many benefits.
Hold the hand and guide it.
Some are taking it as a habit, and some are realizing it’s truly knowledge.
They're afraid to tell you and what do you think of them?
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, I mean, Mashallah, your discoveries are important.
I just wanted to know the last question, the time is going by so fast, by the Grace of God.
One who wants to contact you, anyone who wants to contact you, a specific email – are you?
Okay, here's the translation: Okay, the mobile is in the control room. If you want to contact Professor Abdulaziz, please call us after the program.
Of course, television numbers, screen size, until they contact us and take this number.
I was only created to serve humanity.
If you believe that God will bless you in your work and make people happy
I err like people do, and I do everything, meaning everything you wouldn't even think to consider a normal person would.
We aspire to goodness more than
I always think positively.
Our viewers, God willing, enjoyed this paragraph as well, of course, through reflexology and massage by hand.
Foot access
We found a live model on air. How does the person we're with discover what ailments it has?
What is suffering if we wish for information, and whoever wants can definitely contact him. He may also read about him through the internet.
How to apply it, if in the coming days and years, if it will include more schools
Good morning.
How could he experience this?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The reality is that obesity is a big problem in the Gulf countries.
We've learned that Qatar is running the fifth state with them.
And this program means is transparency that happened that the First Lady in New York
She came to Doha and they had a program for that.
They offered us and we built it for us, no problem.
He means our students with students from New York with students from Spain with students from England.
And we want to know about our brothers, our students in Qatar, how their level compares to students around the world, and this is something we want. We are the future.
Because we encourage eating fruit, you know, among the students.
He stopped playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week and family meal with the family.
Of course, this is like two birds talking in a stone.
Of course, here's the translation: "Obviously, the sixth week he gained from this experience. We are, thankfully, concluding today."
We are happy with our studies.
They were three independent schools, Abu عبیده.
Noble, elevated girls
Our morale is high.
The family is conscious/aware, their siblings are excited at home, they started eating this food like them.
It has become a reciprocal relationship between students and this scarf is even transferred to their families.
He's eating, and they are saying that I am an example like this and they taught me this way.
The training session or the person who was giving this information to the students
How did you choose them? How were the students contacted through whom?
Yes, we truly thank God for them, many times, in various ways, with many organizations that pleased us.
And we have the brothers who taught them about Weight Watchers, they taught them about healthy eating too.
And learn with Ms. ‘Ashah al-Tamimi about etiquette, etiquette, and dining.
How do they organize it? How do they eat? How do they prioritize?
For teaching cooking or sports or awareness in the field of healthy food.
She was in the form of separate lessons and neither a curriculum nor
How did I convey these ideas to my students?
In a diverse way, some of it was inside the school.
We started the program with one day at Inspire Zone, gathering all students, boys and girls.
Because this topic doesn't concern a specific person, it concerns us all, because these are our children.
They are guiding the students on how they used to do things at the beginning with
You mean the results were satisfactory.
But is three schools or specific classrooms from those schools enough?
Now we are, of course, the first experience in the world when things start, they don't start on a large scale.
It starts off well and reasonably, with all the qualities of boy, girl, and independent individuals.
Because it doesn't align with, for example, our culture, our environment, the circumstances of families, families, etc., they accept things for their children that they don't accept.
Fibonacci numbers are actually, they are involved in them and they are really important.
The student, at the age of twelve or thirteen, considers this time appropriate because he knows about his health.
This is suffering for so many people, and God wants to be weak, but to imagine it's impossible.
Some of the heroes we see in movies are like that and have weak bodies, and this means it’s as if they’re mythical.
We discussed in detail, but unfortunately, there were many weeks and we didn't have time to cover everything.
It might be possible to remind them about Doha through Doha Mornings as well.
And the fruits that contain, you know, vitamin B, the ones you can take from fruits or vegetables.
Now the person knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, he begins to improve his health, which gives him morale.
In the fruit section, they were going to the supermarket and choosing their fruit.
This is an example point.
Of course, here’s the translation: “So, diversification, they competed – every school that excelled in its school with innovative ideas.”
The spirit of competition is the spirit of...
We're giving them the general picture and everyone can create their own interpretation.
The teachers who trained the students, and there isn’t a special team with you.
We are training them
So, the teachers were adding, like, some schools, such as Abu Abidah, said that on Saturday we'll do activities for the students.
Today, outside of school hours, they decided to adopt Razi School. They said it would be a long journey.
Let's make a healthy cooking day like sisters, okay? We didn't want the boys to cook healthy food themselves, because the girls had more skills in this matter.
Thank you to Miyah Raya for providing complete water to schools for free. Miyah Raya is involved in this matter.
Of course, that means healthier water because it will need to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter its body daily through water.
This week we said the third.
It means he is now moving his body.
It's possible they can play soccer or volleyball, but they don't know that this sport is what I love.
Absolutely correct and some of them might want other games, some of them might not want multiplayer games.
Live
Mr. السيد عبدالعزيز الجابر, founder and director of the National Multiple Sclerosis Patients Association, welcome.
And of course, we try as much as possible to focus on the most important topics.
We wanted to get to know and find out what the beloved viewers of the multiple sclerosis disease are experiencing.
And this term may also seem a bit strange to you. Please.
The number of women infected is more than the number of men.
All currently available treatments are preventative treatments.
White blood cells that are supposed to protect us start fighting each other.
We fought with cell damage.
The simplest explanation for the public is an electrical wire.
Coated with a layer called Melinex to wipe it off. It is a nylon layer.
Of course, here's the translation: Naturally, this generally leads to imbalance, duplication of vision, and blurred vision.
It leads to problems in the digestive system and respiratory system.
It can lead to madness in its worst cases, leading to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments
The most important functions in the human body that can be severely disrupted.
Oh, what is this disease called multiple sclerosis?
Theories suggest it's a viral transfer.
It is not contagious.
And it does not pass to the children
Some consider it a disease according to the region.
But the equator, for example, was completely distant from this disease.
Currently, we have cases on the equator affected by this disease.
This disease, so far, doesn't have a cure because it's not known what causes it.
Until now, scientists have not been able to reach the cause of the disease in order to find a cure for it.
The current process is an inverse process.
They are trying to avoid the effect of the disease itself on the human body.
They are trying to start from the back, meaning other wise.
And maybe we'll be a little afraid of this topic, which we can say maybe this disease comes suddenly.
There's a specific group of people who feel this disease is spreading in a certain age range.
I am a global citizen, a writer who has been compiling for twenty lines to forty years.
Currently, the International Organization of the Sick has lowered the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because the old hunter has been afflicted with illness for forty years.
But it does not heal from a human being.
Of course, we can, as a link, we are open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, if by his link, the national association for multiple sclerosis patients.
What is the reason for the existence of this organization?
That’s a large collection, so you thought there might be a connection to this topic.
Of course, I’ll give you the exact numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are 18,000 cases.
1000 injured
The rest of the Gulf countries see infection rates ranging from one hundred to three hundred.
I was diagnosed five years ago.
My number is forty-four or sixty-four.
Are there any symptoms that indicate to a person that he actually has this disease?
And we don't have confirmation that it's a virus, so we don't want to adopt a specific theory. This is a point.
Point two. How do I know if I am infected or not?
This is very difficult.
I contacted you, Mr. Abdulaziz, through an attempt to find a specific point.
