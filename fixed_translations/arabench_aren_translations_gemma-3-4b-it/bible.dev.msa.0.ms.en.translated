There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the time of the exile, and fourteen generations from the time of the exile to the Messiah. The genealogy of Jesus Christ.
The birth of Jesus Christ took place as follows: His mother, Mary, was engaged to a man named Joseph. But before they married, she learned that she was with child by the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph’s wife was righteous, and he did not want to reveal her matter, so he decided to leave her quietly.
While Joseph was contemplating this, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said to him: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to accept Mary, the wife of your betrothal, for the child she bears is of the Holy Spirit.”
You will have a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
This happened in order to fulfill what he said through the prophet.
“Behold, the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which means ‘God with us.’”
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did all that the angel of the Lord commanded him, and he took his wife to his house.
But he didn't know her until she gave birth to the child he named “Jesus.”
Wise men from the East
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, “Where is the child who is born, who is to be the King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him.”
King Herod was disturbed when he heard that, as were all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Herod gathered all the chief priests and teachers of the law, and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, because it was written of by the prophet:
“You, Bethlehem, which is located in the land of Judea, are not insignificant among the rulers of Judah, for from you will come forth a ruler who will pasture my people, the people of Israel.”
And Herodius the Wise summoned them and met with them secretly, and learned from them the exact time when the star appeared.
Then he sent them to the city of Bethlehem and said, “Go and search for the child. And when you find him, tell me, so that I may also come and worship him.”
The wise men listened to the king, then they departed. And as a star that they had seen in the east was following them, it came and stood over the place where the child had been.
They rejoiced with great joy when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with Maryam, his mother, and they knelt on the ground, prostrating themselves before him. Then they opened their chests of treasure and presented him with gifts: gold and incense and musk.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they traveled to their country by another route. Escape to Egypt
And after the wise men had traveled, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him, “Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod will seek to destroy the child.”
Joseph took the child and his mother at night and went to Egypt.
And he remained there until Herod’s death. This happened to fulfill what the Lord spoke by the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” #From… my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11: 1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he became very angry and ordered the killing of all the boys in the city of Bethlehem and all the surrounding region, from the age of two years and under, according to the time that the wise men had told him.
Then, what was said by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
A sound was heard in Ramah, a sound of weeping and great lamentation. It was the sound of Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are dead. Return from Egypt.
After Herod died, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
He said to him, “Rise up, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”
Joseph went and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had become king in the region of Judea instead of his father Herod, he feared to go there. And after God warned him in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
He lived in a town called Nazareth. This was to fulfill what the prophets said about the Messiah being called Nazareth. #Nazareth. 23:2 Referring to the town of Nazareth. It is also a word that resembles the Hebrew word meaning “branch,” found in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the Messiah coming from David’s line.
John the Baptist
In those days, John the Baptist came to preach in the wilderness of Judea.
And he would say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”
And John said, “This is the one who spoke to Moses at the burning bush, and said to him, ‘I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ Do not fear, for I am with you; do not let your heart be troubled.” He said this so that they might believe that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. And John testified saying, “I did not see the light, but I heard a voice saying to me, ‘What is born of water knows not the fire.’ “
John wore garments of camel’s hair, and a leather belt over them; he ate figs and honey.
At that time, all people began to come from Jerusalem and from the whole of the Jewish territory, and from the region surrounding the Jordan River to hear it.
And they would baptize them in the Jordan River after they had confessed their sins.
And when John saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to be baptized, he said to them, “You sons of vipers, who has told you to flee from the wrath to come?”
Make a fruit that proves your repentance.
Do not boast that you are the descendants of Abraham, saying, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you, God is able to make you his children without him leaving behind any descendants.
Here is the axe placed on the roots of the trees. And every tree that does not bear a good fruit will be cut down and burned.
I give you water for the washing of your repentance. But he who comes after me is greater than I, and you are not worthy to cast even one stone under his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He will carry his burdens in his hand and purify them with his sword, he will gather his treasures in the storehouse, and burn the hay with a fire that will not be extinguished. Jesus’s baptism
Then Jesus came from the Galilee region to the Jordan River, because he desired to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him and said, “I need to be baptized by you, why do you come to me?”
Jesus replied, “Let it be done now, for it is right in the eyes of God, that we should fulfill his will.” Then John allowed him to do it.
Then Jesus deliberately went into the water. And as he came up from the water, heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending in the form of a dove and settling upon him.
And a voice came from heaven saying, “You are my beloved son. I am pleased with you completely.”
Jesus's experience
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, to be tempted by Satan.
After Jesus had abstained from eating for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
The sorcerer came to him #the sorcerer. 3:4 meaning Satan. And said to him: “If you are the Son of God, say to these stones that they become bread.”
But Jesus answered, “The scripture says, ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
Then Satan took him to Jerusalem and caused him to stand on the summit of the temple.
He said to him, “If you are truly the Son of God, then hurl yourself from here. For the Scripture says, ‘God commands his angels to guard you.’ And they will say, ‘We will lift you up on our hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus replied, “The Scriptures also say, ‘Do not tempt the Lord your God.’”
Then Satan took him to a high mountain, and displayed before his eyes all the kingdoms of the world and their greatness.
Then he said to him, “I will give them all to you if you bow to me.”
Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’”
Then Satan left him, and the angels came to serve him. Jesus began his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth, but he went and settled in the town of Cana near the Sea of Galilee, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened to fulfill what was said by God through the prophet Isaiah:
The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, beside the sea, beyond the Jordan, east of the river, in the land of the Palestinians—where gifts of goodwill are distributed by the Lord.
The people living in darkness saw a great light, those sitting in the land of the shadow of death. Light has shone upon them.
From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Jesus chose some of his disciples.
While Jesus was going along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was also called Peter, and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the lake, and they were fishermen.
He said to them: “Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of men.”
They left their net there and followed him.
Then Jesus went on from there, and saw two other brothers, James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. He saw them in a boat with their father Zebedee mending their nets, and he called them.
They left the boat and their father, and followed Him. Jesus was teaching and healing.
And Jesus was traveling throughout all the Galilean region, teaching the people in synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of God’s kingdom. And he was healing all the sick and all that were afflicted among them.
The news of him spread throughout all of Syria, and all the sick patients with various diseases and pains, tormented by evil spirits, afflicted with epilepsy and paralyzed, came to him, and Jesus healed them.
And it was followed by a large crowd of people who came from the Galilee region, and from the ten cities, and from Jerusalem, and from the Judean region, and from the eastern side of the Jordan River.
Jesus' teaching
And when Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on a hill and sat down. Then His disciples came to Him.
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
Congratulations to the poor ones in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven has been given to them.
Congratulations to the newlyweds, for God will comfort them.
Congratulations to the humble, for they shall inherit the earth. #inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37: 11. It may here refer to a future spiritual inheritance.
Congratulations to the hungry and the thirsty for doing God’s will, #for doing God’s will. 6:5 Literally: “To the Elect.” Because God will satisfy them.
Congratulations to the merciful, for God will have mercy on them.
Congratulations to those with pure hearts, for they will see God.
Congratulations to those who establish peace, for they will be called the sons of God.
Congratulations to the oppressed for the sake of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven has been given to them.
Congratulations to you when people insult and persecute you, and accuse you of wickedness because you are my disciples.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. For they persecuted also those prophets who were before us. Salt and light
You are the salt of humanity in general. But if the salt loses its taste, what shall we do to restore it to its former worth? It will not be useful afterward except to be thrown out of the house, to be trodden underfoot by feet.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden.
And people don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl! But they put it on a raised stand so that it shines on all who are in the house.
“Moreover, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” – Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to give them their full meaning.
I tell you the truth, until the heaven and the earth pass away, not the smallest letter or point will be erased from the Law, until all that is written therein is done.
Therefore, whoever breaks the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys these commandments and teaches others to obey them will be considered the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Because I tell you that unless you increase your obedience to God above the obedience of your teachers of the law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Wrath
You know that it was told to your fathers: ‘Do not murder. #Do not murder. 21:5 from Exodus 20:13, and Deuteronomy 5:17. And whoever murders deserves judgment.’
As for me, I tell you that whoever is angry with another person deserves to be tried, and whoever insults another person should stand before a court. And whoever says to another person, ‘You idiot,’ deserves hell.
So, if you are offering a sacrifice on the altar, and you remember that someone else has something against you,
Leave your progress there in front of the altar, and go and first reconcile with that person, then return and present your progress.
Save your discount quickly, while you walk with him to the courthouse. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, and he will throw you into jail.
I'm telling you the truth, you won't get out of there until you've paid the last penny of your debt. Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, 'Do not weigh.' #Do not weigh. 27:5 From the Book of Exodus 20: 14, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5: 18.
But as for me, I tell you: whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed zina (adultery) in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye leads you to sin, pluck it out and cast it away from you. It is better to lose one of your body parts than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
And if your right hand drives you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better to lose one limb from your body than to have your whole body cast into hell. Divorce.
It was also said: ‘If a man divorces his wife, let him write a certificate of divorce.’ #if a man divorces… that. 31:5 From the Book of Deuteronomy 24: 1.
As for me, I tell you that whoever divorces his wife except for the reason of adultery, he exposes her to committing adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman, he commits adultery. Verse
You have heard that it was also said to your fathers, ‘Do not swear by false witness, nor by your own soul; but, ‘Swear to your God.’ 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, and Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But as for me, I tell you: never swear at all.
Do not swear by the heaven, for it is God’s throne, nor by the earth, for it is His footstool. #HisFootstool. 35:5 Meaning, He is within it, and under His dominion. Nor by Jerusalem, the city of the Great King.
Don't swear on your head, for you cannot make a single hair on it black or white.
If you want to say ‘yes,’ say ‘yes.’ And if you want to say ‘no,’ say ‘no.’ And anything beyond that is evil. #Evil. 37:5 The Devil. Resisting Evil
You have heard that eye for eye and tooth for tooth. #Eye…tooth. 38:5 from the Book of Exodus 21: 24, and the Book of Leviticus 24: 20.
As for me, I say: Do not resist the evil. Indeed, if someone strikes you on your right cheek, offer him the other also.
And if anyone wants to sue you to take your shirt, let him take your coat as well.
And if someone forces you to walk a mile with him, walk with him two miles.
And if someone asks you for something, give it to them. And do not refuse to lend to anyone who asks you to borrow. Love of all.
You have heard that if you love your friend and hate your enemy, you will be blessed. #love… your enemy. 43:5 from the Book of Leviticus 19: 18.
But as for me, I tell you: love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
And you will be the sons of your Father in heaven. For God causes the sun to rise on the righteous and the wicked, and sends rain to the believers and the unbelievers.
If you love those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Don't tax collectors do it too?
And if you are showing love only to your own brothers, what makes you different from others? Do not the worshippers of idols do the same?
Therefore, be complete, just as your heavenly father is complete.
Offer
Beware of offering your charity before people with the intention of gaining their approval, otherwise your father in heaven will not reward you.
And when you give to the needy, do not proclaim it as if you were blowing a trumpet, like the self-righteous in assemblies and in the streets, seeking the praise of people. I tell you truly, they have already received their full reward.
But when you give to the needy, let your left hand not know what your right hand does.
Even if your giving is in secret. And your father who sees what is happening in secret, will reward you. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like those who act like show-offs, for they love to pray in the synagogues and in the streets so that people may see them. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward for that.
But when you pray, enter your room and close your door, and approach your father in secret. And your father who sees what is happening in secret will reward you.
And when you pray, do not say anything without understanding, as do the worshippers of idols, who think that their prayers will be answered because of the abundance of their words.
Therefore, do not be like them, for your father already knows what you need before you ask.
Therefore pray as follows: ‹Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
Let your kingdom come, and let your will be done, here on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our bread of our day.
Forgive us our trespasses, just as we forgive those who sin against us.
And do not test us, but save us from the evil one. #theevilone. 13:6 The Devil (Iblis). For you are the King and the Possessor of power and glory, to eternity and ever. Amen.
And if you forgive the people their faults, your Lord will forgive you – indeed, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.
But if you do not forgive others for their faults, then your father will not forgive your faults. Fasting.
And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites who display their fasting with a false sorrowful look, for they change their appearance so that people may clearly see that they are fasting. I tell you truly, they have received their full reward.
But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face.
So that people don't notice you are fasting. Your father, who doesn't see you, sees it. Then, your father who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. God or money.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither corruption nor rust can reach them, and where thieves cannot reach them or steal them.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The light of the body is the eye. If your eyes are sound, then your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, then your body will also be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness in truth, then what will the darkness within you be like?
No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be fully devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally “Mamona,” which is an Aramaic word meaning “wealth,” in its negative sense, as it represents a god whom people serve without God. The Kingdom of God first.
For this reason I tell you, do not worry about your life, that is, about what you will eat or what you will drink. Do not worry about your body, that is, about what you will wear. For life is more important than food, and the body is more important than clothing.
Look at the birds of the sky, they do not sow or reap, nor do they gather grain into granaries, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than them?
Who among you can add an hour to his age when he is worried?
And why are you worrying about what you’ll wear? Look how the wildflowers grow. They don’t tire, they don’t spin.
But I tell you, no one has been wounded like her, not even Solomon in all his glory.
If God wears the grass of the fields that you see here today, and throws it into the oven tomorrow, will He not take better care of you than that, O little of faith?
So don't worry or ask yourselves: 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
These are matters that the otherworldy people strive for, and your heavenly father knows that you all need them.
But first pay attention to the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and these things will be given to you also.
Don't worry about tomorrow, for each day has its own worries, and tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others
Do not judge others, lest God judge you.
Because he will govern in the way you govern others. And the weight you measure for others will be measured for you.
Why do you see a needle in your brother’s eye, but not the beam in your own eye?
And how can you say to your brother, “Let me remove the splint from your eye,” while there is a plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother’s eye.
Do not give what is sacred to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine! For swine trample them with their feet, and dogs will turn on you and destroy you. Perseverance in asking.
Ask, give, strive, find, knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks, they receive; for everyone who seeks, they find; and for everyone who knocks, the door is opened for them.
Would any of you, if his son asked for a loaf of bread, give him a stone?
Or if a fish is requested, should it be given alive?
You, despite your hardness, know how to bestow good gifts upon your children. Is the Father in heaven not much more deserving to give good gifts to those who seek Him? The Golden Rule
“As you would like others to treat you, so you must treat them. This is the essence of Moses’ law and the teachings of the prophets. The way of heaven and the way of hell.”
Enter through the narrow gate; it is wide open. Because the gate is narrow and the way is hard, and those who go through it know not, because wide is the gate and easy is the way, and many enter through it.
The door to life is very narrow, and the path to it is full of difficulties, and only a few find this path. Warning against false teachings.
Beware of false prophets who come to you in the guise of sheep, but inwardly are wolves.
They will know them by their deeds. For people do not gather grapes from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles!
Moreover, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.
Every tree that does not bear fruit worthy of being cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore, you will know the false prophets by their fruit.
Not everyone who says, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day: ‘O my Lord, O my Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out the demons in your name? Did we not perform many great wonders in your name?’
Then I would say to them clearly: I have never known you. Stay away from me, you evil-doers. The intelligent man and the foolish man
Anyone who listens to these teachings and acts upon them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain fell, the floodwaters rose, and the wind blew, striking that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was on rock.
Anyone who listens to my words and does not act upon them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain fell, the floodwaters rose, and the wind blew, striking that house, causing a torrential collapse!
When Jesus finished this discourse, the people were astonished at His teaching.
Because he was teaching them about the Sultan, not like the Sharia scholars.
Jesus cleanses the leper
Then Jesus descended from the mountain, and a great number followed him.
And a leper came to him and prostrated himself before him, saying, “Lord, you are able to make me clean, if you would.”
Jesus extended his hand and touched him, and said, “Yes, I want you to be cleansed.” Immediately, the leprosy was cured.
Then Jesus said to him, “Do not tell anyone what happened to you, but go and show yourself to the priest, #go… to the priest. 4:8 The priest was the one who would declare you clean according to the Law when he judged you to be leprous. And offer the sacrifice that was prescribed by Moses, so that people may know that you have been healed.” A Roman officer’s faith.
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and a centurion came to him. #centurion. 5:8 literally “commander of a hundred.” Repeated in verses 8, 13.
He said, “Sir, my master is very ill and bedridden at home. He is completely motionless and suffering from severe pain.”
Jesus said to him, “I am going to heal him.”
The officer replied: “Sir, I do not deserve to enter your house; you just need to say a word and my servant will be healed.”
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to one soldier: “Go!” and he goes. I say to another: “Come!” and he comes. I say to my servant: “Do this!” and he does it.
And when Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to those who followed him, “Truly I say to you, I have not found such faith even among the sons of Israel.”
I tell you that many will come from the East and the West, and they will take your places at the feast with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
Those who were meant to inherit the kingdom will be cast into darkness in the outer realms. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth!
Then Jesus said to the officer, “Go, and let there be healing in all that you believe in.” And at that very moment, the servant of that officer was healed. “Take our diseases.”
When Jesus came to Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s wife lying down on a bed, with a very high fever.
When Jesus touched her hand, her fever left her, and she rose up and began to serve him.
That evening, many people afflicted with evil spirits came to him, and he cast them out by the command of his mouth, and healed all the sick.
This happened to be done to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah: “He took upon himself our infirmities, and bore our diseases.” Following Jesus.
And when Jesus saw a great crowd around Him, He told them to go to the other side of the lake.
Then one of the Islamic scholars approached him and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
Jesus said to him, “It is the foxes’ dens and the birds’ nests that I give to my disciples. But what is the Son of Man to do?”
Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, please let me wait until I bury my father.”
But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” Jesus stills the storm
And Jesus went into a boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a violent storm raged in the lake, so that the boat was covered by the waves. As for Jesus, he was sleeping.
They approached him and woke him up and said, “O chief, save us, for we are drowning.”
Jesus said to them, “Why are you afraid, you have little faith?” Then he got into the boat and faced the storm and the waves, and it became completely calm.
But they were astonished and said to one another, “What is this man who even the winds and the sea obey him?” Jesus was leaving the synagogue and, as he passed by, a man with an unclean spirit came out of many and was convulsing.
Then Jesus came to the region of the Gadarenes, opposite the Galilee shore, and he saw a man clothed with gravements, tormented by demons. And that man was dwelling in the tombs, and no one had been able to subdue him anymore.
The evil spirits screamed: “What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”
And there was a large herd of pigs grazing at a distance from them.
The evil spirits lamented to him and said, “If you expel us, we will go to the swineherd’s flock.”
Jesus said, “Go forth.” Then the evil spirits left the two men, and entered into the pigs. Then all the livestock, the whole flock, rushed from the upper edge of the mountain to the lake, and the pigs plunged into the water.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to the inhabitants, afflicted by evil spirits.
All the people in the town went out to see Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their area.
Jesus heals a paralytic
Jesus got into a boat to cross to the other side of the lake, and he arrived at his town.
So he brought some people who were paralyzed to him, lying on beds. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, my son, your sins are forgiven.”
And some of my religious teachers said: "This man is insulting God with his words."
And Jesus knew what was in their hearts, and said to them, “Why do you think evil thoughts in your hearts?”
Which is easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say ‘Rise up and walk’?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” And he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, take your bed and go home!”
He rose and went to his house.
And when the people saw this, they were filled with awe, and they glorified God because He gave such power to humankind. When will Jesus follow?
While Jesus was going along, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at a tax collector’s place. Then Jesus said to him, “Follow Me!” So the man picked up his cloak and followed Him.
While he was eating at the house of Matthew, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
And when the Pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
Then when Jesus heard it, he said, “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are sick.”
Go and understand what the book means when it says: ‘I want mercy for people, not sacrifices [animal] offerings.’ #I want … animal offerings. 13:9 From the book of Hosea 6: 6. I did not come to call righteous people, but I came to call sinners.’ Question about fasting
Then approached to them disciples of John, and asked him, “Why do we fast much, and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Where are the wedding guests and the bridegroom? For you have been saying, ‘A servant must not marry his mistress,’ but of course, when the bridegroom arrives, he will take his bride away, and then they will feast.”
No one patches an old garment with a new piece of cloth, because the new cloth will shrink and tear the ancient garment, making the hole worse.
People do not put new wine in old leather jars, otherwise the jars will burst and the wine will be spilled, and the leather will be ruined. Therefore, new wine is put in new leather jars, so that the wine and the jars are both preserved. Jesus raises a dead girl // and heals a bleeding woman.
While Jesus was speaking, a leader of the synagogue came up and bowed down before him, and said, “My daughter is dead; but come and put your hand on her, and she will live.”
Jesus rose up and went away with the head of the synagogue, and his disciples followed him.
And there was a woman who had suffered from a severe hemorrhage for twelve years. So she came behind Jesus and touched the hem of his garment.
She said to herself: “If I but touch his cloak, I shall be healed.”
Jesus turned back and said to her, “Be encouraged, my daughter, your faith has healed you.” And at that moment the woman was completely healed.
When Jesus arrived at the head of the synagogue’s house, he saw those playing funeral dirges, and the people were in disorder.
He said, “Get out, get out! The boys aren't dead, but they're sleeping.” They laughed at him.
And when the people had gone out from the house, Jesus entered into the chamber of the maiden and took her by the hand, and she arose.
The news about Jesus spread throughout that entire region. Jesus was healing the blind // and casting out evil spirits.
After Jesus had parted company with them, two blind men came following him, and they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us!”
And when Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I can heal you?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
Then he touched their eyes and said, “Be for you as you have believed.”
The blind men regained their sight. Then Jesus warned them strongly and said, “Do not let anyone know anything about what happened to you.”
But they went and spread the news throughout that entire region.
While they were going, some people brought to Jesus a man who was mute, for he was possessed by demons.
Then Jesus cast out the evil spirit, and the mute man began to speak. The people were astonished and said, “Never have they heard such things in Israel.”
But the Pharisees began to say, “He casts out demons by the power of Baalzebul, #Baalzebul. 34:9 One of his names. The chief of those demons.” The harvest is great
And Jesus was going through the towns and cities, teaching in synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. And he was healing all who were sick.
When Jesus saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, for they were troubled and without a guide, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.”
Let the reapers separate that the harvest may be doubled in the field.
Jesus sends his disciples
And Jesus gave his twelve disciples farewell, and gave them authority over demons, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter; his brother Andrew; James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Phillips and Berthold, Thomas and Matthew, compiler of taxes, Jacob ben Halfa and Tadous,
Simon, also known as “The Zealot,” #TheZealot. 4:10 A member of a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, known as the “Zealots.” And Judas the Galilean, who betrayed Jesus.
And Jesus sent these twelve and gave them the following instructions: “Do not go into a Gentile region, and do not enter a Samaritan city,”
Go, and let the sheep of Israel be sought after.
And they announced that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, heal leprosy, cast out demons. You have taken the kingdom for doing these things freely, so give freely also.
Do not carry gold or silver or copper in your purses.
Do not carry an extra bag or an extra garment or an extra shoe or a cane. The worker deserves his food.
And when you enter any town or village, search if there is someone in it who is hospitable, and stay in that house until you depart.
And when you enter a house, greet its inhabitants.
If the Ahl al-Bayt are deserving, then your peace will come upon them. And if they are not deserving, then your peace will return to you.
If someone does not welcome you in a house or a city, and does not listen to your message, then leave that house or that city, and shake off the dust that has clung to your feet.
I tell you the truth, on the day of judgment, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah will have a condition more likely than that of that city. Jesus warns of tribulations.
Here I send you, like sheep among wolves. Be wise like serpents, and innocent like doves.
Beware of people, for they will hand you over to their courts and whip you in public places.
They will hand you over to governors and kings, because you are my disciples. This will be your opportunity to testify against me before the Jews and non-Jews.
When they seize you, do not worry about what you will say; for at that hour you shall give the right word.
Remember that you are not those who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father will speak in you.
The brother will deliver his brother to be killed, and the father will deliver his son. The sons will turn against their parents and kill them.
And all people will hate you because of my name, but he who remains faithful to the end will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going to all the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes again.
There is no better student than his teacher, nor a servant greater than his master.
The student should suffice by becoming like his teacher, and the slave should suffice by becoming like his master. For if they call the head of the house “Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 25:10 From the names of Satan. A reference to Matthew 9: 34.” what will they call the rest of the household? Fear God, not men.
Do not fear them, for nothing hidden will remain hidden, and nothing concealed will remain concealed.
And whatever I say to you in the darkness, say it in the light; and whatever you whisper in the ears, proclaim it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body, but they cannot kill the soul; fear rather him who can kill the body and soul in Hell.
Wouldn’t two sparrows be sold for one dinar? Yet, not one of them falls to the ground except by my father’s permission.
You are counting every single strand of hair on your heads.
If you are not afraid, you are worth more than many birds. Declare your confession of Christ before men.
Anyone who confesses me before others, I will confess to my Father who is in heaven.
And whoever denies me before people, I will deny him before my Father in heaven. First the Christ.
Do not think that I have come to establish peace on earth. I have not come to give peace, but a sword!
I came: ‹A man divides himself with his father, and a daughter divides herself with her mother, and a niece divides herself with her aunt.
A man’s enemies are his family!
Because he who loves his father and mother more than me is not worthy to be counted among my companions. He who loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy to be counted among my companions.
And he that will not take his cross and follow me, he is not worthy of me.
Anyone who tries to win their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will gain it.
Whoever welcomes you, welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me.
He who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward. He who welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous, will receive a righteous person’s reward.
And who, if he gives even a cup of cold water to one of my humble disciples, for he is a disciple, will surely say, “I will not be deprived of my reward”?
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished teaching the twelve disciples, he departed from that place and went to teach and to preach his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard all that Jesus was doing, so he sent a message with some of his disciples
And I will ask him: “Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for someone else?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “Go and tell John those things which you have heard and seen.”
Here are the blind seeing, the sitting walking, the lepers cleansed, the deaf hearing, the dead living, and the poor hearing the good news.
Congratulations to those who do not hesitate to believe in me.
And as the disciples of John departed, Jesus began to speak to the people about John, saying, “What went you out into the wilderness to see? A fortress that is tossed by the wind?”
Why did you go out if not to see a man wearing fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes live in the palaces of kings.
And why did you leave then? To see a prophet? He is. But I say to you, you have seen someone greater than a prophet!
This is what he wrote about: ‹Here I send my messenger before you. To clear the way for you.›”
I say to you the truth, none of those who were born of the women were greater than John the Baptist; but the least of those in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
And from the time of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom has been subjected to fierce assaults, and the adversaries are trying to seize it by force.
For Moses’ law and all the prophets foretold until John’s time.
If you wish to accept what the prophets and the law say, then John is Elijah who was prophesied about by them regarding his coming. #Elijah… his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of the prophets of God, approximately 850 BC. The Jews were expecting his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Whoever has two ears, let him listen.
What are these generations like? They are like children sitting in markets, calling their friends and saying:
We tormented you, and you didn't dance. We sang you funeral songs, and you didn't weep!
John came, who did not eat as the others did, and did not drink wine as the others did, and people said of him, “He has the spirit of an evil man.”
Then came the Son of Man, who ate and drank the same as others, and the people said, “Look, this is the Son of Man, greedy and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!” But the fruit of wisdom is to prove it is wise. Jesus warns the cities that are to be destroyed.
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles were done, because their people repented not.
He said, “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in them—in Tabitha and you—had happened in you, you would have repented long ago, and the people of your towns would have put on sackcloth and ashes, and sat down with you in mourning.”
But I tell you that the condition of the people of Sur and Saida will be easier than yours on the Day of Judgment.
And you, O Kafarnahum, do you delude yourself that you will be raised to the heavens? No, but you will descend to the abyss! If the miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Sodom, you would still be here to this day.
But I say to you that the condition of the people of Sodom will be more probable than the condition of your people on the day of judgment. Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus said, “Thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent, but you have revealed them to simple ones like children.”
Yes, Father, because you enjoyed doing this.
“The Father has given everything to me. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son. And whoever the Son wills, he makes know of him.”
Come to me, you weary ones, and you who bear heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.
Carry Niri #Niri. 29:11 Niri is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a symbol of Jewish law. Be upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, so that you may find peace for your souls.
“Because the burden I give you is light, and the load I put upon you is easy.”
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went to walk in the fields on the Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Your disciples do what is not permitted on the Sabbath.”
Jesus said to them, “Did you not read in the Scriptures that when David was a fasting man, he did fast for days?”
He entered the house of God and ate from the loaves of bread presented to God, although it is not permitted for him or those with him to eat that bread, but only the priests are allowed to do so.
Haven't you also read in Moses' law how the priests on Saturday do not observe the law concerning the Sabbath? And yet, they are not held accountable for this work.
But I tell you there is something greater than the structure here.
If you know what it means when the Book says, “I want mercy for people, not sacrifices.” #I want… animal sacrifices. 7:12 From the book of Hosea 6: 6. When you judge those innocent people.
“For every son of man is the Lord of the Sabbath.” Healing on the Sabbath.
Then he left that place and went to their compound.
And there was a man whose hand was paralyzed. The people asked Jesus, “Does this Sabbath permit the healing of this man’s hand?” They asked him that, in order to have an accusation against Him.
He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath day, would you not seize it and take it out?”
Humans are more important than sheep. If you do good deeds on Saturday, you are in accordance with the Sharia law.
Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, made whole, just like the other.
The Pharisees went out and began to conspire to find out how they could kill Jesus. Jesus: Servant of God Chosen.
And Jesus knew their plan, and He left that place. Then a large crowd followed Him, and He explained everything to them.
And they were commanded not to reveal who he was.
This happened to fulfill what was said by God through the prophet Isaiah:
Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom I am well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare justice to the nations.
He will not quarrel with anyone and will not shout, and no one will hear his voice in their streets.
Not even the bent reed will break it, nor will it extinguish even the smoldering ember. And it will continue until justice prevails.
“And all nations shall put their trust in him.” Sultan of Jesus
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and mute, for he was possessed by an evil spirit, and they cast him out, and he spoke and saw.
People were astonished and said, "Could this man be David's son?"
And when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebub. #Beelzebub. 24:12 One of the names of Satan. Also in chapter 27. The chief of the demons.”
And when Jesus knew their thoughts, He said to them, “Truly, I say to you, if a kingdom or city is divided against itself, it will fall. And if a house is divided against itself, it will not stand.”
If the devil drives out spirits and fights himself, how can his kingdom stand?
If I expel evil spirits with the power of Baalzebul, what do your disciples expel them with? They are those who judge you.
But if I cast out evil spirits by the Spirit of God, then your kingdom has come to you.
How can anyone enter the house of a powerful man and plunder his possessions, unless the powerful man has first tied him up? Then he becomes able to plunder his house.
Whoever is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I say to you: every trespass and offense that is forgiven people, but offense against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come. The fruit shows the truth.
In order to obtain good fruit, plant a good tree. As for the bad tree, it will give you bad fruit. For the tree knows its fruit.
You snakes, how can you speak of good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks what the heart contains.
A righteous person brings forth from their inner treasure what is good, and a wicked person brings forth from their stored evil what is evil.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment, people will be asked about every word they spoke.
“And your words will determine your innocence or guilt.” Jewish leaders demand evidence.
Then some of the Torah teachers and Pharisees asked him and said, “Rabbi, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.”
He replied to them: “This wicked and corrupt generation seeks a proof in order to believe. And it will not be given except the proof of the prophet Jonah.”
Just as Jonah remained in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so too will the Son of Man remain in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will stand against this generation on the day of judgment, and they will condemn them for having repented when they heard the warning of Jonah. And now, here before you is one greater than Jonah.
And Queen of the South will stand #Queen of the South. 42:12 Queen of Sheba. And she traveled approximately two thousand kilometers to hear the wisdom of God on the mouth of King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10: 1-13. The day of judgment against this generation and it will condemn it. For she has come from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now here before you is he who is greater than Solomon. An empty soul.
When a foul spirit departs from a person, it goes through dry and desolate places, seeking a place to settle, but finds none.
Then he says, “I will return to my home from which I came.” And he goes and finds the house empty, swept, and tidy.
Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits that are worse than he, who enter and dwell there. And so the condition of that man’s last state is worse than his first state. Thus it will happen with this present generation of evil people. Jesus’ disciples are his family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking him to speak to them.
One of the people said to Jesus, “Your mother and brothers are waiting outside and want to speak to you.”
Jesus replied, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
Then he gestured with his hand towards his disciples and said, “These are my mother and my brothers.”
“For whoever obeys my word is without God. Whoever listens to me is the brother and sister of God, and the mother and the child.”
Like a sower
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lake shore.
A large crowd gathered around him. He climbed into a boat and sat in it, while people stood on the shore.
He told them many things in parables. He said to them, “Go, the farmer should sow.”
While he was sowing, some of the seeds fell by the roadside, and birds came and ate them.
Some seeds germinated on a rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and because it had no roots, it withered.
Some seeds germinated among the thorns. The thorns grew and hindered their growth.
Other seeds fell on good soil, and some of them yielded a hundredfold, and some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
“Whoever has two ears, let him listen.” Hearing and understanding.
And the disciples came to him and asked him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
Jesus replied, “God has given you a privilege, the knowledge of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but he did not give it to them.”
For whoever has, and owns, #who owns. 12:13 Perhaps “who owns” means “who understands.” It will be increased to him, and overflow from him, but to him who does not have, that which he has will be taken from him.
That’s why I speak to them with parables, even though they see, yet they do not understand. And even though they hear, yet they do not comprehend.
And this applies to them the prophecy of Isaiah: “You will hear and not understand, and see and not perceive.”
The minds of this people have become dull, and their ears heavy. Close their eyes, lest they be unable to observe with their eyes, or hear with their ears, or understand with their hearts, so that they do not return to me seeking healing.
As for you, congratulations to your eyes, for they see, and to your ears, for they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous people longed to see what you see and did not see, and desired to hear what you hear and did not hear. Like the seed
“Listen to an explanation like that of a seed:”
When a person hears a message from the Kingdom and does not understand it, the Evil One #EvilOne comes. 19:13 That is, Satan. (Also in verse 38) And he takes the seeds that were sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
Those who fell upon the rocky ground resembled those who hear the word and accept it immediately with joy.
But because he has no roots in himself, he stands for a short time, and when distress and persecution come because of the word that preceded him, he loses his faith quickly.
“As for the one who fell among the thorns, she is like someone who hears the word, but the worries of life, and the temptation of money, choke the word, so that it does not bear fruit.”
Whoever plants a seed of goodness, he who hears the Word and understands it, and acts upon it, will reap a hundredfold, and sixtyfold, and thirtyfold. Like corn and weeds.
And another said to them, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seeds in his field.”
But while the people were sleeping, an enemy of man came and sowed harmful herbs among the wheat, then departed.
When we sprout wheat and the shape of the ears, weeds also sprout.
His servants came to him and said, “Master, did you not plant good seeds in your field? Where did these weeds come from?”
The man replied to them, “My enemy did that.” Then his servants asked him, “Do you want us to go and uproot her?”
“And the man replied, ‘No, because when you pull up the weeds, you may pull up the wheat with them.’”
Invite them to grow together until the harvest time, then I will say to the harvesters: ‹First gather the weeds and pack them in bundles for fire. As for the wheat, gather it and put it in my storehouse.› For example, mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus said to them, “For example, the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.”
It is the smallest of the seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plants in the orchards, becoming a large tree, even birds of the sky come to it and build their nests in its branches.
And another said to them, “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast taken and mixed into three measures of flour until it is all leavened.”
Jesus said all these things using parables. And he did not speak to people except in parables.
And this is what God said through the Prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables, and speak of hidden things since the world was made.”
Then Jesus withdrew the crowds and entered into the house. Then His disciples came unto Him, and said, “Explain to us the parable of the tares among the wheat.”
He said to them, “The Son of Man is the one who plants the good seeds.”
The field is the world, and the good seeds are those who possess the kingdom. As for the weeds, they belong to the evil.
The enemy who sowed them was Satan. The harvest is the end of the world. And the harvesters are the angels.
Just as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will be the end of the world.
As the Son of Man will send out his angels to gather all the evildoers and wicked ones from His kingdom,
Then they throw them into the burning oven. There, people weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the just will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let those who have ears, hear. For example, the treasure and the pearl.
Heaven’s kingdom is like a treasure buried in a field. A man found it and buried it again. Overwhelmed with joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
And the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls.
When he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a net for catching fish.
It resembles the kingdom of the heavens as a net cast into the lake, and I seized fish of various kinds.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and began to choose the good fish, putting them in baskets, while discarding the bad ones.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, as the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then the villains hurled themselves into the burning oven. There, people wept and gnashed their teeth.
And Jesus asked his disciples, “Do you all understand all these things?” They replied, “Yes.”
He said to them, “Therefore, every teacher of the law who masters the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who takes out of his store new jars, and old jars.” Jesus goes to his own city.
And when Jesus had finished telling those parables, he left that place.
And when he went to his town, he began to teach them in their meeting place. Then everyone was astonished and said, “From where did this man come, with such wisdom and such miracles?”
Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother Mary? Aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Don’t you all judge all his sisters among us? Where did he get all this?”
That was an obstacle preventing them from accepting it. As for Jesus, he said to them, “No prophet arises in the presence of his own people without being believed in them!”
Miracles didn't work many there, because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time, Herod the Tetrarch of Galilee heard #the Tetrarch of Galilee. 1:14 Literally, “quarter governor.” The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, so the governor of each province was called the quarter governor or the tetrarch. See Luke 3:1. About Jesus.
He said to his servant: “It is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead, and for this reason miracles are performed in his name!” The murder of John the Baptist
Herodes had John arrested and put him in prison, because Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, desired him.
John said to Herod, “You are not allowed to take your brother’s wife.”
That’s why Herod wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when the day of Herod’s birthday came, Herodias’ daughter danced before him and before his guests, and Herod was very pleased.
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
But her mother had taught her what to ask, and she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist on a plate.”
The king hesitated, but he ordered that her request be fulfilled due to his oath and out of respect for his guests.
So he sent to cut off the head of John in prison.
Then I brought his head on a plate and gave it to her mother.
Then John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus fed more than five thousand.
When Jesus heard this, he got into a boat and went to a deserted place. And the crowds, knowing this, followed him from the towns.
As he descended to the beach, he saw a large gathering, so he sympathized with them and healed the sick among them.
As evening fell, his disciples came to him and said, “This place is isolated and the time is very late. Send people to the villages to buy food for them.”
But Jesus said to them, “Do not send them away yet, for your sake. Feed them there.”
His disciples said to him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”
Jesus said to them, “Bring her to me.”
And he commanded the people to sit on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and he gave thanks to God, lifting up his eyes to heaven. Then he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people.
They all ate and became full. And they raised the remaining food, so there were twelve full baskets of fragments.
And there were five thousand men who ate, not counting the women and the children. Jesus walked on the water.
Then Jesus asked his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.
After dismissing them, he climbed the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was alone.
The boat had now reached the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing against it violently, because the wind was against its direction.
And shortly before dawn, Jesus came walking toward them across the lake.
And when his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were filled with fear and terror, and said, “It is a ghost!” And their fear caused them to cry out.
And Jesus immediately said to them, “Be encouraged, I am here, do not be afraid.”
And Peter replied, “Lord, if this is truly you, then let me come to you walking on water.”
He said to him, “Come.” Then Peter got out of the boat and began to walk toward Jesus on the water.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and began to drown, and cried out, “Lord, save me.”
Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and took him, and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And when Jesus and Peter climbed into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat knelt before Jesus and said, “You are the Son of God truly.” Jesus healed many.
And when they crossed the lake, they reached the area of Jenin.
And when the inhabitants of that region came to know Jesus, they announced his coming throughout the surrounding area, bringing to him all who were sick.
And pray to Him that they may touch the fringe of His garment. And all who touched it were made well.
God’s law and people’s traditions
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Him from Jerusalem, and said
Why are your students breaking the traditions we learned from our ancestors? They don't even wash their hands before eating.
And Jesus answered them, “Why do you break God’s commandment for the sake of your traditions?”
And God commanded and said, “Honor your father and mother.” #Honor… your mother. 4:15 From Exodus 20: 12, and Deuteronomy 5: 16. And He said, “Whoever reviles his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.” #Whoever reviles… shall be put to death. 4:15 From Exodus 21: 17.
But you say: ‘Who told his father or his mother, “I cannot help you,” because everything I have given to the Lord, and he is not obligated to honor his father or mother?’
And thereby you rejected God’s commandment because of your traditions.
You hypocrites, may Isaiah be proven right when he prophesied about you said:
This people praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship is useless, because they know teachings that are nothing more than human precepts.
And Jesus said to the people, “Listen to me and understand what I say:”
It is not what enters a person’s mouth that makes it impure, but what comes out of it; that is what makes it impure.
Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees are angry because you did not eat with the tax collectors?”
And Jesus answered and said to them, “Every plant of the field that My Father has not allowed will be pulled up by the roots.”
Leave them alone, they are blind men leading blind men. And if another blind man leads a blind man, then both of them will fall into the pit.
And Peter replied: "Explain to us the meaning of this analogy."
Then Jesus said, “Do you still not understand?”
Don't you understand that everything that enters a human mouth goes into the stomach, and then comes out?
But what comes out of a person’s mouth comes from the heart. And this is what defiles a person.
For from the heart come wickedness and murder and immorality and adultery and theft and false witness and slander.
These are the things that defile a person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not make a person unclean. Jesus helps a stranger.
And Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a woman came to him, a Canaanite woman who lived in that region, and began to cry out, “Lord, please, son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon.”
Jesus did not say a word about her. Then his disciples came to him and said to him, “Expel her from here, for she follows us and is disturbing us.”
He said, “I only sent it to the lost sheep of Israel.”
But the woman approached him and prostrated herself before him and said, “O my Lord, help me.”
And Jesus answered and said unto her, “It is not good to take the food of the children and give it to the dogs.”
She said, “It’s true, Mr., but even dogs eat what falls from their owners’ tables.”
Then Jesus replied to her, “Woman, your faith is very great. Indeed, what you ask for will be done for you.” And immediately, her daughter was healed. Jesus heals many.
And Jesus left that place and went to a region near the Sea of Galilee. And he climbed a hill and sat down there.
Large crowds came to him, and with them were cripples, the blind, lame, and many who were sick, and he healed them.
Crowds were astonished when they saw the deaf and mute speaking, cripples being healed, lame people walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised God, the God of Israel. Jesus fed more than four thousand.
Jesus called to him the disciples and said, “I have compassion for these people, for they have been with me now three days, and nothing to eat. I do not want them to faint on their way, lest we fall under the way.”
His disciples said to Him, “Where can we get enough bread for these people to eat, in such a deserted place?”
Jesus said to them, “How much do you have? They said to him, ‘Seven loaves and a few small fish.’”
Jesus told the people to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and thanked, and divided the loaves among the disciples, giving them to the disciples to distribute to all.
Everyone ate and became full. Then they gathered what was left of the breakage, and there were seven baskets full.
There were four thousand men eating, excluding women and children.
When Jesus dismissed the crowds, he climbed into a boat and went to the region of the Gadarenes.
Jewish leaders test Jesus
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from God.
Jesus replied, “When the sun is setting, you say, ‘It will be fine weather, because the sky is red.’
And in the early morning, you say: ‘Today will be stormy, because the sky is red and threatening.’ You are good at interpreting the signs of the climate, but you are not good at understanding the times in which you live!
This wicked, corrupt generation seeks proof in order to believe. And it will only be given proof of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and withdrew from them. Lack of understanding.
And the disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
And Jesus said to them, “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Then the students began to talk and say among themselves: “But we didn’t bring bread!”
And Jesus knew what they were saying, and He said to them, “You little faith, why do you argue among yourselves about not having bread?”
Haven’t you realized yet? Don’t you remember the five loaves for five thousand, and how many baskets did you gather from the leftover fragments?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets did you gather from the remainder?
Why don't you understand that I wasn't speaking to you about ordinary bread, but warning you to save yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
Then his disciples understood that he had not intended to warn them about the yeast of the bread, but about the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Christ
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, His disciples asked Him, “Who is the Son of Man that people are saying He is?”
And his disciples answered him, “Some say that you are John the Baptist, and others say that you are Elijah, and others say that you are Jeremiah, or like one of the other prophets.”
He said to them: “And you, what do you think I am?”
Simon Peter replied and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of God.”
Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simeon, because of your steadfastness and your expectation of the salvation of Israel. For it is by no human reason or foresight that this has happened to you, but by the will of my Father, God.”
And I say to you, you are Peter, #بطرس. 18:16 From the Greek “Petros” and its meaning is “rock.” And upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell #أبواب الهاوية. 18:16 that is, the power of death. You will not be able to overcome it.
And I will give you the keys to the kingdom of the heavens, for whatever you bind on earth, God will bind in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth, God will loose in heaven.
Then He strongly warned His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ. Jesus was speaking about the certainty of His death.
From that time forward, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to the city of Jerusalem, and that he would suffer many things at the hands of the elders and the chief priests and the teachers of the law. And that he must be killed, and on the third day, he will be raised.
But Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “No, Lord! It shall not be done to you!”
Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are setting me on a collision course with the interests of God, not human concerns.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wishes to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.”
He who wants to save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for me will find it.
What benefit does a person gain if he wins the whole world and loses himself? And what is it that a person can do to regain his life?
For as the Son of man cometh in the glory of his Father with the angels of his glory, and shall give to every one according to his works.
I tell you the truth, among those standing here are people who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in the kingdom of God.
Jesus and with him Moses and Elijah
Six days later, Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain to be alone.
While they were still looking at him, Jesus changed and began to shine like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and they were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, how lovely it is to be here! If you will, I shall erect three tabernacles here – one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While Peter was speaking, a shining cloud remained over them, and from it came a voice saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight. Listen to him.”
And when the students heard that, they were terrified and fell to the ground face down.
Jesus approached and touched them, saying, “Rise, do not be afraid.”
And when they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus.
And while they were descending from the mountain, Jesus said to them, “Do not tell anyone until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”
And he would ask his students: “Why do teachers of the Law say that Elijah should come first?” #Elijah … first. 10:17 Elijah was one of the prophets of God, around 850 BC. The Jews were expecting his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
And Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless I do the Father’s work, I will not do anything.
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and the people did not recognize him, but treated him according to their desires. And the Son of Man will also receive such treatment from them.”
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus is casting out a demon from a boy.
And when they came back to the gathering, a man came to Jesus and knelt before him.
He said, “Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he suffers from epilepsy and is in great pain. He often falls into fire or water.”
“And I brought him to your disciples, but they were not able to heal him.”
Then Jesus said, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, until when shall I be with you, until when shall I endure you?” Then he said to the man, “Bring the boy here.”
Jesus commanded the evil spirit to leave the boy, and immediately the boy was healed.
Then He came to them alone His disciples and asked Him, “Why were we not able to cast out this demon?”
And Jesus answered them, “Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if your faith was the size of a mustard seed, it could move mountains; ‘for truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you will do things to this mountain that people say are impossible.”
But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting. Jesus announces the approach of his death.
While they were traveling together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “Behold, the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.”
They will kill him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead. And the disciples were very sad. The tax of the Temple.
And when Jesus came to Capernaum, he came to Peter, who was keeping the public weig house, and they asked him, “Does not the teacher of our tax collect pay the two-drachma tax?”
Then Peter replied, “Yes, it shall be done.” Then Peter went away to the house. And Jesus hastened to speak to him and said, “Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings’ tribute and taxes come? From their own people, or from other nations?”
Peter replied, “They gather it from other nations.” Jesus said, “If so, let the sons of the house be excused from it.”
But to avoid causing them trouble, go to the lake and cast your fishing rod. Then take the first fish you catch and open its mouth. You will find a coin inside worth four dirhams. Take it and give it to them through me and you.
