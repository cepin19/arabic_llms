The Greatest in the Kingdom of the Heavens
At that hour, the students approached Jesus and said, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
And Jesus called the boy to him and restored him to his mother.
He said, “Truly I tell you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”
He who makes himself like this young man is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And by a son like this, named as he is, I have been accepted.
And whoever finds fault with one of these humble believers, for me, is better that a stone of mercury be placed around his neck and he drown in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world with its stumbles! For stumbles will surely come, but woe to the human being upon whom they fall!
If your hand or your foot touches the edge, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter this world maimed or cut off than to enter the eternal fire with your hands or feet intact.
And if your eye weeps, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life with an injured eye than to enter the hellfire with both eyes. Like a stray sheep.
Behold, do not despise the least of these. For I say to you, their angels in heaven are always watching the face of my Father in heaven.
For man has come that he may redeem that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them is lost, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go after the one that is lost?
And it happened that he found him, so I say to you: he rejoices in him more than ninety-nine that have strayed.
Thus it is not my will that any of these little ones perish before your Father in heaven. If your brother sins against you, do not bring him to the elders, lest you testify against him.
And if your brother commits a mistake against you, go to him and rebuke him privately, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, then you have won your brother.
And if it is not heard, then take with you also one or two, that two witnesses may testify to a word.
And if they do not hear from them, say to the church. And if they do not hear from the church, be with the poor and the needy.
I tell you, all that you bind on earth, is bound in heaven; and all that you loose on earth, is loosed in heaven.
And I also say to you: If two of you agree on an affair on earth, then it is for them from their Lord, who has dominion over all things.
Because wherever two or three are gathered in My name, there I am with them. Like the slave who obeys.
And Jesus said to them, “I do not forgive sins, except for those who repent.” And Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, if I have done sin, how often should I forgive my brother, and when?” He said to him, “Turn the other to him who sins against you, and do not let yourself be kept for the number of his sins.”
Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, seven times, but seven times seven times.”
Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is like a king who wanted to reckon his servants.
And when he began to reckon, a man came to him, burdened with a debt of two thousand six hundred [weight] of wheat.
And when his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all that was his to be sold, and he could not fulfill his master’s command.
The slave’s pride and he prostrated himself before him, saying: “O my Lord, restrain yourself concerning me, for I fulfill all your desires.”
He freed that slave and set him free, and left him with his religion.
And when that slave went out, he found one of the slaves among his companions, who was indebted to him a hundred dinars; so he seized him and took his neck, saying: Pay me what you owe me.
The slave’s pride was his companion at his feet, and he asked him saying: “Be cautious of yourself, I will fulfill all your needs.”
He did not respond, and proceeded to throw him into prison until he fulfilled his duty.
And when the slaves saw their companions as they were, they were very saddened. And they came and told their master everything that had happened.
Then his master called him and said to him, “O evil slave, all that religion which you abandoned for me, because you asked of it.”
But was it not you who should also have shown compassion to your fellow servant as you showed compassion to me?
And he entrusted his master to tormentors until he had fulfilled what was due to him.
Thus does your heavenly father act toward you, if you do not remove from your hearts each one his brother’s grievance.
Marriage and Divorce
And when Jesus had finished saying these things, he departed from Galilee and went across the Jordan, and came into the borders of Judea.
And he followed them with a great multitude there.
And the Pharisees came to test him, saying unto him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
And he answered them, saying, “Have you not read that he who created them from [the] beginning made them male and female?”
He said: For this reason, a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them will be one flesh.
If they are not two, but one body, then let no one separate them, for God has joined them.
They said to him: “Why did Moses decree that if a divorce document is given, it should be annulled?”
He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart, I permit you to divorce your wives. But it was not so ordained.”
And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife except for [the reason of] adultery, and marries another, he commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman committing adultery, he also commits adultery.”
His students said to him, “If this is the way the man relates to the woman, then do not agree that he should marry!”
He said to them: “Not all accept this word, but those to whom I have given it,”
Because there were two boys born like this from the bellies of their mothers, and two boys whom people have known, and two boys who have made themselves known for the kingdom of heaven. Whoever is able, let him accept. Jesus blesses the children.
Then they brought to him children, so that he might lay his hands on them and bless them. The disciples rebuked them.
And Jesus said, “Let the children come to me and do not hinder them, for such is the kingdom of heaven.”
He placed his hands on them and walked away. The rich young man
And if one person were to come forward and say to him, “O righteous teacher, what righteous deed shall I do to attain eternal life?”
He said to him, “Why do you invite me, a righteous one? None is righteous except Allah. But if you wish to enter the Life, keep the commandments.”
He said to him, “Which is the greatest commandment?” Jesus answered, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.”
Honour your father and your mother, and love your neighbour as yourself.
The young man said to him, “I’ve memorized all of these since my youth. What do I lack now?”
Jesus said to him, “If you want to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor. Then you will have a treasure in heaven, and come follow me.”
And when the young man heard the word, he went away sorrowful, for he had much wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you, it is impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!”
And I also say to you: It is easier for a needle to pass through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!
And when his disciples heard it, they were very amazed, saying, “Who then can be saved?”
And he looked at them and said to them, “With men it is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”
Then Peter answered him and said, “Master, we have left everything and followed you. What shall we then have?”
Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, you are those who have followed me in the renewal. When the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory, then you too will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”
Whoever leaves a house or relatives or kinship ties or a father or mother or a wife or children for the sake of My name, shall receive a hundredfold in return and inherit eternal life.
But many firsts are later, and many later are firsts.
Like the deed in generosity
Indeed, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a homeowner who went out at dawn to hire a worker for his generosity.
I have agreed with the dealer on a dinar today, and sent them to his vineyard.
Then he went towards three o'clock and saw others standing in the market, unemployed.
He said to them: “Go yourselves to Jericho, and give to those who ask and those who refuse. Then you will see.” So they went away.
He also went around six and nine o'clock and did so.
Then, around eleven o'clock, he went out and found others standing idle, and he said to them: “Why did you stand here all day idle?”
They said to him: Because no one has hired us. He said to them: You go yourselves to the wealthy man and take what is due to you.
And when evening came, the generous man said to his agent: “Dismiss the work and give them the wages, starting from the last ones to the first.”
The men of the eleven o'clock clock suddenly appeared and took a denarius here and a denarius there.
And when those before them came, they thought they were taking more, so they took their share as well, by share.
And as they were taking, they were complaining about the Lord of the House.
They say: These others worked for one hour, and we, who endured the weight of the day and the heat, have leveled them.
He replied and said to one of them: “My friend, you were not wronged! Didn’t we agree on a dinar?”
Take the one that is yours and go, for I wish to give this last one like you.
Or what is it that befalls me to do what I desire, with what I have? Or is your eye evil because I am righteous?
“Thus it is written, ‘The last shall be first and the first shall be last.’” Jesus announces his death and resurrection.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took with him the twelve disciples and entered them into a house.
And there we ascend unto Jerusalem, and the Son of Man is delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes, who then judge him to die.
He will deliver them to be mocked, flogged, and crucified, and on the third day he will rise again. My son, Barabbas, requests his release.
Then his mother, and her two daughters, came to him, and she knelt and asked him for a thing.
He said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “Tell them to sit, these two sons of mine, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom.”
And Jesus answered and said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am going to drink, and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” They said to Him, “We are able.”
He said to them: “As for my cup, you shall drink from it, and as for the dye with which I have dyed myself, you shall dye yourselves with it. And as for sitting to the right and to the left of me, I shall not give it to anyone except those whom I have prepared from my family.”
And when they heard the ten, they were angry about the brothers.
And Jesus said to them, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great men rule over them.”
Do not let it be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you should be a servant of the others.
And whoever desires to be great among you, let him be a servant of all.
“And he came to serve, not to be served, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” – Healing the Blind at Jericho
And as they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed them.
And if a blind man and a lame man were sitting by the road, then when they heard Jesus passing by, they cried out, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”
They silenced the assembly with their rebuke, and they were the ones shouting the loudest: “Have mercy on us, O Lord, O son of David!”
Jesus stood and said to them, “What do you want me to do?”
They said to him, “O master, may our eyes open!”
Jesus opened his eyes and touched them, and immediately he saw and followed him.
Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to the house that was called Cavour, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples
He said to them: “Go to the village that is before you, for you will find there an ant, tied up and a fig with her. Adorn them both and bring them to me.”
And if anyone tells you anything, say: "The Lord is in need of it." So send Him.”
And all of this was so that what was said about the prophet who speaks would be fulfilled:
Tell the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your king comes to you, triumphant, riding on a donkey, young donkey.”
The students went and did as Jesus commanded them.
And they brought the female camel and the donkey, and they covered them with their clothes and sat upon them.
And some gathered and spread their clothes along the way. And others broke branches from the trees and spread them along the way.
And the bands who hastened and those who followed were crying out, saying, “Give us guidance for the son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Give us guidance in the heights!”
And when He entered Jerusalem, the whole city shook, saying, “Who is this?”
The crowd said, “This is Jesus the Nazarene, the prophet, whom you mock.” Cleansing of the Temple
And Jesus entered into the temple and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and he threw over the tables of the money changers and overturned the chairs of the tax collectors.
He said to them, “It is written: My house is the house of prayer, and you have made it a cave for thieves!”
And my uncle and his crippled companion entered the temple, and he healed them.
And when the heads of the priests and scribes saw the marvels which he did, and the children cried out in the temple, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were enraged.
They said to him, “Do you hear what these men are saying?” Jesus replied, “Yes! Have you not read that from the mouths of infants and sucklings you draw out a word of righteousness?”
Then he left them and went out beyond the city to the house of En-Gedi and stayed there. A fig tree was ripening.
And when he was on his way back to the city, he became famished.
She looked at a fig tree by the road, and came to it, but found nothing in it except parchment. She said to it: “Do not bear fruit forever!” The fig tree accepted its fate.
And when the disciples saw this, they were amazed, saying, “How was the wine made to dry up so quickly?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will do great things, but if you say to the mountain, ‘Move aside, and throw yourself down here,’ you will do it.
“And all that you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.” Question about the authority of Jesus.
And when he came to the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people approached him, saying, “By what authority do you do these things? And who has given you power to do them?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “I also ask you one thing: if you say to me, ‘By what power or authority do you do this?’
John’s baptism: Where was it from? From heaven or from men? “And they say unto themselves, ‘If he were from God, we would surely know.’”
And if we say, “We are from among the people,” we fear the mob, lest John be treated like a prophet among you all.
They replied to Jesus and said, “We don’t know.” He also said to them, “Neither do I say to you what authority I have to do this. Like the sonnets
What do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, “My son, go today and work in my vineyard.”
He replied and said: I don't want it. But he regretted it finally and moved on.
And he came to the second and said, “It is the same.” Then he replied, “Here I am, my lord.” And he had not yet departed.
“Which of the two does the will of the Father desire?” They said to him, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes enter the kingdom of heaven ahead of you.”
That Jesus came to you in the way of truth, but you did not believe in him; and as for the tax collectors and the prostitutes, they believed in him. And when you saw it, you did not regret believing, so that you might not have remorse. Like the good Samaritan
Listen, for example, the last one: A man was a homeowner who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, dug a press in it, and built a tower, and entrusted it to trustworthy people and traveled.
And when the fruits were near, He sent His servants to the noble ones to take His fruits.
Then the Crusaders took their slaves and flogged some of them and killed some of them and stoned some of them.
Then He also sent other slaves more than the first. And they acted in the same way towards them.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying: “They fear my son!”
As for the righteous men, when they saw the son, they said among themselves: “This is the heir! Let us kill him and take his inheritance!”
They took him out and led him outside the sanctuary and killed him.
“When did the owner of generosity come, what is he doing with those generous people?”
They said to him, “Those who are arrogant will be destroyed utterly, and grace will be given to others who are worthy, who will receive the fruits of it in due time.”
Jesus said to them, “Have you not read that the stone the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?” No one among the builders valued that stone, but it is the one everyone now considers to be the head of the corner.” The Lord had planned it all along, and it was astonishing to their eyes!
Therefore I say to you: the kingdom of God is departing from you and being given to a nation that yields its fruits.
“And whoever falls on this stone will suckle, and whoever falls upon it will crush him!”
And when the heads of the Pharisees and the scribes heard Him, they knew that He spoke about Him.
And when they sought to seize him, they feared the crowd, for he was like a prophet among them.
Like the wedding of a prince's son
And Jesus also spoke to them in parables, saying:
It resembles the kingdom of the heavens, like a man, a king, who prepared a wedding for his son.
And he sent his servants to invite the invited guests to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
So he sent out other slaves, saying, “Tell the invited guests: Behold, my banquet is ready. My lamb has been prepared, and my drink offering is poured; come to the wedding!”
But they turned a blind eye and went on, one to his field, and another to his trade.
And al-Baqoon seized their slaves and cursed and killed them.
And when the king was enraged, he sent out his soldiers and destroyed those killed fighters and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants: “The wedding is ready, and as for the guests, they were not worthy.”
Go to the crossroads, and invite everyone you find there to the wedding.
And those slaves went out to the streets, and gathered all whom they found wicked and righteous. And the wedding was filled with the adorned.
And when the king entered to see the wedding guests, he saw there a man who was not wearing wedding attire.
He said to him, “My friend, how did you enter here without wedding attire?” He remained silent.
Then the king said to the servants, “Bind his feet and hands, and lead him outside into the darkness and the wilderness. There let him weep and wail with all his heart.”
“Many claim, and few vote.” Pay unto Caesar the due thereof.
Then the Pharisees went and consulted with Jesus, to trap Him in a word.
So they sent to him their disciples with the Herodianites, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and you know the way of God rightly, and you do not care about anyone, for you do not look at the face of men.”
“Tell us: do you think it is permissible to pay tribute to Caesar?”
And Jesus knew their malice and said, “Why do you test me, sons of darkness?”
Show me the *jazia* contract.” So they gave him a dinar.
He asked them, “Who are these pictured and writing?”
They said to him, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
And when they heard it, they were astonished and left him and went away. Asking about the resurrection of the dead.
On that day, Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him
They say: “O Teacher, Moses said: If one dies without children, he marries his brother’s wife and establishes a lineage for his brother.”
We had seven brothers, and the first one married and died. And since he had no offspring, his wife left for her brother.
And the second, the third, to the seventh.
And the woman also died last.
“And in the resurrection, to whom of the seven will the wife belong? For she was for all!”
And Jesus answered them and said, “You are wrong for you do not know the Scripture, nor the power of God.”
Because in the Hereafter they do not marry or are married, but they will be like the angels of God in the heavens.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which is told to you by God, the Creator?
Am I God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? “Lord, You are God of the living, not of the dead.”
And when the people heard of his teaching, they were astonished at his sermon. The great legacy.
And the Pharisees, when they had heard this, made a meeting together.
And one of them, named Nami, asked to try it, saying:
“Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.”
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
“Behold, I say to you, until the whole Law and the Prophets shall be fulfilled, the Messiah and David.”
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
He said, “What do you think of the Messiah? Who is his son?” They said to him, “Son of David.”
He said to them, “How can David call the spirit a sojourner [or foreigner]?” He said,
And the Lord said unto me, “Get aside to the right hand, until I make my enemies your footstool.”
If David calls him usury, how can his son be?
No one was able to answer him. And since that day, no one has dared to ask him a word.
Warning from the Scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples
He said, “The scribes and the Pharisees sat on chairs.”
And whatever they tell you to memorize, memorize it; and do it. But do not act according to their deeds, for they say one thing and do another.
They burden people with heavy, difficult loads, and they don't want to move them with a finger.
And all their work is that people may look at them: they display their swords and magnify the eyelashes of their garments.
And they love the first seat at the gatherings, and the first councils at the assemblies.
And greetings in the markets, and the people calling him: “O my Lord, my Lord!”
And as for you, do not call me your Lord, for I am your teacher, the Messiah, and you are all brothers.
And do not raise up any fathers for yourselves in the earth, for you have one Father in the heavens.
And do not obey men, for you have one teacher and one overseer, the Christ.
And the eldest among you shall be your servant.
He who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted. Woe to those scribes and Pharisees.
But woe to you, you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven before your faces, neither do you let those who are inside enter in.
To the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, I say to you, you devour widows' houses, and for a pretence you make long prayers. Therefore you shall receive greater condemnation.
To the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, I say to you, for you are sailing over sea and land to get one denarius, and when you get it, you raise up a feast to celebrate, and forget that you are one day to be paid tenfold back.
Greetings, blind leaders! The speaker says: He who swears by the pillar of the temple is nothing, but he who swears by the gold of the temple is bound.
You fools and the blind! Which is greater: to destroy or to demolish the structure that sanctifies gold?
And whoever swears by the altar is nothing, but whoever swears by the sacrifice on which he is bound is sincere.
You fools and the blind! Greater is the sacrifice or the altar that consecrates the sacrifice?
So whoever invokes the altar, invokes it and everything upon it!
And whoever swears by the structure (Temple) has sworn by it and by what is within it.
And whoever swears by the sky, has sworn by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
To the scribes and Pharisees who make yourselves venerable, I say, for you tithe of mint and anise and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, namely, justice and mercy and faith. It behooves you to practice these, and not to leave the others.
You blind leaders! Who point out gnats and swallow bulls.
To the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, I say to you, for you string together within your baskets and scrolls, which are from within the possessions stolen by kidnapping and prostitution.
O you blind tax collector! Go first into the Lord’s house, and it will be made clean for you also.
To the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, I say to you, you are like tombs white on the outside, but inside you are filled with the bones of all the dead and every vile thing!
Thus are you also: You appear righteous to the people when you are outside, but within you are burdened with hypocrisy and sin.
To the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites: for you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say: If we were in the days of our fathers, we would not have shared with them the blood of the prophets.
You bear witness to yourselves that you are the sons of the killers of the prophets.
Fill your measure like your fathers’ measure.
O ye children of the serpent, life! How do you flee from the judgment of hell?
Therefore, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes, and from them you slay and crucify, and flog them in your synagogues, and drive them from city to city.
In order that your blood may be pure, every drop of it must be shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel, a friend, to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachia, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth: all of this comes upon this generation! Jesus mourns Jerusalem
«O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, who kills her prophets and smothers her messengers! How often have I longed to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
Behold, your house is left to you in ruins.
Because I say to you: “You do not see me from this time until you say: ‘Blessed is that which comes in the name of the Lord!’”
Signs of the End Times
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples went to hurry and show him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, “Do you not see all this? Truly, I tell you, no stone will be left upon another stone without collapse!”
And while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him secretly, saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “Behold, I do not fail to guide you.”
Verily, many will come in My name, saying, “You are the Messiah!” And they will mislead many.
And you will hear of wars and news of wars. Look, do not be afraid. For it is certain that all these things will be, but the end is not yet here.
Because nations rise and fall, and kingdoms rise and fall, and famines and plagues and earthquakes occur in places.
But these are all the beginning of pains.
Then they will hand you over to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations for my name.
And then many will stumble and recognize each other, and hate each other.
Many liars claim to be prophets and mislead many people.
And the more sin there is, the more the love of many is cooled.
But he who endures until the end is that who will be saved.
With this proclamation of the kingdom of heaven, Weigers offers a witness to all nations in every inhabited place. Then comes the end.
“And when did you see ‘the Outrage of Destruction’ that Daniel the prophet said would be standing in the holy place –to let the reader understand-”
Then let the people of the Law flee to the mountains.
And he who is on the surface, does not descend to take anything from his house.
And he who is in the field and does not return to take his cloak.
Woe to her who brings forth and those who nurse!
So that you don't flee in winter or on Saturday.
And it will be a great narrowness, like which there never was since the beginning of the world, nor ever will be.
Even if those days did not fail, the body did not heal. But for the chosen ones, those days were shortened.
Then, if one says to you, “Behold, the Messiah is here!” or, “He is there!” do not believe him.
Because false prophets and lying prophets will arise, and will speak great things and will show great signs and wonders, to lead astray the elect, even if possible.
I already told you that.
If they say to you: “Here it is in the wilderness!” then do not go out. If they say to you: “Here it is in the deceitful one!” then do not believe.
For as the lightning comes from the east and appears in the west, so shall the coming of the Son of man be.
Wherever the vulture is, there the vultures gather.
And as for the time after those days of distress, the sun darkened, and the moon did not give its light, and the stars fell from the sky, and the forces of the heavens were shaken.
And then the العلامة of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud of heaven with great power and majesty.
Angels will send him with a great trumpet of sound, gathering his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
And they learned from the fig tree an analogy: when its branch yields figs and puts forth its leaves, you know that near is the summer.
Thus you are, like yourselves, when you see all this, know that it is near, at the doors.
I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass until all of this is accomplished.
The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. Be ready always.
And concerning this day and this hour, no one knows them except My Lord and His angels.
As in the days of Noah, so will also the Son of Man be.
As they were in the days before the Flood, they eat and drink and marry and give in marriage, until the day Noah entered the Ark.
And they did not know until the Flood came and took all, so it will be also with the coming of the Son of Man.
Then, if two are in the field, one is taken and the other left.
Two grind on the millstone, one is taken and the other is left.
Guard ye diligently, for ye know not the hour when thy Lord cometh.
Know this: if the Lord of the House knew when the thief would come, He would not have left His house unguarded.
Therefore, you yourselves be ready also, for it is at an hour that you do not suppose that the Son of Man comes. Like a servant faithful.
Who is the faithful, wise servant that his master set over them to give them their food in due season?
Blessed is that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing such things!
I tell you the truth: he values it above all his wealth.
But if the base slave says in his heart: My Lord, your arrival is delayed.
He begins to beat his companions and eats and drinks with the drunkards.
That servant of His will come on a day he does not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
He cuts it up and makes its portion with the courtiers. There, there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Like the chaste women ten
Then the kingdom of heaven is likened unto ten virgins: two
Five of them were wise women, and five were foolish women.
The ignorant women took their lamps, but they did not take with them any oil.
And as for the wise women, they took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
And as the groom was delayed, they all drank and rejoiced.
And at the middle of the night there was a shout: “Behold, the bridegroom comes; go out to meet him!”
All those virgins were chastened and their lusts were reformed.
The ignorant women said to the wise women, “Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.”
She replied with wise sayings: Perhaps it is not enough for us, but go to the merchants and buy for yourselves.
As they were going to obtain things, the groom arrived, and the women who were preparing went with him to the wedding, and the door was closed.
Finally, the rest of the virgins also spoke, saying, “Lord, Lord, open to us!”
And he replied, saying: I tell you the truth, I do not know you.
Stay up if only because you do not know the day or the hour that is coming upon you, like as a trespasser.
As if a traveler had prayed for his servants and their possessions.
He gave one five zehnts, another two zehnts, and another one zehnt. Each according to their strength. And he traveled to the time.
He who took the five measures of wheat and traded them, earned five more measures.
And he who took the two weights, also won two more weights.
As for the one who took the weight, he went and dug in the earth and concealed his master’s silver.
After a long time, the master of those slaves came and accounted for them.
He who took the five talents and gave five talents back said to the master, “Here are five talents more that I gained upon it.”
His mistress said to him: “Yes, you faithful and trustworthy slave! You were trustworthy in little, so I appoint you to much. Enter your master’s joy.”
Then came he who took the two balances and said, “O my Lord, two balances you entrusted to me. Behold, two others I have gained above them.”
His master said to him: “Indeed, you are a trustworthy and faithful slave! You were trustworthy in little, so I appoint you to much. Enter your master’s joy.”
Then there was also the one who took a single weight and said, “O Master, I know that you are a harsh human being, you reap where you did not sow, and you gather where you did not put in seed.”
I have exalted you and sent you ahead, and I have hidden your weight in the earth. Behold, this is yours.
And his master replied to him: “You wretched and lazy slave, you know that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered.”
It should have been placed at the bank, when I came, I was taking what was mine with interest.
Take the weight from it and give it to the one who has ten weights.
For every one who has, it is given to him, and increased; and for those who do not have, that which is taken from them is taken away.
And the defeated slave they cast into the external darkness, there tears and gnashing of teeth are. The lamb and the fattened calf.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory with all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
And before Him gather all the nations, and He distinguishes some from others as a shepherd distinguishes sheep from goats.
He will set the sheep on his right and the he-goats on his left.
Then the king says to those on his right hand: “Come, you blessed of my Father, mourn the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.”
Because I was hungry, you fed me. Because I was thirsty, you quenched me. I was a stranger, you sheltered me.
I am naked, visit me. I am sick, treat me. I am imprisoned, you came to me.
And they will say to Him, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?”
When you saw us as strangers, you sheltered us; when you saw us as naked, you clothed us.
When you saw us ill or confined, did you visit us?
And the king replied to them, “Truly I say to you, because you did this thing to your brother of the poor, it will be done to you.”
“And he also says to those on the left: ‘Depart from me, you cursed ones, to the eternal fiery furnace for Satan and his angels,’”
Because I am hungry, you have not fed me. I am thirsty, you have not quenched my thirst.
I was a stranger, you did not receive me. Naked, you did not clothe me. Sick and imprisoned, you did not visit me.
Then they also say to him, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? Or a stranger and not welcome you, or sick and not care for you, or imprisoned and not set you free?”
He replies to them, saying: “Truly I say to you: since you did not do this to the least of these my brothers, you did not do it to me.”
Those shall go to eternal torment and the righteous to eternal life.
The conspiracy to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples:
You know that in two days it will be the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the heads of the priests and the scribes and the elders of the people came to the house of the chief priest named Caiaphas.
And they consulted to seize Jesus by craftiness and to kill him.
But they said, “Do not cause a disturbance among the people on the day of the festival.” They poured ointment on Jesus.
While Jesus was in the house of Simon the Pharisee at Capernaum,
The woman approached him with a bottle of perfume, pouring it over his head as he was leaning against a wall.
And when his disciples saw this, they were angry, saying, “Why this waste?”
“This good could have been sold for much more and given to the poor.”
And Jesus said to them, “Why are you troubling the woman? She has done to me a good deed!”
For the poor are with me always, but I am not with you always.
She poured this fragrance upon my body only to suffice for me.
I tell you the truth: as this gospel is proclaimed throughout the whole world, it also tells what has been done to her as a memorial. Judas’ betrayal.
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests
He said, “What do you want to give me and I will hand it over to you?” They gave him three hundred silver coins.
And from that time on, he was seeking an opportunity to deliver it. The Passover meal with the disciples.
On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples approached Jesus and said to him, “Where should we prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
He said, “Go to the city, to so-and-so, and say to him: The teacher says: my time is near. What shall I do with my students?”
The students did as Jesus commanded and prepared the Passover.
And when evening settled upon the twelve.
And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.”
They were very astonished, and each of them began to say to Him: “Are You He, O Lord?”
He replied and said: “Whoever immerses his hand with me in the bowl shall deliver me!”
The son of humankind is destined as it is written, but woe to that man by whom the son of humankind is delivered. It would have been good for that man if he had not been born!
Judas replied to his master and said, “Am I you, my lord?” He said to him, “You said it.” The Lord’s Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take it and eat. This is my body.”
He took the cup and thanked them, and gave it to them saying, “Drink from it all of you.”
For this is my blood of the New Covenant, which was shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say to you: from this moment on, I will not drink of the fruit of the vineyard until that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.
Then you shall swim and go out to Mount Olivet. Jesus announces Peter’s denial to him.
Then Jesus said to them, “You all doubt in my heart tonight, because it is written: ‘I strike the shepherd, and the flock will scatter.’”
But after I have sent you up to Galilee.
And Peter answered him and said, “Though all do doubt you, I doubt not ever.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, you will deny me three times before the rooster crows.”
Peter said to him, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you!” All the disciples said so also. In Gethsemane.
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Stay here while I go and pray there.”
Then he took with him Peter and Peter’s son Zebedee, and he began to grieve and be depressed.
He said to them, “My soul is very sad, even unto death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
Then he advanced a little and fell face down, and he was praying, saying, “My father, if it is possible, please carry this cup for me, but not as I want it, but as you want it.”
Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “You men of little faith, why do you have only one loaf for five thousand men?”
Keep watch and pray so that you will not experience a trial. “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
He also waited a second and prayed, saying: “My father, if you cannot express me this chalice except by my drinking it, then be pleased.”
Then they came upon them and found them also asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
He left them and continued on his way, and prayed three times, saying that very same words.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, “Sleep now, and rest.” Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
Let's go! Here comes the one who is to hand me over! “Seize Jesus.”
And while he spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, came with a multitude having swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
And He who delivered them gave them a sign saying, “That which I accept is He. Seize Him.”
As he went forward, he approached Jesus and said, “Peace be upon you, my Lord!” and he kissed him.
Jesus said to him, “Friend, why have you come?” Then they stepped forward and threw their hands on Jesus and seized him.
And if one of those who are with Jesus extends his hand and takes up a sword and strikes a slave of the president of the synod, and cuts off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Return your sword to its place. For everyone who takes up sword will be killed by the sword.”
Do you think I can't ask my father to provide me with more than twelve armies of angels now?
How should books be completed: “That is how they should be?”
At that moment, Jesus said to the crowds, “You came looking for me with swords and clubs, to arrest me, didn’t you? Yet every day I was with you teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me.”
And all of this was so that the books of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all his disciples left him and fled. Before the council of the Jews
And those who seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.
And Peter followed him closely to the house of the chief priest, and entered and sat with the servants, looking out at the beginning of the way.
And the heads of the priests and the elders and the entire council were seeking a false witness against Jesus that they might kill him.
They didn't find anything. And although many false witnesses came forward, they didn't find anything. But finally, two false witnesses stepped forward.
And they said, “This is what God says: ‘I will destroy the house of Israel, and in three days I will rebuild it.’”
The high priest stood up and said to him, “Answer me! What witnesses do these two bear on your behalf?”
As for Jesus, he remained silent. Then the chief priest said to him, “I implore you by the living God, tell us, are you the Son of God?”
Jesus said to him, “You are right! And I also say to you: from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on a cloud of heaven.”
The high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has trespassed! What more do we need to hear witnesses to? Now you have heard his blasphemy!”
“What do you see?” they replied, saying, “It is deserving of death.”
Then they spat on his face and cursed him, and others beat him up.
They say: “Prophesy to us, O Christ, who struck you?” Peter’s denial
But Peter was sitting outside the house, and a maidservant came to him and said, “And you were with Jesus the Galilean!”
He denied in front of everyone saying, “I don’t know what you’re saying!”
Then, as he went out into the hallway, he saw another one, and she said to those who were there, “And this was with Jesus the Nazarene!”
He also swore: “I don’t know the man!”
And after a while, the Comforter came, and said to Peter, “Truly you are also a Gentile, for your tongue shows you are a Greek.”
Then he began to curse and swear: “I don’t know the man!” And then the rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the words of Jesus, who had said to him, “Truly I tell you, before the rooster crows three times, you will deny me three times.” So he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged himself.
And when it was morning, all the heads of the priests and elders of the people consulted concerning Jesus, that they should kill him.
They tied him up and carried him away and brought him before Pilate the governor.
Then, when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that he was condemned, he felt remorse and returned thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, “I was wrong to acquit an innocent man.” They replied, “What does it concern us? You’re the one who sees clearly!”
He threw his silver coins into the altar and departed, then went on his way and strangled himself.
The heads of the priests took the silver and said, “It is not right to throw it into the treasury, for it is the price of blood.”
Search for and buy from it the field of al-Fakhari, a cemetery for strangers.
That's why that field is called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then they took thirty pieces of silver, the price of the eighth part which the sons of Israel had offered for the prophet Jeremiah’s life.
And they gave it to him about the field of Fakhari, as the Lord commanded him. Before Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor said to him, “Do you rule the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “You are right.”
While the priests and elders complained about him, he did not respond.
Then Pilate said to him, “Do you hear how they testify against you?”
He didn't answer, not with a single word, until the governor was very surprised.
And the governor was accustomed on the occasion of the holiday to release one cage for the group, whoever desired it.
And they had a famous prisoner at that time, whose name was Barabbas.
And they were asking him, “Which of these two do you want us to release?” Pilate said, “Both. You want to release both the man who has been called Christ, and Barabbas?”
He knew they had handed him over out of spite.
And as he was sitting on the armchair, his wife sent him saying, “Stay away from that, for I suffered greatly in a dream about him today.”
But the chief priests and elders incited the crowds to ask for Barrabas and kill Jesus.
And the governor replied to them, saying, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” They said, “Barabbas!”
Pilate said to them, “What shall I do with the Christ, this Jesus who is called the Messiah?” And the crowd shouted, “Let him be crucified!”
The governor said, “What evil have you done?” And they cried out, “Let him be crucified!”
Then Pilate, seeing that he could not proceed, and that sedition was rising, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood! Behold, I wash my hands as you see!”
And all the people answered and said, “His blood be upon us and upon our children.”
Then Barrabas released them, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to Pilate to be crucified. The soldiers’ mockery.
And the governor’s troops took Jesus to the governor’s house and gathered all the battalion around him.
They dressed him and put a red robe on him.
And they crowned him with thorns and put a crown of sharp spines on his head; and they bowed down to the ground before him, mocking him and saying, “Greetings, King of the Jews!”
They spat on him and took the fortress and struck him on the head.
After they mocked him, they took off his cloak and dressed him in his clothes, and led him to the cross. The cross
As they were going out, they found a man of Kairuan named Simon, and they made him carry his cross.
And when they came to a place called Gethsemane, which is called the “garden of the Skull”.
Give him a mixture of honey and bitterness to drink. And when he tasted it, he did not want to drink.
And when they crucified him, they cast his garments between themselves, selling them saying, “Let him who is worthy win these garments,” according to that which was said about the prophet: “Cast lots for his garments between you.”
Then they sat guarding him there.
And they wrote above his head, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.”
Then they crucified two robbers with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
And those who had passed by were rowing towards it, while shaking their heads.
They say: “You who destroy the structure and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”
And also the heads of the priests, who were mocking with the scribes and the elders, said:
He has ended [his mission], but he cannot save her! If he is the King of Israel, let him descend from the cross now, so we may believe in him!
He has placed his trust in God, so let Him rescue him now if He wills! For He said, “I am the Son of God!”
And thus, also the thieves who were with him were renting it to him. Death
And from the sixth hour darkness fell upon the whole earth until the ninth hour.
Around nine o'clock, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” that is, “God, God, why have you abandoned me?”
And they rose from those who were standing there when they heard him say, “It is Elijah calling me.”
And while waiting, one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with water and placed it on a reed and watered it.
The rest of them said, “Leave him. Let’s see if Elijah comes to redeem him!”
Jesus cried out in a loud voice and surrendered his spirit.
And the veil of the Temple was rent in twain, from top to bottom. And the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent.
The graves were opened, and many bodies of the holy sleepers rose up.
And they emerged from the graves upon His resurrection, and entered the Holy City, and appeared to many.
And as for the centurion and those who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the manner of his death, they were filled with great fear, and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”
And there were many women who looked on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee and were serving him.
And among them were Mary Magdalene, the mother of James, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons, and Mary. The burial
And when it was evening, a rich man from Ramah came, whose name was Joseph, and he was also a disciple of Jesus.
And he delivered him to be crucified.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen.
He placed him in his new grave, which he had carved in the rock, and then rolled a large stone onto the tomb door and departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting beside the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
And on the day following the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came unto Pilate.
They say: “O master, you reminded us of that misguided man who said while alive: ‘I will undertake this in three days.’”
“So he ordered that the tomb be secured until the third day, lest they gain entrance and, having robbed him, say that he arose from the dead; and that a delusion might be spread among the people, worse than this.”
Then Pilate said to them, “You have guards. Go, secure him as you know how.”
They proceeded and secured the grave with guards and sealed the stone.
The apocalypse
After the Sabbath, at the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the tomb to look.
And if a great earthquake occurs, because the angels of God will descend from the heavens and come and roll the stone away from the door, and sit upon it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white like snow.
And their guards trembled with fear, and they became like the dead.
And the angel answered the two women and said, “Do not be afraid, for you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who has been crucified.”
He isn't here, because he did as he said! Look at the place where the Lord lay.
And go, say to your disciples: “He has risen from the dead. He is ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.” “Behold, I have told you.”
And they quickly exited the tomb in fear and great joy, racing to inform their disciples.
And as they were setting out to inform their students that when Jesus met them and said to them, “Peace be with you,” they advanced and took hold of his feet and knelt down to him.
Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go, say to my brothers that they go to Galilee, there they will see me.” Words of the guards
As they were going, a company of the guards came to the city and informed the heads of the priests of everything that had been.
Gather with the elders, consult, and give the army a lot of silver.
They say: “Say that my disciples came at night and stole him while we were asleep.”
And if he hears it at the governor, then we beseech him, and we make you secure.
And they took the silver and did as they were commanded, and this report spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appeared to the disciples.
And as for the eleven disciples, they went to Galilee unto the mountain, where Jesus had commanded them.
And when they saw him, they fell down to him in worship, but some of them doubted.
And Jesus went on his way, and they said to him, “You have given to every commander in the heaven and on the earth authority.”
Go and teach all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to memorize everything I have commanded you. “And I am with you all the days until the end of time.” Amen.
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the Prophets: “Behold, I send my angel before thee, to keep thy way.”
A resounding voice in the wilderness: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.”
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
And all the balls of the Jews and the people of Jerusalem came out to him, and they all depended on him at the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
And John wore a camel’s hair garment, and a leather hosen, and ate barley cakes with honey.
And he was preaching, saying, “After me comes one who is mightier than I, whom I am not worthy to bow my head and unlatch the shoes of.”
“I baptize you with water, but he who is coming after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” John 3:3, The baptism of Jesus Christ and his temptation
And in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as he rose from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descended upon him.
And a voice from the heavens said, “You are my beloved son, in whom I delight.”
And he brought the soul out to the wilderness.
And there were forty days in the wilderness, where he was tested by Satan. And he was with the beasts, and the angels of God were serving him. The call of the first disciples
And after John had yielded, Jesus came to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of the kingdom of God.
He says, “The time has been completed and the kingdom of God is near, so repent and believe in the Gospel.”
And as he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me, and you will become fishers of men.”
They left the net and followed it.
Then he passed by them a little way and saw Jacob ben Zebedee and John his brother, and they were in a boat plying the nets.
Invite them to spend some time. So they left their father, Zibdi, on the ship with the rudder and went after him. Expelled a foul spirit.
Then they entered KafarNahum, and at that time the assembly entered on the Sabbath and began to teach.
We were surprised by his teaching because he taught them as one with authority, not like a scribe.
And there was among them a man with a demon, so he cried
He said, “Ah! What have you done, Jesus the Nazarene? You have come to destroy us! I know who you are: Holy God!”
Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and get out of him!”
Let the spirit of impurity be vanquished, and cry out with a great voice, and he shall be expelled from it.
They all stirred, and some asked each other, saying, “What is this? What is this new teaching? Because a sultan orders even the unclean spirits to obey!”
His expertise was for the time in every ball surrounding the Sea of Galilee. Healing of Givat Shimon and others.
And when they had come out from the assembly, they went unto the time to the house of Simon Peter and Andrew, with James and John.
Gaza of Shimon was lying feverish, and they informed him about it for the time being.
She advanced and presented it to Masika with her hand, so she left them in the heat for a moment and began to serve them.
And when evening came, when the sun had set, they brought to him all the drunkards and the madmen.
And the whole city was gathered at the doors.
Many were healed who were afflicted with various diseases, and many demons were cast out, and the demons would not speak, because He knew them. The preaching in Galilee
And at very early dawn, he rose and went out, and proceeded to a place of solitude, and he would pray there.
And he followed him along with سمعان and those with him.
And when they found him, they said to him, “All people are seeking you.”
He said to them, “Let us go to the neighboring village so that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”
He was preaching in their synagogues throughout Galilee and casting out demons. Healing of a leper.
Then a leper came to him, asking him, “If you are willing, you may cleanse me.”
Jesus opened his mouth and stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “Be cleansed!”
While he was speaking, he spoke about leprosy and purity.
He scorned him and sent him to time.
He said to him, “Look, do not tell anyone anything, but go and offer yourself to the priest and present what was commanded by Moses as evidence for them.”
As for him, he went out and began to call out and announce the news repeatedly, until he could no longer enter the city in public; rather, he was outside in secluded places, and they would come to him from every direction.
Healing for a paralyzed person
Then Kafarnaum also came to him after days, and he heard that he was at rest.
And by the time, many people gathered until there was no room left, neither around the door. He would then address them with a word.
And they came to him bearing a gift, carried by four.
And when they could not approach him for the crowd, they made an opening in the roof, where it was. And after they had searched it, they found the bed which was hidden, lying upon it.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your faith has made you well.”
And there were a company of scribes sitting there, pondering in their hearts:
Why does he speak in this manner with arrogance? Who is it except God alone who can forgive sins?
At that time, Jesus spoke to his disciples, saying, “Why do you think about this in your hearts?”
It is easier to say to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven you,” than to say, “Rise and take up your bed and walk”?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins.” He said to the paralytic:
“And to you I say: go, carry your own bed, and go to your house!”
He hastened the time and carried the bed and went out in front of everyone, until all were dazzled and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this before!” A call from Levi.
Then he also went out to the sea. And all the people came to him and taught them.
And as he was passing by, he saw Levi ben Glical sitting at the place of extortion, and said to him, “Follow me.” So he rose up and followed him.
And while he was sitting in their house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples, because they were many, and they followed him.
And as for the Pharisees and the scribes, when they saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, “Why does he associate with tax collectors and sinners?”
And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Healthy people do not need a doctor, but sick people do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” Question about fasting
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to Him, “Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, while your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the wedding feast fast with the groom? For as long as the groom is with them, they cannot fast.”
But there will come days when the husband will raise them, and then they will fast on those days.
No one patches a new patch onto an old garment, otherwise the new patch takes from the old and the fabric becomes worse.
No one makes new wine in an old alley, lest the new wine break into the alley, for the wine strengthens and the alley decays. Rather, they make new wine in a new alley. Saturday’s Eve.
He passed by the fields on Saturday, and his students began harvesting the grain as they proceeded.
The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they on the Sabbath violate that which is allowed?”
He said to them: “Have you ever read about what David did when he was in need and hungry, along with those who were with him?”
How did the House of the Lord enter in the days of Abu'athar, the chief priest, who ate the bread of offering that was not permitted to be eaten except by the priests, and gave also to those who were with him.
Then He said to them: “The Sabbath was created for man, not man for the Sabbath.”
“And if a son of man is the Lord of the Sabbath also.”
Healing on Saturday
Then he also entered the assembly, and there was a man with a dry hand.
They began to watch him: Will he heal on Saturday? So that they could complain about him.
He said to the man with the dry hand: “Stand in the middle!”
Then he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a soul or to kill?” They fell silent.
He glared at them with anger, saddened by the harshness of their hearts, and said to the man: “Extend your hand.” He did, and his hand returned to be as healthy as the other.
The Pharisees and Herodians consulted together, seeking to put Jesus to death. The crowd followed Jesus.
Then Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee and Judea followed him.
And from Jerusalem, and from Edom, and from the borders of Jordan. And those who were around Beersheba and Sidon, a very great multitude, when they heard how it was done, came unto him.
He told his disciples to follow him in a small ship for the purpose of the gathering, so that they would not bother him.
Because he had healed many, so that a diseased person came to him, longing to touch him.
And the foul spirits, when their gaze darted towards him, screamed, saying, “You are the son of God!”
I advised them strongly not to show it. The Selection of the Twelve Apostles
Then he ascended the mountain and called those whom he wanted, and they went unto him.
And He appointed twelve, and sent them out to Him, saying, “Go and preach.”
And they will have dominion over healing the illnesses and driving out devils.
And he gave to Simon the name Peter, which means Rock.
Jacob ben Zbad and John, Jacob’s brother, and for them they gave the name Buanarges, which is to say, son of thunder.
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, John the Zealot, Jude, Simon the Zealot
Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed him. Then they came to a house. Jesus and Beelzebul
They gathered until they were not even able to afford bread.
And when his relatives came out to seize him, because they said, “He is insane!”
And those scribes who had come from Jerusalem said, “Away with him, for Baal-Zebub and Rimmon and Sheol are his messengers!”
And He called them and said to them with parables: “How can a demon cast out a demon?”
And the kingdom divided itself, and it could not be supported.
And when a household breaks up, it is unable to stand firm, that household.
