What a pity! This is an opportunity we shouldn't miss.
Also, I don't interfere. I take my right, and you really have the right to take before me.

Salih, don't be..... God forgive me!
Come on, man. Would a brother advise his brother with the kind of talk you're saying?

I found a great feast.
Determination is nobody's business.
Say it to yourself.
This feast will not be before us again.
Don't be a stranger, oh! Saleh.
And take the opportunity from us
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do that.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone benefits.
This is the rule!
Even people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the chairman of a massive project.
This means he is dominant.
Third Millennium International Beaches, more specifically, the first phase of the infrastructure.
This person is very stupid.
Here we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to exploit her.
When his car wouldn't start
Who used to drive him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to fill your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be stupid and be stubborn.
Take it easy.
See Uncle Khamees
And now, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The other third is the commission.
One who plays in a popular band,
They say he was at a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
Do you know what they did?
Add zero.
There's no use, Auntie!
No, God guides him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
For the triumph of good.
And God willing, good will prevail.
This is common.
Let's keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about the subject.
Do we need to worry?
Just my friends.
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
In the morning for two hours.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him in a bit.
And we need to convince him.
He's cutting into our profits.
They actually let him change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Osman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day at work.
Rely on me.
However you can get it!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get some?
Father, I ask you.
If you're hungry and walking down the street
Do you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
We're still working on the first article for the meeting.
If I were good,
If you have any inquiries
What exactly do I want to know?
It's legitimate.
God guide you, Saleh!
This is reasonable because you are a board chairman for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will organize our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So no one suspects what we're doing.
Let's post our share as a separate article!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
What can be.
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
It just shows you have some concerns.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said it!
Let's say it's his car.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear that from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he's going to start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to get anything?
We'll finish and won't get anything!
He wants to eat it alone, bite by bite.
Don't shake your head!
"Nor your brother either."
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked to him all night.
I told him, "Whatever the case, they are your relatives."
Finally, he agreed.
This is how things should be.
And God willing, you won't get it all at once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
More specifically, infrastructure.
Then they begin the second phase.
And you're sticking with him.
May God reward you with good.
Good thing you made him agree.
You're no different from them.
Okay, never mind.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said even after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to determine the project budget.
They need to follow up, it's their money.
We put it there and we're sure about it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my brother-in-law sharing with me.
Do you mean him?
Responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishes.
Fine, fine.
How much do you want to get done?
How much are you going to get?
It's that we take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think about it.
And determine the amount of money we will get.
There are people waiting and they want a little bit.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million,
During this week, everyone will think deeply.
And they specified the amount they want.
By next week, they'll decide and determine how much they want.
It's not your right.
Then, the decision is up to you?
Ignore him.
Hello, my friend. What's wrong? What's the matter?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Salih, is your brother's name Sultan?
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car doesn't work.
Write.
"Sands of Abdullah"
No, no, there are three more people.
What else can I do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, men. Let's discuss the budget and get it over with."
No, no, this requires a sum of money.
How much should I charge him?
God helps him, does he have children?
Yes, he has it, make it twenty-five thousand and four hundred.
Four hundred
They're adding it by force.
How much are you going to give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her.
Yes, Mama.
Ah, no, no, no, this one! Oh, my son!
No, my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's up?
Why are you upset?
But from the first stage, the infrastructure specifically.
Not used
Guest of three thousand
Buy me watches from Thailand with shiny stress.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mom.
No, Mom, I added her, but I just wanted to confirm the name.
My love, Mama
Let's enlarge the feast.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone needs to decide on the amount they want.
I have it with me.
Is one million enough!
This is extra, my dear.
Oh! Guys, oh! Guys, wait, it's noisy, give us a chance.
The committee is currently in a meeting to approve the project's budget. We won't be discussing financial matters now. That's all.
I want more.
We told you not to embarrass us, we're in the ministry's square.
Oh, we're screaming, don't attract our attention.
If someone comes and asks: "What are all of you doing here?"
We'll tell him that the power is out or there's a shock.
Don't make a noise, this is the ministry's courtyard.
%pw Silent %pw Silent
Sew it! Do you hear me!
"How much is the budget now that I'm with them?"
Without counting my brother
Totally, 50 million %pw
Fifty million only for the first phase.
How much does it cost now?
What, Saleh?
Participation means engagement, man!
In any case, bon appétit.
Come on, quickly, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem. The main thing is, we don't want any discussions. Just get them to agree on the budget and that's it.
And implementation starts from tomorrow.
It serves a very large segment of society.
God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beaches Project.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
It's for future generations.
Certainly, on behalf of our team, we would like to welcome you and congratulate you on the launch of the project tomorrow, as far as I know.
It took us about a year and a half.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
God preserve the blessing of oil for us.
Stage two, three, and ten.
The delegate.
Welcome aboard.
Why did you gather us here? When will the cars arrive to pick us up?
What? Where do they need to take us?
Praise be to God, I've grown up and become a sheep.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, she's a good girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they isolate you?
Eman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I was wondering who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
This is not the earth.
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father's.
By the way, why are you asking about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Those who work hard and invest in land, real estate, companies, and make an effort.
Free from headaches.
I'm upset with you, Iman!
And also, my sister.
How would you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than the truth.
For the money.
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No, thanks.
The brothers of Umm Sulaym are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that...
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I don't mean that your brothers are like hers, God willing, no.
How many years have passed since my father's death?
Why is she asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Is the check paid to her every three months?
Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not her right.
If it were another person, his sisters wouldn't take even a single Rial.
I understood it.
Where from?
As if it's not my money.
Look what, Monira
Please see it.
Become fifty thousand.
Because I had the courage to ask about my father's land, which is in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than this.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What should I say, oh! Manar
I won't stop fighting for my rights.
Take my right.
It's best to invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
People have lost their compassion.
Don't think your brothers will be better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from it at all.
Why are they doing this?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear, be kind to them.
Treat them kindly.
And you will get tired of them.
Why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand of us.
If we reach the million like other countries.
I really doubt, my dear, that he's issuing an order.
Look at my brothers.
I swear, my father doesn't want all this.
What am I saying, dear!
"I can only say that Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of our affairs."
"Hazbunnallah wa ni'ma al-wakil" Translation: "God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs."
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, my dear!
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times.
My love, they will invest millions, and you're just watching them.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And no one will take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'm satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
Men ask you!
She has a little bit.
Just some questions about her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can find him
I'll take you there and show it to you.
He'll find his way.
I signed a waiver.
Two hundred and fifty, that's more than enough for her, her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why is she asking now?
He's just greedy.
As if it's not real.
This is my father's inheritance, and he decides how much I should take. I take it or leave it.
It's neither mine nor his to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
The reason is money.
It was opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they charge.
Even the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
And I won't leave them alone.
How are you going to get back to them?
It's not your right.
And what's it to you, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him a formal power of attorney.
Who makes him check almost everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He's shouting at us.
Falcon, enough.
Brother Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go now.
Excuse me, go.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and files a complaint against us,
He said that he hit him.
So we let him do what he wants!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to examine everything.
If he had seen the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he reviews the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight.
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is how much we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, so don't be afraid.
If he agrees, that's what we have, and if he agrees, then welcome.
Let them go and deal with it.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This should have been done from the beginning.
Yes, boss.
As he pleases.
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this should have happened sooner.
As you wish, my lord.
File by file
When she knew her true heritage,
Villas, and lands you didn't know about
They came out seven.
They came out sixteen.
She didn't know.
Poor thing, she was shocked.
Not fair
Don't leave them alone.
Oh, my son, I don't want to hear about courts.
The more interested I became,
The less the judge knows.
One minute.
And then he says his usual phrase,
To the seventh, the fourth, two thousand, I don't know how much.
They'll be very happy, my son.
You should never get out of bed, Mother!
May God heal you.
No, no, please come in.
Naseer and my sister Manar
After we knocked on the door and got him out of the company.
He sends one of my schoolmates.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
Does he mean he can influence them?
Inshallah, he will go.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts only produce reports.
Delays and bickering, empty lawyers
The years pass by.
And time passes by.
And you're not going to get even one penny.
God have mercy on Umm Sulaym's mother.
You advised me the day before she died.
Never go to court.
Our judge said
She died without taking any of her inheritance.
She died and the judge still hasn't resolved her case.
If we were like other countries,
Hala Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
The years passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
May God grant you abundance in blessings.
The most important thing
It is brotherhood.
Brother Rashid
You are my brother.
Don't let money problems
Do you have anything else you'd like to talk about besides my sister?
Excuse me.
Why do I have to ask him to stop talking?
It's true.
They don't even want me to take my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife,
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We're trying one last time.
You sent them your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman does.
He is a very kind man.
He said for sure, Nasser.
Don't worry.
Scare them with the law.
Did you forget what the poor mother of Salman said about the courts?
The brothers of Umm Sulaym do not fear the courts.
Just my brothers
He might be afraid of gossip.
They might be ashamed to go to court.
We'll wait and see what happens after Sheikh Abdurrahman visits them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What do you say, my son?
He is telling the truth.
Walk, %pw walk
I'm going to the court tomorrow morning.
Why do I have to postpone it until day after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What happens if I wait until after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid.
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he's begging me to go to court.
Because they knew you were serious about it, my dear.
It's important to visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this is it.
God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of a courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
God have mercy on you.
What did I say?
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until after tomorrow.
To get this sample from the courthouse.
I'm ready for you so I can show you the way.
You enter from that door, this door.
When you enter through the door,
Put all your things over there.
The mobile phone and anything metallic so it doesn't make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
Register the case, they'll ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight the elevator go.
Look for the offices.
See the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
Also, these
You want to sue us?
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you'll get your revenge.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're having dinner at my sister's house today.
Oh, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, I didn't believe her.
He said, "If they agree on the project, I'll invite you for dinner at my place."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
Oh, happy man, O father of Waleed!
Lucky is he
My sister told me he was so happy that he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Manal
He is not familiar with the business, but some good men helped him.
Okay, tell your father.
God willing, you liked the food.
Thank you, Waleed!
Thank you, Abu Waleed. May God bless you.
May God fill your life with blessings.
Delicious food once, mother and child.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me just to rent an office and they would take care of everything.
Please, uncle.
Oh, my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We need a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you'd give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project's owner, my father, Abu Waleed.
Please excuse us.
Congratulations, Abu Waleed.
You deserve it.
Come on, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Guys, there's a story behind this project.
I'm telling you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
What I know about it now
This is a catalog of a manufacturer of multi-purpose halls, our ministry is approaching them, submit to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
That's what he understands.
Any contractor
Japanese people are awesome.
When you open it, the computer says "computer, computer, computer, computer."
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, press kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
How's your contract with the factory?
I paid a little.
Earnest money
Above all, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place my first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
We're still waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Do you want to drink tea?
Oh Waleed, tell me, what have you done!
You don't know Abu Fahd, he might come, and he might not.
One day,
He doesn't have time.
"Come on, let's go"
You are the boss here.
Are you going to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Abu Fahd's signature.
What should I do?
God helps you.
Only fifteen minutes left until Monday! Oh, boy!
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
God helps you, come tomorrow.
I said that you know the manager from a long time ago and he is your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useful manager to us.
A very stupid manager, they don't do anything.
It's a shame they appear wise when they're not.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything? Never!
They don't move the chair without Bou Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems like you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
And if they ask about you
It's not only you who's waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he's coming today.
Please sit down.
Or walk.
I'll talk to you when he comes.
If anything happens, I'll call. Don't scare them.
Goodbye
Sorry if I scared you, this is my wife.
Hey boy, they agreed to my two-month-old appointment,
I just need him to sign, what's this?
Oh my son! This is the registration period, my daughter will miss the university scholarship, her papers need to be processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers are going to be lost.
He's drinking his coffee. When he's done, you can come and see him.
Please, he asked all of you to be quiet.
Yes, Chief
Goodbye
Wait, wait, guys!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
Know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a unique voice.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have been halted, my brother.
We wait for Bou Fahad every day.
What can we do, we wait for Abu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, O father.
He is blameless.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
Inform him that the deadline has passed.
Your aunt is a different story.
Poor thing, she lent him money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Mom, I'm really worried about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you going to call?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
So we can talk about the factory and your brother's wife's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Dad, how much longer do you want me to wait?
They always say,
We are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Oh! Dad, I tried as much as I could.
But all my friends are joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Okay, who are you going to talk to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You were very patient with us.
God helps you.
Bu Waleed is in a pitiful state.
He is shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
This is because the allotted time is almost up.
There are five days left.
He's going to lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
What's better! Pulls me, pulls me, pulls me.
I wish I could improve. I feel...
I have a strange fever.
The top is shaking.
Part two is completely static.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
My sister helps.
She's waiting for us to return her money.
May Allah reward her with good.
We're not worried about your sister now.
My manager is still here, God help me.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what he intends to do.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
He's drawing me in, that's the problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth is going to be gone.
Don't pull us.
Exactly in the brain, in the brain.
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel for you and I'm in pain for you.
Stay on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
You were a role model.
Don't think I don't know you're leaving work early every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What's up with your phone?
Instead of deducting from you.
I'll leave you on the stock committee.
Are you going to the market with them today?
Never leave the job during working hours.
If you do
Don't blame me later.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him looking puzzled, holding his phone and waiting for their call?
I'm afraid he'll get fired from his job.
This is my phone, oh! Abu Waleed
He is poor.
Let him go, poor thing.
Oh! Bou Walid
Yes, hello
What's wrong with you, Abu Waleed? I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
It's the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
"Or you want"
House by house
Walk forward.
Guys, this man is crazy.
Do you know how much I spent?
Throughout all these years, you
He took the papers, and brought the papers back again.
My legs are getting tired now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries.
We were just kids.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back just like packs of kids' chips.
Afterwards, God willing, I learned to ride a bicycle.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They were trying to flirt with me when I was riding this bike, oh my god.
It's our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager has arrived.
We need to celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Are you planning to quit your job?
I testify that you are indeed a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother, see you later.
We're all at your service.
Don't you want us to give you a one-year extension?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You already gave me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
Last, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
You're just a delivery driver.
With the traitors
Do you believe that
I haven't eaten candy for four years.
Very delicious
I can smell it now.
We'll do everything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the papers?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm bored.
Alright, I'm done.
Stay in touch.
My son, Khalid
From this moment on,
"God willing, I'll rest." (Note: "%pw" seems to be a placeholder or abbreviation, which doesn't translate directly.)
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Alright, alright, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he couldn't leave the job.
What do you intend to do?
I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he feels bored.
This is good for him.
Are you going to let him rest?
Poor him, he's happy to be going home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
I sent him to finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone has to rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the khonafrush.
Mama won't break.
I never regretted selling my daughter, oh! My daughter,
But I say, ever since he quit his job and left,
And Khalid gave him tasks to do.
He's sleeping in his room.
Those who were lost in their sea (singing)
Good morning, father.
Hello, my daughter.
Daddy, please.
But they also called me and said the manager is angry.
Let me see your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't gained independence.
Poor me
I'm waiting for you, and the beggar is in front of me.
We'll eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, dear dad.
God helps you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I'm gone, my daughter, I'm gone.
Oh God, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God willed it.
Good that you found a house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay at home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do, Umm Saeed?
They're going through a tough time, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, rest.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
The thief eats it.
Poor thing, she's so tired.
And from the taxis
He is naive.
The market branch is closed.
They want her ID.
She didn't take her car.
And he gave him the papers.
I'm feeling better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
The lunch is very delicious.
I was moving from one ministry to another.
I run from one ministry to another,
Finishing my children's paperwork
You took care of them when they were young, and now you're taking care of them, you're spoiling them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what can I do?
There are meetings every day, either with the manager, or with the president, or with the minister.
They have nice jobs, when they are needed they have to be there, this is %pw work.
"So that you can go and finish your work, other people stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking?"
I'm coming now. May God reward you kindly.
See you later, goodbye.
Excuse me now, oh! oh! Bo Shahin
They called me and said it's ready.
If you sell your father tomorrow, your work will be done.
If so, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
This is because he loves you.
Even though he's upset and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is tired and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Let him give you the papers.
And go ahead and finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until the afternoon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want to delay the construction of my building?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your papers need to be finished tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he has to be there.
What's wrong with you, sir?
Suppressing his tears
In fact, I didn't lie to my parents.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh! Dad, don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with these girls
Deceived him.
Quite enough
I apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you.
Oh! Dad, Khalud is...
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he found out the committee wasn't coming.
We are blessed through you.
From now on, Dad!
We do our personal work ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss your head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Ah! My dearest father.
The whole world is worth nothing to me.
I don't want you to be sad.
"And not annoyed"
As I told you,
After I finish this research
I wanted to do it myself.
And he asked me to come at once.
I have a meeting.
With the happiness of the minister
It's my pleasure.
You meet important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with him.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Bou Saada?
Please, Daddy,
The package is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Just drop by, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Beloved father
Do you mean it didn't happen?
He might have forgotten.
Because the committee is going to meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He's taking a week off and going to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He's enjoying himself there once.
And imagine what
They say he's a good cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What's the problem?
What's wrong with you, Professor?
May God guide you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, there's nothing wrong.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers to
I'm thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this one off, I don't want it.
Do not write this.
I like to keep them guessing.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
Sorry, sister.
They call it my league and cup.
He talked about the referee of the match.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him the title of "the one who stopped corruption."
People started inciting him.
Get him some lines he can say on TV and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Believe it or not, sister,
These days, everyone is only concerned about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I never will.
Let him speak, and say his famous quote, "Stop the corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your coming.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, mom.
Listen, my son
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Present, Mother.
I will never call.
Radio or television, and I won't call Q-tell.
Your sister, Aisha, was
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
"God have mercy on us, may God have mercy on you."
As I said.
Stop talking nonsense.
Because I don't want you to be sad.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
And he said, "It is done."
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he'll bring you to court to divorce his daughter.
Present, Mother.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't agree.
Sorry, I have to go now.
Just stay calm, I say.
The manager told me that
That's what makes you work here.
Because you can talk about management.
And they started to get us into trouble.
How is the manager going to justify this decision?
He has a million excuses to make.
Where are you going!
Are you serious, resign.
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, because of public interest.
We need to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, just once, say "Stop corruption."
This is terrible.
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work to do.
It's a disaster.
Until this problem is solved
What did I tell you?
I told you they were going to fire him.
And Mona was standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, I did it.
I heard them say it myself.
Please leave, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after they fired him.
Just because we're relatives,
Did you hear that?
Calm down.
Insha'Allah, everything will be fine.
May God guide you to the right path.
I came to drink coffee.
I know you.
I'm feeling bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to God, he'll take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if I leave,
Why do you want to get into trouble?
Just be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the man who stops corruption?
Yes, by God, it is he.
He doesn't seem to be doing well these days.
We want to hear it, at least once. Please, let us hear it.
No, that's all.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mom, I didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio program about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we spoke to him in front of people.
So I told my cousin, "Let's go to his house and talk to him alone."
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And he departed.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be mad and I won't talk to you ever, hear me?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, not yet, I've gotten rid of this habit, praise be to God.
You have a strong sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Even though I tried
Peace be upon you
Why did you come? You didn't need to come.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what's wrong with you?
I don't know him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh's corruption stop?
Are you Saleh, known as the Stop Corruption Foundation?
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
No vacancies, you know.
Good thing you didn't hire him.
Would I be crazy to hire him here?
I went everywhere, Manira.
Even one of them told me that five minutes before I came, there was a vacancy, but they rented it out, meaning they gave it to someone else.
My sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
He is trying to win the minister's favor.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this man is going to take my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I would be silent?
I just want this to happen in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
I'll finish him off.
Just how
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring it to your house.
And just give him the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and...
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I really quit that.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
This is Fahd; I spoke with him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we've heard his voice saying stop corruption."
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, valid.
I am diligent in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your kind words
Your radio talk is better.
Let's hear the stop of corruption once and for all.
Yes, please, just one, he's saying it's Abu Fahd, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
And then leave.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Listen to Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
My father wants to speak to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, he is %pw.
Don't you understand?
Wait, brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
One hundred and twenty units of poison = one unit of pressure.
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the credit.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Saleh, for stopping corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear her.
The final station of corruption... stop corruption.
Know
Necessity forced him to do so.
This is the last one.
The sultan dismissed him.
Did the minister fire him right away?
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bu Fahad can do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Sure, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was the last one, for sure. I won't do it again.
And here's my real job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he's afraid one day
And exposes his evil deeds.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They are afraid of you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha.
You are kind.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I assure you I will find a job.
People who criticize are stupid.
They are envious, they hate our country.
Do we have any problems?
We don't have any favoritism.
I haven't heard that word before.
In our government circles,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
"No matter what family you belong to, we never have those kinds of problems at all."
If the manager or supervisor gets upset with you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
No problems.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
There are no sweets until dinner.
I mean, there's no sweetness.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
God is enough for you, O righteous one!
Come and see what your mischievous nephew did.
I told you it was expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said don't worry, it will look nice on Waleed.
See what he did.
The shirt is not useful now.
That's why he's not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how he was planning to lift it, it's clear this was intentional.
The poor man's hand.
He was happy wearing this shirt for the first time.
He's going to see.
Where is the dentist?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Have some shame.
Don't argue with a child.
The child should be allowed to do what he wants.
It hasn't changed.
Don't ask me to watch my language.
Are you a repairman?
We will educate them.
Discipline yourself.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you arguing like children?
Stay away from this mother.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
He is a boy.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
Know
It's not your fault.
Let's go up.
They don't deserve it.
We're wasting our time responding to them.
One should
Where people loved each other
Okay, okay, I'm coming, goodbye, goodbye.
Sir, there are some papers that you need to sign. The minister wants to see them.
Alright, alright, I'll speak to the minister. Don't trouble yourself.
I saw the disaster, the calamity?
It's new, oh wow! Aisha
This isn't child's play.
You are right.
He ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This is not worn.
Look at Adol's pants, they can fit one leg, the other will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hand.
It looks like it was torn using a power saw.
"I can only say that God is sufficient for us."
I'm telling you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I still know
If you know how, take a lap around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike.
Also for another thing
You're telling the truth, right?
Okay, do you want some candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors to cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
Not that much.
No one else can do this.
Why do we have to be quiet?
The most important thing
It's that we insist on what we say.
Who tore the clothes? It's Walid, a child.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
It's impossible for a child to make these cracks.
Why don't you believe me?
Go find your quarter.
Give me a second.
You're always like this.
We fight every day, boy!
The past days
I ask for God's forgiveness and good health.
May God guide you.
Who can hold a pair of scissors this big?
Go and look for your friends.
Liar, once, oh mother.
He went and brought that big pair of scissors.
Act like a man! Sultan, come on.
Come and find a solution to this, come on, boy!
How am I going to start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child is born.
When the baby is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and make peace among yourselves.
Okay, tell me, what are you planning to do now?
And what, they tore their clothes?
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my papers and information. He ruined everything.
I won't leave him.
He speaks very formal Arabic, like the kind they speak in museums.
Ignore him.
He talks until he gets tired, then he leaves.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And you shook hands with each other.
He's filled with hatred and jealousy.
He's upset because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahd.
Solan, hit him, hit, hit.
Fear God, O children.
Hit him, hit him, [shut up] pay attention, [shut up]
Take your cousins, and play with them outside.
May God guide you.
God bless you.
Old men
What did you leave for the children?
Present, Mother.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
It might be the last time, boy!
You know it's the big brother, oh! Girls
He knows how to talk to people.
And they argue.
Don't be angry with me.
It's imposed on you.
Plays a role
May God guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, this is a conspiracy against us, and you say, %pw, stay away.
Go away.
There's blood coming from my son.
You're embarrassing us, you guys!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe it.
I saw them.
We told him they were children, but he didn't believe us.
"He said from his window."
He saw children throwing stones and, because he was far away, he thought they were adults.
I'm not crazy.
You can go.
You might be tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing stones.
It seems
Oh! Dear me.
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed a promise. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, God!
God protect us from the enemy.
Mother, mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, they just act like children, their minds are very sick.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, and this is the first time I see him.
And I noticed that he didn't take his eyes off you.
He's not enrolled in the business class.
He has only been attending the class with us for a week.
It's clear he's eager to get to know you.
Don't assume it's because he loves you that much, don't be too controlling of yourself.
No, my sister.
My father thinks I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it simple.
Now he's running after you, dying to know you.
It's true that I still love him.
No, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She's looking at you and*
Are you waiting for her to come and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself"?
Take the initiative.
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, Miss.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
We never got to know each other.
You are too old.
Means you have to go and say, "Excuse me,
May I introduce myself to you?
Is it that bad?
I need to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
Never forget us.
As long as I'm free.
He's buying the villa behind ours for Waleed.
When he gets married tomorrow, he won't live far from us.
There's no use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
Hello, hello, boy, good morning.
Uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you.
Hey Nora, come outside, the car is running now, come on, by yourself.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
The neighbours are talking to each other, what do you want?
It's better to leave us alone.
The neighbors are talking to each other, weirdo.
He parked his car behind mine, I can't get it out.
So if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic mood.
I see you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know you're Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely when they hear your father's name, many people will think you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yeah, right.
My friend at university, I know them, and she told me so.
He loves his acting, just see his works.
He finally said, "We're living next to a famous and valuable person in the community."
My heart, what a happiness
He's funny, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
They said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin, Aboud.
I can read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they're going to film a series about diving.
Lucky, he brought you sheep, a gift for your new villa.
It's proven that he's a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, O Abu Sa'd, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
This will be determined based on the need and experience of the staff.
What we know
We might not translate it.
You have to excuse me, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you
We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God blesses us with money, we'll buy the furniture.
I did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors help each other.
But now I heard and saw her.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So go with you.
Don't worry, sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan. If it's approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Don't hesitate to ask me anything.
We're like family now.
Can't your sister study without your help?
I just want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Should I lie and say he was my friend?
Oh! Boy, oh! Ali
I don't have anything against this.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
Let me introduce you to your cousin.
Leave it to me.
As you like it.
They will reject you.
Let's see.
Good night.
Good night.
What's wrong with you, Bou Ali?
Brother, the car broke down.
From time to time, this bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
Don't worry.
You don't need to exhaust yourself, my brother Rashid.
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems the Development Bank bought you a house and a car.
It's our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see relationships evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest and benefit to both parties.
Oh, that's a huge development.
Let's go.
Mom, this is embarrassing.
She didn't agree.
She said that Nour is like my daughter, and the driver will take her to university every day.
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear, no.
The driver said he would take her every morning.
God is a witness, O Mother of Ali.
They are good people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
Oh what a problem, what a problem, what am I going to do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who's going to take my daughter to university?
Oh! Bou Ali, now that Mr. Rashid Abdullah has referred me to you.
We can't refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Abu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, O Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is one sweet.
Guys, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Professor Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem.
Lucky, you have good relations.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, I'll get it for you.
What happened? What's wrong with you? Why are you grabbing me?
You're going to propose to Manal for me.
They agreed, Mother, they agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
More dresses, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
May Waleed get married again soon, the light of my eyes.
She called me, poor thing.
She's taking some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
She's going to go in a fancy car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I can't take my eyes off you.
This is a very old mother's kindness.
In addition to all this, she gave you the car.
With the driver.
If I went with you looking like this, they wouldn't believe that this decrepit man is the husband of this queen.
Oh God
Are you going in those clothes?
What! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They'll be shocked and think I'm a sheikh.
Get him some coffee, may God prolong his life.
Bu Ali, by God, I didn't recognize you. I thought you were someone important, not Bu Ali. You're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
Even your walk is different.
God bless you, the people I will suggest to you.
They are VIPs.
I've arranged everything from A to Z (from the car's headliner to its tires).
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series I acted in
There was a wedding, as I remember.
I was wearing shiny black shoes.
And my father also taught me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I've never worn thobes in my life.
God willing, you look very beautiful.
Like this, so when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
Always with me and with Kholood.
That's why.
You are my beloved.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter, Nour, to be far from us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed by this.
I'll tell her father, and God will be pleased with us for doing good.
Why did they reject him, for what reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, man!
I'm screaming from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
Nevertheless, I act honestly.
I perform on stage for several hours and my shift ends.
When the play is over.
You're role-playing.
I act.
I convey a useful vision.
Just you.
I wear costumes to play roles.
On the stage
Just you.
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The Role of the Rich and Wealthy Woman
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed!
Lift your head up.
This is a shame.
You missed the scene.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head," poor thing, it broke my heart.
And keep going straight.
Exactly like a horse.
It's Thursday, man, Thursday.
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he's doing it this way.
So he wouldn't see women, and no woman would see him.
See how his wife is nagging him.
Stay straight, don't turn your face.
Bury me in front of everyone in the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please show them the center of the city.
Thursday, show me the look of the city center.
Does your wife call it downtown Luke?
Let's go, Thursday
I'm going to see what Salem wants.
Poor thing.
When will you change!
If only you could hear what they're saying about you.
Even the elders say more than this.
Why are you doing this?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why is she so jealous?
Sometimes I sit in front of the TV.
She, she
I swear by God.
No, no, no problem.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
See that.
I just spoke to her in front of you; I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Be respectful to yourself and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
What's on your mind!
There's nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're spending time with these idle people.
Especially this fat man, he's the one I hate the most among your friends.
The one with chubby cheeks and hair like baby plants.
That rude person has no shame.
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, how are you?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Healthy, my friend! What happened!
Our friend Khamis is a gardener.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
He burst out laughing.
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and pictures himself talking to her.
God is sufficient for His wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He's busy right now, he's on an international call, very far away, and the call keeps cutting out.
What does the speech say?
God help you, Thursday!
Why are you awake!
I'm not sleeping, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they?
God guide you, Khamees!
These names are selected from the Minister's Office, the Minister's Bureau.
Okay, let's go.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why were you hiding afterward!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Just like that.
I saw the number you last called, read it, it's with you.
The last number!
You requested the last digit after deleting the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
She didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call?
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, give me the password, a pen, call, I'll give you the number.
Help each other.
Are men always like this?
You're just like him, a liar. I'll show you.
If you intervene again, I'll go to the minister's office.
She cursed me.
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is very brave.
She's out to ruin my career.
It's my mistake that I listened to you and called her.
Listen, Thursday!
She complained about me to the minister's office.
You're coming with me and telling the whole truth. Leave me out of this.
This is what has to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
He fled.
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
Just a one-hour meeting.
This is my mobile phone, not mine.
The war began.
Goodness, he's been sitting with you since that day.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his condition has not changed.
Jealous, he is jealous of women being around him.
This is not jealousy.
He is sitting alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Mother is dead.
That's why you invited me, so I could find a solution for myself.
She asked you to move to the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
See the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, excuse me, I've moved to the social welfare department.
Social Welfare Department! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you Mrs., sorry, Mr. Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Oh! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will be back in a month and a half.
This is a big problem.
If you want my opinion,
The minister is telling you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time he's letting you go because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
What are you doing!
You don't talk when your wife calls.
You never know, they might agree with you. Beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I had put them in the box for you.
How many?
I put ten because there are five of you in the office, which means two for each.
It seems he's very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave all of us male names.
He calls me Abdelkader.
What's his name?
He's funny and handsome, so she's afraid other women will like him.
In the name of God, what's in it?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
These abayas, each person can choose the one they like.
Look at this guy.
How much is this?
What's wrong with you? What happened?
Excuse me.
Where is the social welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I am crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
She opened the project in front of us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
"Illuminated, prepare some tea."
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, go prepare us some tea.
Come on, come on, nonsense.
Go, listen to what the man says.
Don't forget that we are the children of scorpions.
Come on, come on, bring me some tea without sugar, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The bank said the project is complete.
I called him many times, his phone was busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you for a while.
These are my brothers as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled for three months, and didn't come back.
Farewell, O Generous God.
And all changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yeah, but if you build a garden.
It will take up space equivalent to at least two or three villas.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it for yourself.
Put the tea down and leave.
There's nothing in the garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning to do, kill yourself?
Saw, I told you.
I advise you to forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessing.
Oh, Uncle Shahin is here.
Inshallah
Is this Thursday?
Old in age
Rashed became an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a deeply rooted family.
You know,
Leave the topic of marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Put it aside.
I have a few comments on his suggestions.
Present, may God prolong your life.
Anything else?
No, may God grant you a long life.
I take care of them and meet them when I have time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's the problem?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
Hanna is your older sister.
And we suffered at their hands.
Did you know they asked me about the game you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
This was just the beginning.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what this means?
This time we broke your face.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Auntie, let me slap her in the face.
That was enough.
Save it for next time.
You changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman can't work on the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You're going to embarrass us.
Let me break her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Sure, Scorpion Leader.
I just beat Fatima.
Let your brother have his chance, Falcon.
This is a flaw.
No problem, Darkenj. At least you got a slap in the face.
Show my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And write education instead.
Or even nursing, we have no objection.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Walk far away
Get us a copy of the request.
Go, leave.
Scorpion Leader! My son
The big scorpion is the one who suggested it to you.
Thank you, uncle, but when is the engagement?
Miss Munira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Abu Khalid
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How could they even allow you to work!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is nonsense.
No shame!
You should be grateful we let you go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and be silent.
Thursday, the son of scorpions
He is connected to us.
It's true that he's stupid and he doesn't have a degree.
It's just a scorpion.
What do you intend to do, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I'll call you when the sheikh arrives.
What a beautiful laugh!
Go get yourself some new clothes.
Go and bring me new ideas, boy!
I love this laughter
My brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
Lucky you, Oui! Aisha, you're the minister's friend now.
I'm afraid it's just a rumor! Oh, Abu Khalid!
Manira is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Are you going to work tomorrow?
We all need to cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Thank you.
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, brothers!
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
She is going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister is going to play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
She is going to study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
Seriously? Go make coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, kiss your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go, *
Oh stupid one.
The coffee in the pot you have has gone cold.
They don't call all year, but as soon as they know you have a show, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her you would be in the series with us.
Sure, and she'll be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaoula will play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is only for twenty-six or seven episodes.
Let Shula benefit.
He's going to give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid it's going to be a headache for us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the production company is actually yours, you and Hamed's.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here after
The director and actors are ready.
For the sake of time, let's start the meeting, folks.
Please tell us your opinion.
Hamed, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think she's the best.
You see why the maid committed suicide.
The most impactful part for me
It was after the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
She found him and wept over her son; the matter is very exciting.
And he continued kicking her until he reached the house yard.
Is it exciting?
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's really a very wonderful series.
I was almost done with the chain here on this table.
It's really an extortion of the artistic conscience.
My community
All of them are about extraordinary events.
This doesn't seem true.
Seventy-two murder cases.
What's with the crying?
You are known for obstructing people.
No problem, Professor Hamed, let's be open-minded.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, these things don't work with a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
There was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Madame Hessa?" I replied, "Yes."
I opened the bag.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, not by mistake.
She is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I've never dreamed of owning a ring like this.
May God bless you now, my dear.
Ah, that's it, I call it the "Series of Blessings"
Ali and Hamed own the production but they are employees there, they can't exhibit it under their names.
What more will we get than the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Would I be crazy if I did that?
Your genius husband
Who is called the magician?
Just five percent, that's all.
No, fine, they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will get 200,000 riyals, no problem.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada.
A great role, she fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The series we are going to produce is called "Blackmail of Conscience".
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf soap operas are always like this, the fashion this year is blackmail.
Alright, tell me, brave one, what's my role?
You're next, my dear, your turn is guaranteed.
Don't embarrass me.
I'm coming, I'm coming, now.
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect us.
He didn't ask to see me at this time of day.
He told him it was going to be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on him.
Okay, so what happened next?
God preserve me, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
It's a social series.
I just saw her on TV.
No, may God grant you a long life.
The series currently airing on television is called "Blackmailing a Young Flower."
Okay, I guess the budget they're asking for is really high.
Requires a high budget
Just don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need to support him.
Don't worry.
Have you read the art page?
We heard they're starting to film the series "Conscience Exortion."
And a huge budget was allocated to it.
However, it was said that the series was weak.
Another said that the series consisted of a school that taught debauchery.
They might stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello. Please sit down.
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
I am Eli Monir. I'm a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Oh, okay, please sit for a bit, because he's in a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will reach out to all the journalists in the world so they can communicate with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
And discusses his problems in a way that makes him one of the best productions in the history of the world.
Can you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a sense of ethics.
They work.
You think they're here for *
I met His Excellency the Minister. Do you know what he told me?
This is very tragic and its events are extraordinary.
The first episode is tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What's up, mom?
No problem, Mom, it's just the first episode.
I've seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series.
"After that, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your soap operas?"
Oh my son! Art is a matter of taste; it's not usual to generalize it to people and society.
Mom, this can be done in fine arts, but theater is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turkish people.
Don't judge yet, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our kids see this.
Not to that extent, brother.
There are worse shows on TV.
In fact, not everyone.
It's your fault.
For everyone, in every home.
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And find them.
Not ours
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How does the minister like it?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote this.
I only post messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish praise messages from me, and I will say that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You are happy.
For this year
Okay, if they have an agreement with him.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Alright, let's say they all have an agreement.
I'm reading the translation only.
I wish they would reboot the series Conscience Exortion.
Thank you, Minister of Culture, for this series.
I wish they would do it again.
When the minister's office called me for the first time
So we can come and get the last payment for the series.
They were right when they called you the magician.
That wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding, and we got our money.
And the serial is a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regretted writing it.
I'm here to propose a second season of the series.
The minister believed the press hoax I invented.
He believed in the illusory success we achieved.
He's not satisfied with the series.
This means that it is impossible for him to agree to the second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will request the second part.
I appreciate it.
Say "thank you"
For all people
Who worked on this series?
And we congratulate them on his success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards at distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
This is what you're thinking about.
You are a genius.
Surely you will win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said, "If readers and the press lie about me."
Yeah, why don't we make a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are arts washing.
Whitewashing art!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Illegal money
The series are the same.
What can't we do with "One Two"?
What do you mean?
Did we sign a contract with them? They need to be committed.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular, and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Did anyone tell you about his product?
Not exactly, they just told me it's bread, but I don't know what's in it.
It's bread with a zipper.
You call it a "susta."
Instead of cutting bread, call it "samoons" or "semolina bread," as you name it.
The inventor tried to make it easier.
Jean baked bread.
This is the secret.
You eat bread with a zipper.
These people do really strange things.
The zippers are terrible, they're made in such a way that as soon as you put them in your mouth, they instantly dissolve.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Go ahead, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We received it today, sir.
Say it! Forgive
We were with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
And we're still a man down, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans soon.
When you took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
The people who are important in the company.
Indispensable ones
He took the bakery at the hospital.
Why are you upsetting the man?
I said he can't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and laugh at himself.
He can do what he wants.
Just don't take the essentials.
What can I do, Mom? My team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, what's done is done.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I went with him.
The cat said "Meow".
And they left me standing in the goal area.
The match has started.
After that, I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me when I wasn't paying attention.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, Nasser!
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Fatih, he
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, Abu Nasser.
Listen to what he wants to say.
Present, just because you asked me.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow we'll have our last match in the tournament.
Don't make him angry, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, oh! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Zayn, Zayn, Zayn, Congratulations
Oh! Professor Nasser, I want to talk to you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Professor Nasser, we must
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Invite the press and journalists to come there.
No, Rashid! We'll keep it at our house.
So when my dad sees the players and their success, maybe he won't cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
Inshallah
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them, talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Keep it close to me.
Take a good screenshot.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's victory, the bakers, made them proud.
Very excited
And the effort
Loyalty to the bakery.
Sorry, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing with a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
God have mercy on you.
Goalkeeper
Journalists from Al-Dawly and Al-Jazeera are coming to interview you.
No, they're not council material.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Inshallah, your phone always rings, and your pictures are in the newspapers. You are blessed in this football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He said, "Lower the price of the engines."
Yeah, now you're famous, under every picture of you in the papers, they write: "The first player at International Bakeries."
Were you interested in soccer?
What do you say?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say I was never close to football.
Since the person next to me plays soccer, I'm close to soccer.
Being close to sports means I'm a sporty man.
So we've gone from international bakeries to international football.
I heard him say yesterday that he was going to turn it into a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete from the International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us your predictions before you go on stage.
The game is difficult today.
The team that will control the midfield today will be from *..*.
Yeah, God willing, we're reaching out to professional players' agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud, listen, we need commitment.
Ah, he wants the previous deal for the players.
It was of no use.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
Is the Gulf not part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
But you have to tell me once if a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a center player.
Look, these four players
Three of them cost.
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one bunch.
It will be six hundred thousand, I'll give them to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Okay, this is about African players, now, regarding the Brazilian player.
He is the player of the season, he alone is worth one million and twenty thousand dollars.
They quoted me this price but then later I received a fax, I'll show it to you, it's here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, check his calf.
How are you?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to get injured, God willing, no cruciate ligament tears.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this connecting muscle?
Butcher! Make a traditional dish of rice and meat.
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the shop, the shop.
God willing, you have another business.
No, no, no, just the players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the jungles of Africa.
Yeah, why like this?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being like any other.
The young boy said, "What did you hear?"
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, he will be beneficial to you later.
They are going up and down the field.
Come, come, come, come
Make it easy on him, he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach needs to understand.
We won 2-0, we controlled the game.
My father, he is Spain's coach.
What I love
Successful coach
The game needs to be controlled.
This is one, the opposite, the Wakrah road.
We need to let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to stop this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have activated the corner players and not attacked from the center.
Ah, he fell for the old bait and switch.
Oh, mom, don't give me a headache.
He needs to separate the kakono malawi.
And replace it with Shinamo Hababo Hitawala Hatawa Hawawa
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget Shlulo, granny Tabo's love.
What line?
Execute the plan.
And forget Hololo
This should be between the coach and the team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
Do you mean we're not football experts?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery van, let him go by taxi.
None of your business.
Stay informed.
See what my father did?
The coach was fired and rehired.
What's he doing?
The team is falling apart.
Our team said goodbye.
Mama Mama
No, he's crazy. That means he said you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this man.
I feel he can't handle the responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talking about the past.
You need to go to his father and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say! Oh, my brother Rashid.
Why did you divorce her then?
It's not fair, Abu Abdullah. We have the right to know, we need to know, why is she divorced?
Please, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
So you mean, I shouldn't interfere? The man is sitting in the living room waiting to find out why his daughter is divorced?
She knows how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not six.
This is Guardiola's team.
I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the living room.
If I go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
She has to leave and not shake her head.
It wasn't enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi will be better than him.
And your rude daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter is not a Barcelona fan and doesn't suit us.
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
He apologizes and pleases her.
Damn.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if we can't make our son happy?
Oh, stop it.
Above all, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not mad.
She's crazy! Boy, forget about her.
Drink your tea, boy!
You know, they're the ones who are losing out.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I pity her.
Poor thing, she got divorced just two days ago.
After a month of marriage.
What's wrong with you? Do you want me to interfere with him?
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
She knows who he is.
What else do you want!
Her wealth only.
Remember the building I want to buy and turn into a hotel apartment?
Those in Mansoura.
It belongs to his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If I can.
Spoke to her brother.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire!
Opportunity only comes once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
Okay, what about Barcelona?
Maybe the girl's family spread the rumor to prove that their daughter is innocent.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect this.
And we do not mock the group.
Let's assume this story is true.
God bless you, they used to call his father "Abu Burjeen" because he had two towers on the corniche.
Design them in an odd way, like twisted ropes.
When people see them from a distance, they think it's one tower.
What do you think? All the luck is with you.
Hello
God bless you. Go ahead, take something, anything.
Thank you, my love.
Just tell me, the light of my eyes, my son Abdullah, is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, my dear Um Abdullah.
If I travel to every Gulf country, I won't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
Are you done, Your Highness? Anything else?
Yeah, the family will call you.
"Figure out their needs for the wedding, prepare the check, and I'll sign it."
In the name of God, God willed, in the name of God, God willed, with your permission, Your Highness.
Abdullah got divorced again!
I wish for children from you and money from him.
God bless you, auntie!
Wear it to keep warm.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Where did you book us, Mama?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's the problem with Malaysia, then?
Have a safe trip.
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of someone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong with you? Girl, tell me?
Tell me what happened, girl!
Mom, she's so arrogant.
Why like this?
She's arrogant, forget about her.
I did the right thing when I fired her.
I pity her.
This is her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Done.
My mother says she booked us for the Maldives.
Okay, okay oh! The girl from the Maldives is also pretty.
And after you've unclogged the %pw.
I thought you'd come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why he took the children?
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, light of my eye?
Shut up! May God give you health, you're telling me about my son's face.
Oh! Boy! Why are you sad?
When I see the peels, I'll feel depressed.
May God kill the one who upsets you! O son.
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Shut up, and I know my son, anything small upsets him, why should he live miserably!
Oh! Boy, call her and divorce her.
May God curse her.
%pw Say it to her three times.
You're divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, you have two more chances.
Absolute, absolute.
Very tense.
Oh! Come on, boy! Oh! Dear, calm down and don't worry, there are plenty of girls, as they say. Come on, boy!
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
Who am I asking, Mother? He divorced me a long time ago. He told you, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you? He has no shame.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will you do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's going on! The world has turned upside down!
You see, I go to his house and despise him, and he doesn't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced from Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
As if you can taste the bitterness in your mouth right now because of your daughter, and you're feeling discouraged.
And they did nothing.
If she brings you the apple peeled, divorce her.
No problem if you want to release them as you please.
She is still married to a man.
Is this suitable for you? Let him go to hell!
And he felt the same thing he did to other people.
What you do not accept for yourselves.
Don't accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land this mall is on?
In a strategic location?
"Leave it to God."
And also at a low price.
Out of service.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to the library and didn't find it.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm off work and the problem is I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, I need it.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for him, may God protect you, is the office, not the house.
Do you eat, too?
What makes Abu Saqr rich?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd.
Do you know him?
As far as I know, I only see him on TV, and you told me that you met him during the pilgrimage to Mecca.
We don't know each other well.
Enough nonsense.
God guides you, you came straight away, at least ask about the reason for this holiday.
There's no occasion for this, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he holds fifty feasts.
I suggest, Your Highness, that they enter you in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the world's largest caterer.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It is an honour, Your Honour.
Up! Abu Flah
You say Abu Saqr throws a feast every day.
This is what we see.
Wow! Dinner tonight at Abu Fuleihah's for a special occasion.
Today, God protects you, your son Falcon.
God willing, he deserves your honor, with blessings.
He's here, hello boy!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Saqr needs to visit the agency tomorrow and take the car he wants.
I waited a year and a half for the approval.
I was out of work.
But when I got to him
And I give him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things don't work that way.
I told him "okay."
He needs to go to the showroom and take the car he likes.
We'll buy three for him.
Take it from him!
Take me to him.
You told me that you met him during the Umrah last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
He deserves to be well. Oh! Your Highness.
Shahin Oh! Abu Sakr.
God bless you, thank you all.
Praise be to God that Shaheen is fine, Your Honor.
God bless you
By the way, who are you?
Happiness of the judge
You didn't introduce yourself to me.
I can't lie to you.
My lord, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It's an honor to meet you.
So, Eagle, are you still hesitant about entering the field of trade, or haven't you decided yet?
I'm bored with him.
Why, son of Falcon, trade is beautiful.
You need to start, open an office, and then see.
Abu Sakr,
Please, say yes.
Why?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
And if business loves you and comes your way, you say no.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Since you got your license, everything has become easy for you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz was telling your father that if Saqr wants to join the business, he'll make him a partner with a 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mom, don't make me do something I don't like.
And you're lucky because agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
This is an opportunity, son. Who can start a project at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest in it.
Believe me, boy! This is your chance in life.
She quickly prepared lunch.
He also reached the pickles and pepper.
He left nothing, he left nothing, he's afraid he'll get the samosa franchise.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was excited to see. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
May Allah preserve him from jealous eyes.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son has just entered the world of trade."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a partner in two banks.
**T
I think, Allah knows best, they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, the one in the northern area of our office, what's happening with him?
No, I just love him.
Thank you, may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of hard work and struggle to get the supermarket ready.
What's the problem! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent his secretary, Summer, to me.
This is what Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, told me: he wants to be your partner instead of taking the shop from you.
Does he still want to be your partner?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
You started talking to him, right?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said business!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past that bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What was the name written on the sign?
It said "Neighborhood Bakery".
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
How's work with you?
May God bless you, Your Honor. God willing, we will finish the residential permits for the Future Company's workers tomorrow or the day after.
No, no, Professor Sakr, she is my wife, Elisa. Let me introduce you to Professor Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, someone said they want to work in business, they have some money and want to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, not even trade.
A person like this
Do you think he'll succeed? I don't think so, he's wasting his time and losing.
Did you hear? Oh! Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these parrots are saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
See it.
See him today.
Your Honor, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son, God willing, is a falcon, and I don't want to envy him; he is an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
I scared him, I have a falcon that builds itself.
He once gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
"Whatever God wills, see it now."
Oh! Falcon, we're talking about ordinary people.
One of them is a falcon, and that's what Abu Nasser did with it; he took it and put it on the road.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
Do we need to ask who his father is?
I swear I'm surprised.
"What Allah has willed" or "Praise be to Allah"
Gulf Money magazine in the economic referendum
Please.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong?
I swear, I don't know what to say, oh peace.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my parents.
And they said to him
Poor thing, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office and the fax was in his hand.
He did him a great favor.
As they say, I taught him how to shoot, and when he got strong, he started shooting at me.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, Salim.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
The man who gives to the poor without letting his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
I just want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we are now also supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of just one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
We'll come to you right away.
Who is this beloved one?
This is Khalid and his wife. They are staying at the hotel tonight.
Any place, any place, as long as we're together, I'm happy.
My love, (may God keep you for me) is an expression.
Ah! My love.
This isn't fair. This is my source of income.
This bakery
And take your money with interest.
A falafel for five riyals, hot bread for three riyals.
Two chickpeas.
50% full, okay, okay.
Cook six large beans!
Come on, divers!
The captain is here and brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Please, sir.
What's up?
No, no, what I'm asking you for is to hear a resounding yes in my ear.
Hello Nora.
Anoud is mad at you.
Can I bear your anger?
What's the problem?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a simple and plain dress.
Don't say Anoud will get upset.
Oh my God, these Lebanese speak so well.
And you don't need to talk to him much.
I too, I'm jealous of her.
The sweetest dress for the most beautiful Nouara.
He flirts with her and calls her "Noara."
How long does it take for your blood to boil?
I paid twenty thousand and have twenty thousand riyals left.
May God compensate you, congratulations!
God be with you.
Hello, O honor of Umm Saleh.
Hi Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
I am at your service.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I got it, you fool!
Did you like the joke?
Did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them. Show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
They're going to leave us, envy starts to work.
Only when he knew my project was good and started generating income,
They say he's going to do a project similar to mine.
Design and Sewing Boutique
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser; he has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He's going to hurt his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes, my cousin.
You know I was sleeping, and they suddenly woke me up and told me that your cousin wants to see you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
Inshallah.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like.
Are you looking for a partner or something?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I'd drop by.
You are most welcome.
If you need more, we have it.
Praise be to God, the work is going well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did.
Okay, God willing, goodbye.
So it is.
Are you sure?
With haute couture, you know the bigger disaster!
What is it?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) Oh, envious one! (Ad) Oh, hater!
Before you knew the market was open to everyone,
You need to know.
Your heart opens to your cousin.
I'm not asking you.
You deny, lie, and mock me and told me, I,
I wanted to do my work in secret.
You're getting it from the shop next door, you want to disrupt my work.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. By God, I'll slap you. This is hatred. Leave me alone.
Come on, you're relatives or what! People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, or I'll hit you! Oh! You're the one with the shrill voice.
I'll hit you just as you hit me with my bat.
Come on, guys!
Say, "Peace be upon you, O people."
I swear, I swear, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why specifically the Lebanese?
They chat with him, joke, laugh, and feel very comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese person.
He started saying nice words to me and trying to convince me.
He bewitched me, he bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
Earn money.
A Lebanese designer bag.
Can I meet with Mr.? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, is it still difficult today?
Yeah, today is still really tough.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong?
No, I don't know. What's the problem?
Abu Saleh is mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer who looks exactly like him.
For two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar. No Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project, opening the same shop right next to him. Can I go into his shop?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now and they're thinking of a solution.
What are you doing now?
We're sitting as if we had eaten poison.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even cover the rent of the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we're going to leave the field to them.
Okay, thank you. And what's the discount?
Impossible, why don't you give an evening dress for free with every wedding dress?
Impossible, let's go.
What's the problem? What happened? We're going to the store next to you; today they have an advertisement for every wedding dress, two evening dresses for free, and also a 25% discount.
Let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will announce the same advertisement, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses for free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I think the same thing, if we leave them, they will destroy us.
Don't worry.
What did he do next?
It's definitely a challenge.
Of course, this is a challenge.
Bravo, he deserves it. He's not kind; he doesn't want anyone to earn their living.
If it happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days. He'll close his shop.
Excellent work.
Wait, wait, lock, lock, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's the problem?
Saad says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit there, and he doesn't know where this bad smell is coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with the air conditioner, it's impossible.
Its smell won't go away from the shop for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He is cutting the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now, will you sign an undertaking or shall we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
He's ending his life.
Oh! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened; no one comes to our shop.
Abu Nasser, cut it, cut it, a customer is coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He's in bed, moaning.
He says it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and asked for the installments.
He was burdened with debts because of his despicable cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor things, if they accidentally enter and see Saad the designer, they scream at him and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never sleeps, his eyes are open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know how he did this to me.
Saud is at the shop.
He cast a spell on him, I don't know how he did it.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, how did he let it happen!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have many debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
I have no evidence against him, so I can't sue him.
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
Forget him, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you cast on him, turning his designer into a monster that women are afraid to see.
Spread a rumor.
Not good! Guys, tell him the shooting team needs him urgently.
Oh, everyone, God bless you, God protect you, tell him they urgently, urgently need him.
I swear, they're raising my blood pressure, killing me, paralyzing me. This isn't fair, Professor Abdullah.
No problem, dear Ahmed. Don't be upset. You have heart disease; this is not suitable for you, man!
I've called him several times, my heart hurts, but he's no good. These additions are driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'm going to give you a lot of talk.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed let's finish.
Therefore, I'll stop filming because the extra actor didn't show up.
What a production!
I have nothing to do with this! Professor Abdullah, why is he shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
The assistant is late and they are in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone with gravitas and authority who can convince people that he can actually become a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and take a seat. Your order will be ready in half an hour.
Not just anyone! Oh! Ala'a, not just anyone, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I can manage two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager, you are in charge.
What are they planning to do now?
They'll do everything, see the manager is nervous and the situation is chaotic, but they're handling it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find such a person now?
Are you serious?
Did you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, God help you, I hope he's suitable.
%PW Saudi Sea Cucumber!
Saoud Kanz! I remember him as Saoud Cow-horn.
Yeah, when he was young they called him Saud Shawk, and when he grew up they started calling him Kanz.
Why the cans?
I'll tell you why. Poor guy, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
Oh! My rich and honorable brother, no discouragement.
His appearance is suitable, as far as I remember, he is a bit stocky and chubby, neither tall nor fat.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do his makeup nicely, and I guarantee he'll still look cute.
Okay, what are you waiting for? Call him!
I don't have his number.
Take Amir with me and I'll go to him.
Where is Saud's house?
What's he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saudi cans
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kansa.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud, and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's right.
But this isn't Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop.
Exactly that, but it evolves over time because laptops are like cans.
He is tall, fat, and a bit tanned.
He canceled the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on Oh! Guys
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Am I confused? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where is the other jotara? Where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks Vaporub and Axe Brand.
Iron them a bit before you go out, because they're wrinkled.
But these days, I feel worse.
Mom, may God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting on taking you to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they said they're going to pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you're working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You argue with her, you get upset and go upstairs.
You're sitting and slowly, slowly moving, and the camera is with you, it will move next to you.
Yes. Jafar! Yes.
Whose laptop?
Any Aboud, this is a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Lamma.
This is for you, my son %pw, Aboud, how are you?
How are you, slave?
Behave well, you need to behave a little better in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, and I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
It's not like you think, brother.
He's very sick, you know she didn't sleep last night! Brother!
Asthma, my brother, may God heal you.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a bowl of cherries.
Oh! My lord, oh! My lord.
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He's a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he says, you have no point.
What's his mother's name?
She wants to spray you, what do you think?
I heard what she said about you.
She says you're being reckless, you need to be more serious.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million so he can fix the flat tires on my car.
And give him three million, he will bring me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm awake at the request of some people.
See Mr. Ghafel's production of our neighborhood, with high-level actors.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Okay, I'll help you, I have no sense, I don't, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your whole life is sweetness and comfort.
Take the man to the makeup room, put makeup on him, and tell Salamah to bring you the clothes and come to you.
Come on, come on, come on, this is nice.
Okay, okay.
Listen, brother, keep the car with us until we finish filming, I'll call you to pick it up.
Whatever, but can someone give me a ride?
I'll give you a lift! Okay, I'll ask our driver to give you a lift. Great, thank you, brother. Thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the extra person, call him.
Oh! People are calling for Saud's laptop from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth later.
It's already written in front of me.
Okay, let's review?
This means me!
I didn't expect this from you.
We'll fight, for what!
We'll fight for our rights.
Ah, wait.
You must know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Divorce her and be done with it.
And we don't marry off the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He's cleaning it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you're going to enter the fitting room to change your clothes, and we're ready for the shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Oh! Guys, the shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why like this?
I don't need tea! Brother, I'm bored and my stomach is full of tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how much longer do I have to wait?
"I didn't see anything, it's perfectly normal."
May God give you health and strength.
They are fast.
Thank you, Your Honor. May God preserve you.
Convey my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Present, Your Honor.
It was fun, wasn't it?
People like you, they greet you and still kiss your nose.
The first time someone kissed my nose.
How do they push them on their noses?
This is a problem.
My mustache is like an ice cream stick, it hurts your lips. That was funny, that was funny.
I didn't laugh!
You're welcome.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
My son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
May God bless you, Sheikh, may God bless you.
See her here or there by yourself, man.
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, my son.
Hello, how are you, Your Highness?
Vinegar, vinegar, vinegar, vinegar
Don't trouble yourself, God willing it will be, Dr. Hassan come here, come here.
Yes, oh! Dr. Hani, what happened?
Leave your honor at the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be fine.
Welcome, Your Highness, welcome.
Shut up or I'll hit you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, sir!
How are you, sir?
May God curse you.
Yes, Your Honor.
Welcome! Please, have a seat.
God bless you.
With such an ugly face (expression)
Go with him, Professor Rashid.
I swear, if I do something to you, tell me and you'll see what I'll do to him.
Oh! Buddy, can I find a doctor quickly please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Oh! Boy, quickly, I'm sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, taking your mother every week. You haven't found anyone there who isn't kind and accepting of anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
Enough, brother! She's ignoring me.
Okay, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intentions should be good.
There's nothing wrong.
Behave politely.
Get out, get out, if you don't leave, I'll call security so they can teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
Please, it's on me.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Falah Al-Marzook.
You're going to marry him means you're going to marry him.
No, no, I need the bisht, the clothes, and also the car, I'll rent it from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What a brilliant person Fahad Al-Marzouk is!
Welcome, welcome, it's a pleasure to have you.
The light of my eyes signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish I had come.
They were shocked by what I did for them; it was a very sophisticated and private party.
One regular and one diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom promised my friends tomorrow at work.
Are you going to get this for them!
Ah, what's wrong?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take this to his friends, for the scandal.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yeah, but I promised them now.
And I have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can get something that pleases people.
What's wrong with you! Let's go.
It has a good price and excellent quality.
Above average, not the best!
Of course there's premium chocolate, but I'm sorry, I thought you were looking for something more affordable.
This is way too expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive one?
This is unbelievable, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that they always order at the Spanish palace.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother. Give us some of that chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion for this, guys?
No, Saleh Abdulqader, the one in accounting.
By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me another one.
Quickly make some coffee.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, my love, I went to their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Believe it, my sister!
Did you listen to your aunts' words?
That's why I want to throw you an unparalleled wedding.
No time, you only have a month and a half.
I'll arrange everything.
He just doesn't let me do anything.
You're not living in the community; don't you see how people put everything they have into their weddings?
And you saw for yourself.
When you buy something nice, you'll see how they praise you and your taste.
They told you it was terrible and amazing?
Right, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
This means they will accept anything we choose.
Yes, your taste is really bad.
What's your opinion about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was nice!
What's your opinion on this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought of creating a theater like a computer mouse.
Excuse me for a minute.
Look, talk about everything except the stage and the arrangements. This is the place where women with nothing to do sit, except for gossiping, so just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We'll go to the mouse stage.
It's a very strange phase.
The latest model in 2011.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit on the side, it's all for your own good.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
We decided and we are ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think of yourself, getting married in the Comoros? That's how things work in our country.
And we're still just at the beginning.
If you don't have a platform, where do you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in reality, they are con artists.
What's wrong with you now?
Are you upset and annoyed?
If you want to get married, fine.
I'll call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh's circumstances are very difficult.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding expenses? It's fine, I don't have a problem. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you place them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure it's her first time in Doha?
And the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much more will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, then what?
Just Samir, I don't want to see this group in any wedding.
You know people's gossip.
Okay, they're reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
You're going to start a problem we can't handle.
God help you, Saleh.
Come on, you should have tried to sort things out.
For me, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say the wedding will cost you just two thousand dollars and you'll be happy.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You need to tell me how many cards you want.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, when and where, and that's it.
Just take care of him, don't worry about what people will say.
People gauge the level of a wedding from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the girls will say.
Look at their wedding, if these are their invitations, they haven't seen the invitations of so-and-so and such-and-such.
We didn't say that, we'll order it online.
It has a fabric cover, panda leather, and a silver sparkle.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be an exciting topic for girls, we're asking for invitations, we're asking for invitations!
I pity him, man!
Poor thing, of course his family pressured him a lot.
Dude! He's milking everyone for money.
What he said was, he even sold his car.
He looks like he's twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, poor thing, I don't know when we will develop.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the illness of appearances, boasting, and showing off.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Once, I gave a hint to the bride's mother.
I was attacked by her words (figuratively).
Keep your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married,
I'm thinking of marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says, "Your country!"
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
Just because Umm Nasser hired a famous singer for her son's wedding.
He's a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems like you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
A moment ago, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, Mom just stopped him.
I don't care about you or him.
I'm no less than anyone.
Don't make us a laughingstock.
Come on, Mom, enough. My brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
Please be quiet.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she shouted at him, saying he will cancel the wedding, and she doesn't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She's inside and they're giving her first aid.
He said she was much better now and they would find a room for her at the hospital.
Shame!
Rest, my sister.
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I rest when he wants to make a joke out of good and evil?
I was telling him to buy Abdullah Roaished, and he told me he didn't have any money.
I pity your mother.
He was afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her that I'll do what she wants.
I'll get you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not fair, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's up!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he is a senior man and, moreover, he is disciplined and honest.
Want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is because of the damn crisis she's going through, and she wants to ask Abu Youssef for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
Only God knows when you will return it to Him.
And when the people came to him asking about the money,
Of course, there might be a problem.
No one will know, and he will know how to handle the matter.
It's up to you, the man is in his office and you have to be responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
My uncle doesn't call it theft.
On the first floor.
In it, there is a white box wrapped in blue ribbon with a circle containing a picture of a dove's wing, bring it, bring it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me, if I don't have any problems,
Pay them all.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
I came in the last of my days.
Corrupt me, Thursday.
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying. If it was someone else, they would have been beaten or something bad would have happened to them! Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
Every way I've tried hasn't worked, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm stuck.
I can't back out of the marriage.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the second one, the scary one, the scary one.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of tablets, which one do you need?
The box with the picture of a scared man on it.
We booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Al-Rowaished and his band.
You'll see, dear.
No, I won't tell you.
Will the will be the hit of the season.
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mom, mom,
Goodbye.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the Mu'awwadhats when you enter the hall.
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you before, it's terrible.
The best groom ever, may God protect you, I don't want to be jealous of you.
Mama, mama, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people who came for the trial,
And now I've solved it, I'm going to be locked up, oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
This isn't fair if that happens!
The company offered a contract worth three million, and two million was just for the materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there's corruption, but it doesn't reach this extent.
It seems like you're not living in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
Why didn't our manager object? They say he was with him!
As far as I know, I really don't know.
Where is the morality?
What is right has become wrong, and what is wrong has become right!
Oh! Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Oh! Goodness, what's happening in the world?
I just fired him!
What next?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
That girl is involved with the minister.
What a strange world (expression)
What's wrong with you guys, didn't you know who she was?
This is the new employee that the minister hired to replace Osman, who wasn't lucky.
Come on, come on, come on.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Protest against the minister!
Are you crazy!
Listen to me, men.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here he is, standing next to the elevator.
This is the reward for loyalty and honesty, my brother Saleh.
I wish we could do anything for you, my brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
It's one of those strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things that are unbelievable.
I'm at your service.
I want to stop by the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try. Goodbye, then.
Who will take my sister home?
It's an old rule that laughs and talks, who is it?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he takes me home? There's no problem.
Oh my God, I can't believe it, why do you look so outdated!
What do you say?
What do you hear us say?
You're old-fashioned.
This is old and new about right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we are living in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that unite the world and no one can keep up with them.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Manira; it's against my nature to be tense and angry.
This is one of the things he sees in his day.
Tell her he's sorry.
Life doesn't go the right way.
Don't be sad, come and eat lunch.
Let me sleep so I can rest.
The president is not angry with you.
Is the president not angry?
No, he's not upset, go wash your face and eat your lunch.
Present, my dear.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
It is an honour, Your Honour.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the work principles.
Yet, at the same time, this is very important.
To recover some values and principles that work.
In the public interest.
This should be your honor.
We all have to.
Division is very important, Your Honor.
They are thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
And what else do I want to say?
And I warn you from my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
Who is sincere, loyal, and dedicated, and who is like these bad things?
Just doubt.
He is a devoted employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, things will be as Your Highness wishes.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As Your Highness pleases, I'll say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you were highly praised, God bless you.
Present, Your Honor.
Ah! Smoke, you know how to choose.
God guide you, if He wills.
Why did you let the devil control you?
You should thank God it was only about honesty.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Shut up, girl.
No, no, I won't do it again ever.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Stop her.
This means he became honest.
It's unfortunate to say that your father is telling the truth.
Is this the outfit!
Your whole body is covered.
What do people see?
And God willing, you are looking for a job, no one will hire you in this condition.
Is there a respectable girl who covers her body and beauty?
She covers her chest, wearing it up to here, and she's choking herself.
I'm tired of her, boy.
And I bought her a top and pants that showed her midriff above her navel.
It's a hopeless case, she doesn't want to follow the right path.
Here I am telling you!
You'll only blame yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us these days is just looking for the right man for his daughter.
Let me tell you, Rashid, my son.
He is a very good man.
He never stops drinking.
He's been drunk for twenty-four hours.
Drunk, tipsy, and hungover all day.
Don't ask about the noise.
He has had a good upbringing.
And let me tell you, he's also a hypocrite.
How's the theft?
This is what I expect from you. How are the medications?
Clear, he's done. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupils, I'll make a contest out of it.
By the way, Abu Sara, we're just here to ask for her hand.
You know how to socialize and hang out with friends.
We know she came from a good family.
"By God's blessing, son, by God's blessing, this is life, by God's blessing."
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Okay, come.
Okay, goodbye.
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, standing with his wife and a blonde girl.
Frankly, your father is always on the go, he's enjoying himself.
Hello my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's right.
You're confusing me, my daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in the year two thousand and ninety, after signing a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest to be raised was by the Israelis and their Arab friends of accusations against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second article, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Let's move on to the crucial meeting now.
Mr. Cheap
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Oh man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please!
Pardon me, Mr. Tiger, pardon me, Mr. Chairman.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find something stable, a stone or plastic as a commitment.
Oh man, even our houses.
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, they are all made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very important point, and I would like to vote on it because growing nails is a violation of the agreement.
If agreed, raise your hand.
I just had a very strange dream.
So you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you'll start working on tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The children follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times has he come to me without a shirt?
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to hurt him.
The children throw chalk at him.
They're pulling his goiter in the break room in front of everyone.
They said this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
Come and sit down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop her.
By the way, the school principal you're going to start working with tomorrow called me.
However, no problem, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting, I'm telling you.
The age of kindness and weakness is over.
Ah! My cousin, ah! Abdullah.
You'll see Rashid differently.
There is no need to remind you of the important educational quote.
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the son of the first grade.
You will meet Mr. Rashid the powerful.
And if anyone makes a mistake,
There will be a problem.
When you start talking, he said, just be quiet.
I'll see what I can say to him.
Who among you laughed at me and said, "Just be quiet"? Who?
You're the one who told me to just shut up!
No, not me.
The person next to you, is you!
Stop, and go to the manager.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
You don't just have to be like this on your first day, you have to be like this all year round.
Be mindful of the consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
I explain or speak.
You know what that means.
It means tense, do you know what tense means?
Means tense.
Did you hear what I said or not?
His reputation is yet to come.
Get out of the class.
Go to the manager.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Take your stuff.
I don't care.
It's clear he's still looking for him.
No, sir, we didn't see it.
By the way, ice cream with milk is really good if it has strawberries inside.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and so does man.
I'm just messing with you, kid.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
What I want is the chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I'm at your service.
He says he's pleased with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a regular kid.
Misfortune, how does misfortune appear? Green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one potato.
I took it before them all, I bothered them. My friend Abdelrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation CD from him.
What can we learn from this story?
That man
He must have morals.
This is for the PlayStation, he told me to get the whole PlayStation at once.
Okay, do you want something else, my friend Abdurrahman?
There's nothing now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
I thought I should submit the event file before I travel.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdurrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything to him, praise be to God, I'm safe and relieved.
Let's say I took it this afternoon and he got upset and told his father, "No, no, no, this is a disaster, no, no."
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman.
God help you.
What are you doing, this is an order.
Do you love him, love him this way?
Today, children, we're going to have a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Thank you.
I need water.
Whatever you ask, whatever you ask for, I am at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Does a professor call a student "my dear," as if the student is his servant? This incident will not be overlooked; I will write it up in the report.
And you still mock, you mock me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, you hear me, right?
Is this enough for you?
Okay, how many cars is this for?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he's going to park in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Fine, I broke the table.
Don't get tense, brother!
Why like this?
Are you different? (Expression)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything! Brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you! Brother?
What do you mean when you say "There's no need" and "I want to make things easier for you"?
What do you say?
Pedal, what do they call it?
It seems like you want the...
You want this, take it easy.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
It's not fair, it's not what he wants!
He's not the boss of this neighborhood.
We're here at Uncle Abu Naif's to discuss, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid to do what he wants in the neighborhood?
Have you given me the chance to speak?
Alright! Everyone, be quiet and listen to what Uncle Abu Naif is saying.
Now, this worthless loser is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I don't slap him in the face, he won't keep his word.
The game is played by its players (metaphorically).
Is this okay?
Goodbye.
I haven't seen anything yet.
You know he owns a jewelry store now!
That's why I see him wearing all these rings and necklaces here.
God will compensate us.
Just walk, you intend to stay in the heat?
I can't believe that Rashid, the simple and poor man, has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You're both teachers, but look where he is now and where you are now.
You're welcome.
Don't thank me, Abdullah.
I'll tell you the secret.
The teacher has come, the teacher has come.
Professor, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Yes, my love, I know who he is.
I'm telling you, we're not going to get a better opportunity like this.
I'm looking for a job! That's funny, really funny.
No, brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Convey my regards to him.
Your mother sends you her greetings. May God protect you, I will tell her, he sends his greetings.
Okay, goodbye dear, in God's care.
What more do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, just believe it, son!
Oh! Mom, we're working, we're working at a high level.
Come on, son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He just gives it to you like that.
Everything is fine, right?
Alright! This is automatic, without any doubt.
My love, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is upset.
This shows, oh! My brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
He actually stood up, took the mobile phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm a million percent sure Abu Sultan holds a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Seriously, to that extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he is working on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh! My son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the country.
I just can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women are starting to talk about the subject, and don't mention Latifa, the dish collector, she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I'm going to faint.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
Mind your own business.
Manira, I'm working on a low flame.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my mind.
I deserve to be a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
So they can make them fire him.
Yes, plan.
He should have trusted me from the beginning.
They told me we appoint him as a minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I'm very sure he's going to get fired from his job.
Magic may be undone.
What is it?
What's this again?
At every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him until his photo becomes widely spread in the newspaper.
He farts until he floats to the surface.
Are you sure?
Wait just a minute. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor.
Of course, Your Highness.
So tell me,
Did you thank him for the sheep? By the way, the meat tasted really delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be stupid, people want to elevate you and you want to degrade yourself.
Only the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take a picture of me, no. Just His Excellency the Minister, a picture of Your Excellency.
Take one more.
Oh! Brother, I really like your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he has one too.
Okay, I'm telling you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say, "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist, okay, okay, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is everywhere (expression)
They envy you, they are jealous of you. But it's only the fruitful tree that is pelted with stones. (Proverb)
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For this famous person,
Are you home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today. My head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is making it worse.
I'm tired, really tired. It's been a month and I'm still with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
May I say something?
Oh! Woman, I just want him to take me.
You started to love him.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is worried, and it seems he loves this story.
My brother Saad sent you.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wills the destruction of an ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, men, do you have a conference here in the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
No thanks, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Can I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Come on, come on, come on, and take your time. Come on, ask, come on.
God helps everyone.
Does this minister let us sleep or rest?
This means he couldn't find a party, a wedding, or any problem to throw him into.
He went to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and didn't find anything. His luck is as miserable as his face.
Just shut up, okay.
I didn't find his birthday, nor...
Come on, you might make it for the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired! Oh, brother.
Man, the newspaper editor says the first thing is to prepare his picture, then prepare the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a competition based on a picture of your husband, the minister.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner takes the prize.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the cafe and listen to the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. It's all just endless gossip.
Wow, his death is very near.
As they say, when a butterfly is destined to die, it approaches the light.
People are leaving you and greeting him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't thank me. Who is he?
You ruined my reputation.
God bless you and bless her.
She said that all of us got married except poor Amal; she's the only one among us who didn't get married.
This is my fate.
I can't get married.
And I'm forgetting about marriage.
God alone is sufficient for whoever is behind this.
Do you see those spoiled brats sitting over there?
Ah, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father passed away, it means I killed him.
You saw it, it grew, right?
It's not right to leave it up to the maid.
Go and make tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. She doesn't have just one maid, she has two for herself.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere, Khalid is my son, not yours.
You only have the problem of Khadoud, the maids, the maids, and Khadoud.
Mom, this isn't good. Khulood is with the maid 24/7 and doesn't want anyone else.
Leave. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my dad about you.
Let me tell you something, what's the problem with Khulood?
Saoud says that Khulood wears makeup and acts like girls. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Goodness gracious! Oh, Saud.
Khulood put makeup on his face! Just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small point, so faint as to be hardly visible.
He is kind, gentle, and affectionate.
I'm sad about Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to become when you grow up, and you didn't tell me. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to become?
And you, my dear Kholodi, my dear Saad is going to be an office, and what do you want to become?
This year we're going to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the vibrator in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susn, Khulud, and Fahad.
And say hello to Samoura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today my father told me to choose.
Do you want to buy the land overlooking the sea or the land nearby?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow! Oh! I hope I can open my eyes and be told that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
And if God wills, will you speak to people this way outside?
How true! Oh! Khalid.
Please get out of my room!
Oh, what a pity, Khulud!
You disappointed me.
Come on, don't make me angry, I'll tell my mom for sure.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Poor thing! Khalid is the light of my eyes, I wish all children had his kindness and feelings.
And when you see someone kind and quiet, you say they are like me.
Shame on you, it's wrong of you to say such things about your brother.
Stop, you're making a big fuss over nothing.
Poor thing, he just wears really nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
I'm telling you, don't say that in front of your father.
I have it.
Show it to him, but stay calm so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How do these girls meet?
It's bad for a beautiful girl to do this!
Don't read it, don't read it!
I'm afraid he felt there was something that concerned him.
Save your breath.
I know you're following the Bluetooth trend these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Would you like something to drink?
I've seen her sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He's afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
I seek refuge from the devil, my son! For my sake!
I have already booked.
I'm going far away. How can I face people? I can't!
What should I tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, those kids, they only bring trouble, oh.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Of course, this will be the result.
Stop, please get out.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is off for a while.
And you're blaming me, Amal?
You are a girl and you spend all day at home.
What should I say when I'm a man who spends all day meeting people outside?
Difficult, O Amal.
I can't live while I spend my day, my life, and my head always looking down.
The father feels for a while that something is wrong in the house and that there is a change.
How much longer will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame Dad and sometimes I don't.
How can I blame him, Amal! When I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves the house, the responsibility for the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to dredge up the past right now.
Does my father know about the subject or not?
But I'm ready.
Turn on the Bluetooth for him.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my parents' eyes.
I'll be really crushed.
Woe to you, Amal,
He knows how to throw at us.
I know much better than someone else.
What a pity our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb named Khadija exploded in it.
And customs and traditions.
You'll find them impudently.
They stop their ears from it.
They don't want to hear it.
They hear only one voice.
Which is dirt and estrangement.
They trample on all the good.
What comes to your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, God help you, my son.
God help you.
It's the people who are coming back who bring gifts, not the people who are going on a trip.
You're right.
This is a rule.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did he see her, girl?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Daddy, what's wrong, Daddy?
Daddy!
Don't be sad.
You are a great person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because there's something wrong with you.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept my children's uncle.
I'm like your brother.
"So, be patient."
You're here every day.
Before you come at all,
I was hidden underground.
This was before we were underground.
These are very strong words, can you handle such words?
You get a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say "Mashallah."
Come on, come on.
You've only been here for seven months, keep quiet and give me a ride home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is laughing at you.
I came less than seven months ago.
He bothered me, my son, he bothered me.
Send him back so we can get rid of him.
I want another one!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know how much time and money it costs.
Driving lessons. Return it and let's get rid of it!
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago.
Okay, I'll tell you something new later.
Gas is now $1.14, before it was 50 cents to a dollar a gallon, everything is expensive now, boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
When I came here for the first time, what was the salary I gave you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've only been here for six months and this salary of eight hundred is a lot.
I need money.
The driver you're talking about is ahead, way ahead, and you're new.
These seven hundred have now become eight hundred.
Come on!
He said, "I'll give you an extra 100 riyals."
And there is no benefit in three hundred.
What I told you is the right thing?
No, no screen. It'll cause me problems if I escape.
No, I'm afraid, O Screen.
Those who flee from their shepherds.
Why are you afraid?
Because before these people were shepherds.
Give them a salary of six hundred to seven hundred. Do you know how much they take?
How much is your salary?
Why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
God is sufficient.
I woke up Nassoer and told him to go see it.
There was no one.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have you done!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and kept it.
You can go! Sir, you are excused.
We're looking for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They got us into trouble and harmed us.
I told you to send it back.
Do you think I'll leave him?
Find him no matter what.
He will come back, meaning he will come back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him back home than let him stay here and make money.
I've come this far, I hope to find him.
The man is entering now, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous because I noticed.
But what are we afraid of? We were afraid our team wouldn't score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared, you were terrified of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Great! The foxes have scored a goal, you're ahead by one goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, men.
Why try? You can't beat our team!
Your Honor, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "This has many problems."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up for the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend, Sajid!
Take it, Pasha!
What did he do to himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Yeah, he's football mad.
Don't say that about my team, the Foxes.
They're going to win, they're going to win.
Come on, Sajeed! Hurry up, the match is starting soon. Take water with you, the foxes are playing today.
Dear viewers, we have with us today one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, named Tha'loob.
They say you beat them because they were missing players.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's missing? Each team has twelve players.
Whether one or two are not there, it won't make a difference.
This fox is very clever.
This is the best fan we have.
Well, on the occasion of Oh! Fox's victory, any last words you'd like to say to the foxes?
All words stopped,
When they say the name of foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This fan is decorative.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Come on, let's go! Handsome.
Where is the Indian man who loves football?
I haven't seen him for a while.
Oh man! He's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in Villaggio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the cafe and he didn't have money for a cup of tea.
He tipped the boy twenty riyals in front of me.
What made him become like this?
Oh! [The man], sitting with the top executives in the club, helping him and doing everything he wants.
Can I say something, Fox?
Yes, uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a weak and bad club.
The Fox Team is my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
I haven't heard the poem, Your Highness, that was written about governance.
When we had a match against them.
Please, please! Fox, read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. Oh God, who knows my secret.
My soul hurts a lot.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're the Fox Fan Club.
Can you tell me the winner's name so I can have an exclusive scoop?
We will hold a press conference, God willing, and announce the name of the winner.
Who spends.
The famous Fox, this fan who was honored today by the Fox Club's management with a kind, rare, and truly amazing gesture.
Seriously!
Congratulations, Tha'lab, on this beautiful honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is a move.
I'm telling you, it's him.
We must inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All the fans, every single one of them, all the fans.
No, no, no! Oh, boy, that's not him, it's just someone who looks like him.
I'm telling you, that's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the game times, brother.
Now how can we catch him?
But we have to wait until the Foxes play their next match.
Here he is, here he is, I see him.
Alright, let's follow him.
Oh! My brother, you're late.
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Go after him, follow him, follow him, go after him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's him or not.
I'm telling you, Dad, this is it.
I say the truth and wisdom that we go to them and ask them and tell them, the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Dad, you always complicate things.
We're reporting him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, God bless it. Yes, it's mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
And also the second earth next to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman al-Subji sends his regards. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken. Oh, boy! We came to a friend thinking you were him.
God Almighty creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Highness, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Present, if you please. Sorry, I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God bless you, goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I have no idea what your father is going to do! I'm really worried.
What have you done, Waleed!
Why, why, why when I was walking, the bag strap got caught.
And try to solve things now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father finds out?
Shattered into a million pieces.
Okay, mom, let's buy something similar as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mother.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He didn't do anything.
By accident, he hit the vase with his bag and it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter?
You scared him and made him terrified. Do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, girl?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he comes, I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Walid is.
Come with me, I'll take you to his place.
Let's go. Come on.
Here he is.
Come on, grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me in your house.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear, that's all I know.
How can your father, may God guide him, scare you like that.
Come with me, boy!
Don't be alarmed, boy, as long as I'm in the house, don't worry, boy!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid!
Please, I beg you, Abu Walid.
This time, I'll forgive him for you.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, my son. Oh! Waleed, your father isn't going to do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes oh! Boy, yes.
Are you going to leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids will hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me, "You need to bring me one like the one you brought him, but his hand broke it."
He wants exactly the same thing. I went and couldn't find anything but this, the last one in the shop. He's so lucky. Where are the kids?
In the room, he studies.
Alright, take care of him.
Just this game and I'll stop.
Oh, wow!
Okay, then study!
Dad, just this game and then we'll study.
Please, Dad, don't tell Uncle.
Daddy, don't tell your brother. Daddy, this is the last time, I swear.
I'll call him.
And you, in particular. You insulted me, your friend at the café?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't!
Alright, I won't call. This phone is in my pocket, so if you need it for studying, that's fine.
Daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
God guide you, mother.
He scares him to death because he hits him all the time.
Poor boy.
Wait.
Mom, where is Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
She goes with her.
My sister doesn't accept wearing abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
She has a baby, may God bless him.
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef...
I learned about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and was shouting at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He needs to take his father and tie him up in the middle of the backyard.
And then he told him to do it again and pee in your bed.
There's a big fuss over nothing.
What did you say, Umm Munira?
I was telling her everything, everything.
Eat and enjoy.
Oh, I'm so unlucky.
Mama, Mama.
Thank God your father didn't find out about you.
Or he will beat you to death.
Okay, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up because he will cause you a big problem.
I won't listen to your talk.
Poor things, they have to...
They cry and tremble.
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle so he can punish them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
Frankly, I agree with his point of view.
Forget feelings.
And my brother must punish them.
Okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get a perfect score?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I've warned you, but you don't listen to me.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
Rude boy!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Hey! Stop, bro.
So next time, review well, review!
Okay, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
It makes you jump one after the other and become falafel.
Stay vigilant when you go to public places with your family.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You should be happy.
Oh boy, everyone has left and even the buses are gone. You're just waiting for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance means he's waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, Walid! Come back.
Hello and welcome, live, to our new episode of the program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran together possess 686 billion barrels.
Iran followed with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and then Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each of them then comes to Venezuela at a rate of seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities related to oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite its prices soaring astronomically
Similarly, the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What appears later on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
And what are the producing countries?
The day that determines the price is market strength.
No, not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a role.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
stock market and other markets
And moved on to prices in speculation.
"Commodities" like oil, for example
And tomorrow you will receive one thousand dollars, God willing.
In 2004, oil jumped from $44 to $147.
And today we see even the prices of gasoline.
He changes from day to day.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
"Always, to the second quarter"
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, the temperature drops below ninety.
All of this indicates that speculation has power and control over the market now.
He changed a lot when we returned to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection to the so-called expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
It could affect the oil market either negatively or positively in a rapid way.
The impact is certain and will have its effect.
Even speculators are affected by political factors.
This could confirm, he says, some say to you that the American war on Iran is coming.
What's happening here in the market? The market is optimistic in a certain way.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in the light of what the White House
And this returned the region to a tense atmosphere.
This is the mystery.
But maybe Fallon saw this scenario.
He has a quick glance at the oil market.
Today we are, and we have proven with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased to more than half of what they were in the past five years.
Today, no, I mean, I want to say...
Not even for the next war, because today I tell you that even the world has profitable storage.
Even today, in any country you choose, you'll find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks caused by this problem?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred or maybe three hundred dollars, it could be less though.
You might succeed if these tensions become real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing nations.
You'll see how the effect backfires on the oil market.
Up to three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other things to the oil market. Today you will see more than two trillion dollars or trillions of dollars.
Today we see printing.
Speculation is more than a hundred a day - meaning -
These tensions in the region and the anticipation of
April, as has been said before, will be the month to decide this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, the Chinese.
In the area because now
This year is an election year.
And the current American administration only has a few months left.
George H.W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not expect events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America won't pay anything; you, along with Iran and consumer countries, will pay.
America Today
Now it depends on African oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, no, let's talk clearly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent
From oil reserves
But now they release twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a constant number and constant reserves and reserves.
So-called deep-water production or deep-sea mining from the deep ocean
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
Caspian Sea oil
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They are ruining and destroying it.
The important thing is that there is...
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is why these countries are considered a tough number.
And the energy needs of states
It certainly means there's something called secure provisioning.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
About President Bush who could
Try to notice how political risks don't come from the Gulf states.
It means no, no, no, the matter is not about generosity because none of us deals with generosity.
No, there is a lot of generosity in the treatment.
But not "in the current domain"
We're not part of a charity.
Or be generous.
But Karim is generous with Westerners, not with anyone else.
With America precisely.
Where is the market?
Where we find economic habits, we go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
You're doing it out of kindness.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
It's the rise in prices.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are primarily as a Gulf nation and an OPEC member.
Exports must be in dollars, and you refuse.
He changed the currency despite the currency collapse.
Even though the odds aren't in your favor
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's not the experts' true words.
Well, the dollar has fallen by thirty percent and oil has risen more than this decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course, this means
That oil has increased in price.
It's just a small increase, esteemed deputy.
That means if we take it.
We consider him now.
Even these prices
I mean if we compare it to two thousand and four.
It even exceeded the rate of decline of the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
React to the dollar's depreciation.
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market started giving him a sense of.
Our concern now is reduction.
No, the situation has changed. Maybe at the beginning of the reduction two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and has become...
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
So the question is, why peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historical period.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
He says that America in the mid-seventies
The gold standard that was backing the US dollar was abolished.
This is not correct.
Okay, tell me what's correct.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the world market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Those who deal in dollars for oil pricing.
If you set a price in another currency, everything will be lost.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries need to agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are very good at this.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
The reserves, but I see them as exports.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all those countries organized under OPEC.
Her share in the market does not exceed forty percent.
Made and exported outside OPEC
This can be associated with forty percent.
He can't do it alone unless...
Some countries have only experimented.
Not a real attempt.
You're the one who's refusing because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
It's a pity if they import it.
And his currency rose very high.
And he sells his oil in dollars.
In his entrance or reception area, he received it, received his money in dollars then converted it to his local currency.
My salary is not linked to the dollar.
True, but he...
But this is also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency is not pegged to the dollar, then you have an issue.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid the devaluation of the dollar?
He has been tied for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had great purchasing power.
This separation is not that easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, it's not like that here.
Divorce has its costs.
This works in favor of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, Qatar being one of them.
But there is also a report on Gulf financing saying that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman left the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement on Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been dismissed.
He said yes and that there would be a study, but all Gulf countries must also be involved.
Profit and loss must be examined very carefully without emotions.
Leave the matter for inspection until they come.
Look, I can get you other economists who can conduct another study.
This contradicts this study.
Global House said something very simple and organized, and it was issued in a report dated March 8.
Just four days ago.
The global home identity is the simple solution and requires a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
Her intention or the five with Kuwait, regarding her intention in 2010 to issue the currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a resolution to eliminate the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
For the Gulf Unified Currency
This currency will be strong.
Bacon
It could be one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
What will come from the reserves and huge revenues?
That's why the Prime Minister emphasized this when he spoke.
Gulf countries because no single country can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content
And today, we see economic growth even up to the euro.
Of course, don't forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In the evaluation
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all these news
Tense situation
In 2008, as observers noted, the World Bank stated that this inflation would persist.
For a long time in Gulf countries, but the solution lies with the governments.
Some countries have increased salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflationary process that
And here's my question now, when will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short ad.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, Saudi Arabia
He has 264 billion in reserves.
And two of every ten barrels.
Nine out of ten are produced daily.
One million, Kuwait one hundred and one and a half, production one billion, production two point seven million.
Qatar, with a population of fifteen and a half billion, produces 850,000 tons of oil. Oman, with a population of five and a half billion, produces 707,000 tons.
Bahrain, with a population of 1.25 million, produces 35,000.
The total revenue was thirty-three billion per year.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the total GDP of the GCC countries in 2006 was $717 billion.
The total in 2007 is expected to be 79.97 billion.
It was in two thousand and nine hundred and twelve and one-tenth billion.
While the continuous inflation devours the salaries of employees and people working in this area.
But it will rise to eight and three tenths by 2008.
Kuwait represents fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine tenths of the Emirates.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six thirty and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eroded.
What are the amounts and percentages you will give to the poor people here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries always increase. Salaries always increase.
What's the solution?
I'm not against raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true
We always
Of course, there is faith.
In the event of an increase, an increase without control of inflation will cause inflation to eat up all these increases.
To tackle inflation, a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists is required.
And now this committee is forming.
Because salary increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics says
It never ends.
And whatever it is
Substantial salary increases, no matter how much they are.
Inflation is going to increase.
The solution is necessary and essential.
With a scientific study here at Bait.com, the specialized recruitment institute, conducted a study with the help of the British Yougov Siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and those with jobs, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
You're thinking of moving from these countries where inflation continuously eats away at you.
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, and you break down the simple concept and try to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
He is there.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem; instead, they make it worse.
"يزيد يعني" translates to "It means increase" or "It means to increase."
We hope to have more time for this committee to develop.
All requests
This is boredom, Your Highness.
Boredom always exists.
True, but the state tried and dealt with the increases of forty percent.
No, there's an important point about raises here.
Regarding increases, you only want them for Qataris, as if non-Qataris working in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe don't matter.
You take into account Qataris and you don't take into account non-expatriates.
While the higher proportion in it
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about it and suffering.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw.
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector has become...
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read the report, as you know, we are in the oil field.
Work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
Because we also deal with the global market.
For all these things, what is the average salary increase?
Hope is with God Almighty, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
I'm a temporary solution.
"And we'll see, I'm sure."
It will be there.
Positive results
It will be around fifteen percent.
Well, the second good report says that twenty-two billion barrels of oil and thirty billion cubic meters of gas are coming your way.
I have no comment; this isn't the spraying process.
The procedure, of course, we...
But talking about economic growth should also reflect on people.
And contrary to any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
The reverse is also true.
The country's giant "carriers" are also part of it.
Even if these weren't the massive "carriers" and big projects.
In this country, it won't be part of the inflation yet.
Led to some inflation
This also led to a lot of liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil for protection
I am from the United States of America, thus the stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Frankly, it's a nice episode and the title is good.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
American policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar the inevitable currency for the whole world.
Brother, I say buy now.
And the Gulf region will become
As a place
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Waseef from Egypt
Hello to the happy deputy with you.
Oh happiness of the Arab rulers in the Middle East, you remind me of
When there is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjusting salaries in returns according to prices as you said, Your Highness.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
And he continued not to promise an increase, which is a very Arab style.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Turka.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Of course, it's his right; he's responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Highness must take into consideration.
This is the second time he has to respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are people from countries that need special care.
Arab leaders don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to him.
I want more.
Salaries are excellent and good, that's great.
Well, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor, and always by the will of God, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are certain.
And the judge said that Qatar is as he said, the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's respond to the brothers first.
I can't judge.
What happens to the wealth?
Now there are almost new cities like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning Qatar is also expanding.
This is not the case. The case is this.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we still have two minutes, tell us what you will choose Qatar.
Qatar now, there is Qatar after oil and gas.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because it is he.
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
That's why today the trend is in Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city houses some of the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
Of course not, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
It's not just Al Jazeera, it creates a hundred Al Jazeeras, and of course we don't stand with Al Jazeera.
Because these countries are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, the boom, now everyone remembers the boom in the 1970s.
Now let's see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This requires a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
Our vision for oil and its future and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Direct greetings this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time that Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special contacts with the Qatari leadership.
The Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006
And there is still unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia about two years ago.
Clashes with the regime in Egypt at the same time
Like the Lebanese file where it succeeded when others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Also difficult files
The one who cares should be the engine for these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We try to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
And for whom is the benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and demographically, plays these big roles.
What qualifications do you have that enable you to do that?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister of Qatar and the Foreign Minister.
For viewers who want to participate, they can call us on the program's numbers that will appear on the screen in a moment.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's guns roar for better relations with Saudi Arabia
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to control the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murra tribe.
In its version published last June 20th
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not
What I think is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I always said that the correct thing is that
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover, the
And different viewpoints.
It's true that the border issue was addressed and it was a major obstacle.
The historical ties between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were distinctive.
These links if we notice them.
Between the two countries and the two families
Broken due to misunderstanding
Neither from our side nor from theirs.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And now the relationships are in a position where I can guarantee that it is excellent.
In favor of the Cooperation Council
But how was the relationship between the island and Saudi Arabia improving while the island was the obstacle and the reason that led to it in the year 2001?
There's an important point.
And I repeat, if I go back to all the programs, I always say
Not just the elder sister, I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was a sharp exchange of words, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
Unsuccessful because the brothers disagreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
But they found themselves in a struggle.
Wherever there are camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone in this conflict.
But sorry, Sheikh, let me put things in perspective or dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers find that the island has changed a lot in the past two years.
At a time when the conditions they criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still ongoing.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Whether arrested people, opponents, or others, they are still standing.
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj turned into
Praising the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time when opinions differ.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because I...
What connects the two countries.
To stabilize the region
This strategy persisted and strengthened the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases around the Gulf region.
Also the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
Spoke from his heart about resolving, surpassing, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just from the perspective of opinions
No, it's about politics and politics is a matter of opinion.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
We talk about the same interest.
Now you've remained for many years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this topic and the second topic.
The idea of a small country facing large nations and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And his reasons ended.
Our two leaders ended up because of his judgment.
Is there insurance for future relationships?
There are guarantees between two parties.
On the basis of love, brotherhood, and mutual interest between the two countries.
And leaders, their words are considered more than just a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope greatly that this Saudi-Qatari relationship will develop.
The best will be there and there will be more fields.
This relationship is similar to the one we have with other Arab countries and other Gulf countries.
Because Qatar is an important country.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that it reconciled with Saudi Arabia at the same time.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
First thing, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And its benefit
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this situation
Can anyone believe that through this case we are trying to reach an understanding with our brothers in Egypt?
In light of what you say, you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
We believe he is a good person.
Our difference with Egypt lies in two points.
Or a single point.
You accused us of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't think...
"And we won't get involved."
In cases concerning other countries
What believes in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does this mean that you intervened in the Hamas coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course I don't deny it, in fact, we didn't know about this any more than others knew from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or caused disagreement among you on this point?
I come for this.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised about this subject.
Vibrate in favor of Qatar.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids spoke.
To attack Egypt and occupy it.
Can I reply?
Let's go back to the plot they mentioned.
Time will tell.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back to the Mina conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port that was held in Doha?
And this was an agreement, and when the conference was to be held with us
They said they didn't want to hold the conference.
Guys, we know you're coordinating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What are we trying to understand why?
We sat and talked, and the conversation was always good.
I have two parts.
What are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the Gaza conference that was held
Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were informed by a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have a viewpoint on the subject that it shouldn't be held.
And people are being killed while we sit and watch.
If you want to avoid complications in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be a mistake to discuss the issue on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference.
In Israel and the Western world, they stand and watch what is happening.
When we all said, "Well, now this is normal, and there is no power except from God. As Arabs, we cannot stop it, nor has any great nation stopped this fighting."
Egypt's request for a ceasefire in Gaza was heeded, and within an hour, the fighting stopped.
Even us too.
We shouldn't underestimate the Arab street with such innocence. Our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This is within international standards.
And there are not enough hospitals, and doctors are being arrested at the borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
It's there, and no one can enter.
The brothers didn't accept the matter well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we're just talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know his position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We hope a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza
The Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a conference presenting and I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to the conference; we were called upon to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
but will be released to
The affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and that was it.
Because it's off-limits from every angle.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you're expecting.
Give me just two minutes.
One minister boasted of something that was denied and said:
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official insulted his own country.
In fact, they didn't fail, and they only talked about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I told this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To summarize matters in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king will decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them, that's even an insult to those who actually did stop them.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
The limit has been reached.
He believes he must assert his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry for this.
If you think the small state has no right, its rights are being stripped away.
And you suddenly enter and raise your voice in Darfur.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A conspiracy, I don't know what, in Qatar.
If it becomes likely that the swine flu has appeared somewhere, Qatar will be the reason behind the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a secret policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arabic problem, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position on our main issues, namely Palestine and all the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analysis became like theirs.
Western analysis
But there's one thing we know, and we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way, I want someone to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Has Qatar annoyed any Arab country?
He tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I appreciate you and greet you, and you say: You're greeting me to provoke me.
This is a second case, which means you have a problem or a deficiency.
This situation doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems.
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks his mind.
My heart always says this.
I always say this.
I always say that even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I was saying that.
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island.
The matter is different, no, no.
From one perspective, we said no, there's no way we'll stop at this situation.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
They see their affairs and where their mistakes are.
And if we see our mistakes, it doesn't mean that everything we do is correct.
Do you mean this, Your Highness?
Due to internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form to a conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to break its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million if we can make it, not eighty million.
They still have another problem that needs to be solved.
You played a role in the Shalit soldier case, even though you knew this file was important to the Egyptian government.
And you hung out with the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
It is a matter that we have to deal with. We said, brothers, this matter concerns the Egyptians. They said:
Let's see this case as a request.
I'm from Israel and a second country. We want to see a second part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them if the same conditions from the brothers to speak with the brothers in Egypt.
And we announced this means can any official say that we, in essence, deceived the Arab League?
This means he is a poor man.
How did she manage to miss us?
Allow President Mahmoud Abbas to stay.
And we supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island as they accused me.
The island must engage in media competition because there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets, and at the same time, they all insult each other.
But after a while, they will reach maturity.
It might be or it might not be
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There's also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
It's a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the president of Egypt.
I hope it's just a difference in policies and perspectives.
I told you about the problem when the attack on Gaza happened.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar did to cause this problem.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
As was leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found it the next morning.
I had a meeting with Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Torn beyond repair
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it so no one interprets it as you're comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Satisfaction among children
I don't think so, Egypt is bigger than that, I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a plan to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything else because only God knows who lives and who dies.
And I claim
Someone tricked him and told him there would be a way.
And our pride in Egypt
There has to be a specific way.
Either he stands with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we struggle with it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has China's sources of power, France's sources of power, and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
What's clear is that
You're trying.
But we're a small country, and I took that into consideration.
And I'll repeat it a hundred times.
So no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one is taking it from us.
For Israel, you are being laughed at now.
Okay, before I go to Israel.
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America. If I can tell you about the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on self-interest, and so do we.
All complaints and everything.
To ruin the relationship.
I believe that any great nation that does such a thing will affect its image.
It will also affect our Arab pride if we start complaining about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there upcoming steps to repair the relationships?
I just know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Emir.
If someone is pulling the strings.
Opposed to documenting the relationship between the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself losing.
No, it could be tomorrow, it could be in ten years, to be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
We can't.
Because Egypt is our big sister, but we have different perspectives and we discuss them with each other.
This is all that is required, and when the time comes we will be very happy.
This has been canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you're asking about how many contracts were canceled, ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, last June 4th, you stirred the feelings of Arab countries when you closed the Israeli office, and that was published in Arts on June 4th.
Why do you say we started it? If we wanted to start it, we would have closed it twelve years ago.
Since each party had a campaign before reconciling with Israel and before secret meetings took place between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation of most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to play with people's emotions, we would have done it at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner at the residence of Israel's ambassador, Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this feast, and I don't know for what reason the ambassador organized it.
Because at the United Nations, we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope that relieves the pain of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egypt topic, but unfortunately...
What I was, you were.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Jad is serious about solving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with the United States is poor.
First of all, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you see the agreement still standing, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would allow them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We followed it day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in a constituency to correct some misunderstandings that had arisen.
But you still have work to do with the arrangements in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy visiting there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi affair, and there are some accusations that you supported them.
Or your interference made them face the state, and now they are in greater danger, the danger of the South.
We suffered a lot, and this is why we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
And honestly, we faced many pressures, but this was our vision and this was His Highness the Amir's stance.
The topic of the Houthis.
Its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
I just want to understand if this is meant for other purposes.
And we stand with them, always supporting them in all situations.
And what is based on the truth?
I think there's no need for us.
We sell it.
I say this with an apology, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, and we hope that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from Without Borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you and welcome to this special encounter.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional interview? Because...
Qatar and this man exactly was the main sponsor
Sir, just one simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was also important.
To achieve some results
It is very important that external intervention
Many opinions and suggestions from outside.
Lebanese and international Arabs if you want to say it.
He went through stages, but it meant something.
There's nothing unless it means that these stages existed.
Does this mean there are complications in Lebanon?
From the time of truth
I mean, when you were all gathered and then directly switched to the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Did you discover that the Lebanese complex is huge?
The Lebanese Arabic dialect is a regional variety of the international Arabic language that requires significant decoding.
Is it not a simple compound but grows due to external intervention?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese shouldn't allow it.
To affect peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
Are there external repercussions in Lebanon?
Suddenly, after twenty-four hours, she decided to take everyone on a single plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They weren't even expecting it, they couldn't rest for a single minute unless you were kind and let them.
The secret is to not let them rest or think too much.
And make many calls.
We are considering bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with many difficulties.
In many circumstances
We let them get out of these circumstances and into ones where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we need to get them out of this mood.
And quickly.
God made us succeed with a Phoenician or a Beiruti statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people believe that Qatar leans more towards one side at the expense of the other.
And from Beirut only.
His Highness's policy if we are intermediaries.
In this process
Well, frankly
Were you seriously consulted?
With at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in Lebanon: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we
Everyone needed a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
In the case of the Iranian nuclear program
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
And they organize conferences to find solutions, why can't the Arabs with their ancient ties?
Unite the Arabs or gather the parties if they exist, or intervene to support the oppressed.
This needs to be under study.
If we want to send an alert, it's to the Arab League, not to the university, to the Arab world.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is Speaker Nabih Berri.
requires
Now it seems the Lebanese have agreed.
Okay, listen, we...
And above them, Qatar.
What has ever led to a result?
In the interest of the Arab world
It will be considered a force for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Agreement
And schedules are designed for solving, not for other reasons.
There's no doubt that
And the most important role in the entire Arab world.
It lands.
Stop it by our agreement.
For others to come and help us
Because this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached the point where everyone is playing in our backyard?
In our yard.
It is very important that we put the interests of our people first.
Now we need the Arab League after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do about Somalia?
What are we going to do about Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and a miniature version of it.
I hope this idea is just a suggestion.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that if they ask us to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I'm sure that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, the President, Bashar
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It's just a passing phase.
With God's permission, we will find.
Nevertheless, I insist on asking if this is acceptable to you, could you take a role in this part?
Even if it's not in front of people right now, you kind of have confidence.
What rapprochement between Arab states do we seek?
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
What happened in Lebanon? Does this indicate that the region is on the verge of fundamental changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese affairs and regional issues that are still ongoing.
Not related to this situation.
I wish the opposite, I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It happens somewhere else.
In other words, Your Highness, are you afraid of the escalation that was present before?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There's no doubt I'm still anxious about Palestine, especially the Gaza issue now.
I want to ask
We need something else.
I request to take charge of the human side in Palestine.
We can't get the medicine to them.
And I didn't eat.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The one who dies when the power goes out.
I wish
The Arab League agrees on the amount for this food and medicine topic, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver them.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But please excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, but I'm saying that as Arabs, we must deliver medicine and food, even if we don't agree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and promised at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement is going to benefit the other party.
Your statement "Don't deal with this party because we will find a solution for you" is not correct.
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We might not agree with all of their policies, and they might not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want you to have relations or contacts with Israel.
Some people might see you as necessarily part of it due to the American rules present there.
We know how to handle this.
Some people said that after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia,
He might have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel.
I could say it was a coincidence.
The second point, the Saudi kingdom was keen to find a solution and I was in communication with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change the tactic. Change the negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible for
And from all sides we locked ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then his highness's intervention was very important.
From this stems the interventionist action.
Without me mentioning it now, it's over.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role," as if to say...
I wanted to take the role without provoking any other party.
Whether you are Arab, national, or regional.
But still
They became a responsibility.
Did you want this or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
These states
Can do or not?
I think this will be the profitable combination.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term? Is it ordinary or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It means we don't have different viewpoints in these cases.
But this is our right if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good is it? How can you interpret it on Earth?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Also health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and let's keep it clear in the next phase.
In my opinion, we should set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we wanted to stop the play at the Arab court.
And reconcile the hostility between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have any.
Be effective.
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our viewers in this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arabs and Arab efforts.
His Highness Sheikh Mohammed, welcome.
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue we will be able to
Elaborate on some of your questions.
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Sister countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance for the Arab countries?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
And no one was punished.
We are accountable for everything, whether intentional or unintentional.
We are the specialized people.
In the world and the ones who are always the target.
Always disciplined in a certain way.
I think
Until we can't.
For a meeting at the leadership level
To halt the discipline campaign
We didn't want to cause a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
Those who wish to be right and our perspective is wrong because the goal...
He is the solution to the problem, not a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking for now is that the ministry does not cancel Qatar's request.
And what His Royal Highness emphasized further
In his speech, he stated that we insist the summit not be held in Qatar if it causes any embarrassment; we don't insist on the summit taking place in Qatar; it can be anywhere.
An Arab stance that earns us respect from others.
Yes, and ministerial.
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He was not involved in the decision and continued the killing and bombing in Gaza, and it is still ongoing.
I need to ask the Arab: What are we going to do about this?
What are we going to do?
Is it when Israel finishes?
To implement the remaining Security Council resolution
Or there will be a strike because Israel did not stop.
Shooting, what we hate our brothers
The decision is considered final.
A few days ago
We'll talk about the ministerial meeting.
In the end, you will support this.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit. It was our idea, and some other countries, including Syria and Yemen, also requested it.
There is already an experienced Arab there.
Or prepare us for the camp of moderation.
And the camp of the non-moderates.
What do they mean by "no intermediation"?
That was arranged by the West.
As Arab observers and non-observers
You won't find a surveillance state or a non-surveillance state.
And we want to know what moderation means and what immoderation means. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And end the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we just need to keep the case open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are they the countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
I don't want to say that he follows Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name the camp Moderation
What does moderation mean in the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a reality that exists.
The existing truth is that there is.
Idea
What some people call a radical move
But we need to ask ourselves: What is this radical movement demanding?
Something that has no rights and does not demand its rights?
Aren't we going to arrange them?
And created other masses as well.
Against because we
Internal and cultured Arab
It's a rule that happens.
That's why we don't want to fight someone else's war.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who cancelled the Arab summit?
I can't say it was prohibited, there were some efforts and the topic was somewhat known.
Prevention topic
Just like I said, we could've been.
Hold a vote and get two-thirds.
But that wasn't the point, because it's not just a matter of challenge, it's a matter of urgent need. That's what we're thinking.
While some believed it wasn't an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel said it would act and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We won't exert efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What makes it different from the first meeting?
In disagreements, conflicts sometimes arise.
How much
Will we be ready to have a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
We strongly support our brothers.
Similarly, to address the Israeli party and inform them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four and we were committed to the ceasefire. Eighty-four and the Israelis weren't committed.
It is natural for disagreements to occur in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements...
They represent their positions and what's in their hearts.
One of the fights that was reported was
That there was a person who described Hamas' movement as disorganized.
Not even a little
This situation happened and we responded to it, and I had one brother among the ministers.
And I think this is what the West says.
These are radical moves, dismantling, and other names.
And we don't want to be men like others.
And that's why it's always the case, and I'm not referring to anyone in particular with these words.
Any foreigner they find.
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
Among the Arabs
His Highness is present now.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
His agenda has to be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred and a bit?
One million Israelis mobilized
That which was issued after Decision No. 168
The issued decision.
Israel hasn't carried it out, it will carry it out after completing the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
This thing needs to be grateful for in this decision.
In order to demand Chapter VII, because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And if asked, they will say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault.
If that's the case, Israel won't be held accountable.
She is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab Summit to what was going to be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try to help us.
A tough decision is needed.
Decision regarding...
Can make an official lose their position.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq entirely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
We don't demand from the Iraqi government, and we don't demand for the people who died.
No compensation.
The exact same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
His Highness
His Highness Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, they had some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
Israel did not commit to it.
He will commit to it in two days, after a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they didn't collect with him.
Sorry, but people have to unite.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was completed.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am friendly with the West and I have no problem with having any relations with the West, and I am not...
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, they take one percent from our perspective and say we won.
What is victory?
Including its contents
I can't say anything about precautions now because the decision wasn't made.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the training to some extent.
But you were invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
I just think the brothers who went are enough.
You returned to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For two years now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
I can't pretend we knew everything.
If they were people...
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there, the disputes began and the siege started.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we'll let them starve to death until they burn because we don't want them in power.
These are the parties named Sheikh.
Clearly stated, the Palestinian conflict is...
I mean, if there was
The one who created the Palestinian conflict could have been in a Palestinian conflict.
You tell the other party no, you are 100% right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I do not say so, and I do not claim so.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not just the average, as Arabs, we are still equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want it to exist, so we need to end it by any means necessary.
Once in training soldiers right and left
And once by surrounding them and not giving them money or salaries.
And whenever we set a positive example in the West Bank.
So that the people in Gaza can see how people are living.
Luxury living
While the opposite is true in Gaza.
I was invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but this time
Any talk still going on about him between Hamas mediated by Turkey?
This meeting you were invited to attend seems to want to overrun.
It would be deceptive to launch another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this case
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
A role is requested, and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
Just important
Don't come.
Tomorrow's party seems to have beaten another party.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what is required of Egypt?
The suggestions now, and the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Highness.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, which must exist and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Those who were injured on the other side, we must also consider their perspective.
To perform these intermediate tasks
By the way, to get a perspective
Hamás' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in shaping without communication or consulting the main party concerned with the issue.
We just want, and of course deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
We deal with authority unilaterally.
Now there is a split in the party in one place and another party in another place.
This means that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced about it?
Firstly, regarding the decision, he didn't mention a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some saw it as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading this decision is that it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in performance.
This stops the fighting.
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And it is considered that this resolution no longer exists because Israel did not accept it.
Even if he accepts it later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, Your Highness, when talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or the Arab conflicts that cannot reach a solution, which is why they came to fill the void.
It is supposed to be filled out by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A platform that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
That's why this is a natural role.
And that people must follow him.
There's no Arabic word that fits the situation.
One says, "Let them finish the mission."
There must be a clear Arab stance and a clear separation from all this aggression, its continuation, and procrastination.
There will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I'm not talking about a war between the Israelis and the Arabs, we are always the ones calling for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I'm not calling for an Arab war, I'm calling for...
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course you're following what's happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
You think?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the politician who emerged from the military operation will now allow Hamas to impose its conditions.
Does it have to be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
I don't know about this negotiation, as I told you, they are not there. Oh, now they are negotiating.
The second thing
Well, in the required places for Arabs.
This is the Arab truth.
He witnessed us after the start of those operations.
It seems that there is a very advanced position adopted by the Arab street.
As governments, we have...
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe the gift of nations as such.
They tell me about this problem again.
Representing people's views
The presidents now.
I mean, if they want to.
At least they see what
The request, of course, has a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
The Israeli representative office in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
Consider that the Arab side needs to be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
Not at all, if we had an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
To participate with our Arab brothers
If only there was a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that have nothing.
This is very important.
Don't be an agent for others.
He says, "Why don't you make Qatar a role model in this field?"
If this is the only model, we're ready to be in it.
We still want to
An Arab model from Qatar committed to a part of her Arab commitment.
Like
And no one sells to another.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret, I don't want to mention the intermediaries.
That's why it's very important.
For formal invitations anywhere because we need to rise above this.
Some called the ambassador, some organized protests, and some expelled the ambassador like Chavez.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent member states, and all of these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of people's demands.
Regarding high expectations, some demand the opening of fronts, and others call for Syria to open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace and we don't call for fighting with Israel.
And we don't want to wrestle with Israel.
Fights with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
What brings us together to talk and overcome our differences.
What you said, His Highness, caught my attention.
On condition that countries do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street won't spare us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what's happening today a continuation of a project that started in 2006 during the Lebanon War?
Or there is a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
Some parts of the course are still assumed to be a deposit with the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon, I mean we dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
To control and have the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them and they are foreign.
That's why he wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with "invaded"
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak to?
And how many sides?
While in Palestine, there is only one side.
I can only confirm to you again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and each one thinks that it will control the second part.
In your opinion, as an observer and spectator
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it may happen to those who disobey?
Or he expresses his opinion.
Whether it's Israelis or others in the future
And we set a high example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral proverb that says: "Me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother, and my cousin against the world."
Now we are supposed to be in any dispute with Hamas, and I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible from making any mistakes.
They all have mistakes.
Now we have to leave this topic.
Make the part kneel.
Because here, failure is not the failure of the group.
His Highness Sheikh Qatar, usually before a period, was trying to come up with proposals.
Initiatives to find solutions have emerged in Lebanon.
It happened in Darfur. We'll talk about it later, even if we're in a hurry.
We
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are certain sensitivities.
That country is taking all these initiatives, we have no objection as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to keep Qatar in the headlines.
What were His Highness the Prince's objectives?
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
Loss of control
What happened was beyond imagination.
We are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't know? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a solution to honor
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what was mentioned in the initiative concerning the Justice and Equality Movement to resolve the Darfur crisis.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
It will mainly be about solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem started at the beginning.
The Arab helped.
But let's not make a big deal out of it since we've made it an international issue.
Based on revenge against the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
We always strive, as I mentioned before, to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
Take the issue out of competition, is there still competition regarding Darfur?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we conclude the discussion, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Do you intend to attend it?
No, we're going to attend the summit.
We wish it had been held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was scheduled.
It will be a disgrace.
Okay, if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they were gathered there for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances, of course I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
And for safety
But no one takes anyone in their small pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani Thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So what is the point of this celebration and the credibility of the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What is the situation in our Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
These and other questions we will ask our guest in today's episode.
Former Special Rapporteur on the United Nations Conference on Disability
He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from the Egyptian University in Helwan
And he held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And the vice president of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
He also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Ms. Hessa, welcome to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we used the term "disabled people," perhaps in the 1980s and before.
A more educational concept when
Among those who are given such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
"About the term, before we go into the details."
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries but are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is the strongest compared to any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The trend towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and is present in many countries.
Resources might be available, and political will too.
Okay, let me tell you about some statistics you might know.
Eighty percent of countries are poor.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with disabilities from poor countries do not go to school.
Madame Hessa, how can you comment on these statistics?
He is largely genuine.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas prone to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
You can't distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy person because they are in large numbers.
In fact, the children suffering from female illiteracy, for example, are almost three fifty-three or two fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from reaching school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have any infrastructure, even if this child found the school.
What he can reach.
For children and other residents
These schedules and projects are excellent, but we rarely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago. What is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities.
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects.
Implementing a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an intersection between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world and it is getting better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her because she was at the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society for the child now, for example, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for demanding the trial of the regime because there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Welcome, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If you don't mind, I am one of the people with intellectual and mental disabilities.
I hear Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
And in the Quran there is a verse that says: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah has given us speech. Praise be to Allah, who gives speech to all things.
I spent thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
Praise the Lord, for He has given me speech.
I was referring to the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference, and they consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me, unaware they're in the depths of hell.
I only got slander.
And he does not speak the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
Of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding the inquiry of Brother Suleiman, it also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out to what extent.
There are disability issues and cases on their practical agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations indeed address disability.
It's one of the programs that try not to overlook children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and good schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings, and we must acknowledge that there are also shortcomings in the United Nations.
What are the main points of weakness and inefficiency that you mentioned?
United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered things.
My work especially sometimes during constraints or shortages after
Struggles or tries to fight for recognition from people with disabilities.
Until it reached a point that was somewhat satisfactory, unless it was placed in a separate article as desired by the Global Disability Movement.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there's no coordination between them.
This is one of his main flaws.
The survey, which was implemented by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies, and they only provided us with three responses.
Don't give up.
The issue of disability is persistent, stable, and ongoing for many years, even though at its core, it is a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and other activities.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international regulations?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating a salary to people with disabilities.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Does this money go to governments or to United Nations offices, and does this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
The final remark is whether there are binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
We have Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia with us, hello Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
She adopts this proposal.
And that is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To be converted into this box
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
Go back to our guests so I can answer the callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have surgery but
It costs him a lot and he can't afford it, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be obtained by the citizen.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Obligatory for all states and must be limited to ensuring the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials, there should be awareness primarily.
It has to be at least this way if we work on these agreements like this.
Even if there's no great commitment towards it.
Is there any response to the monitoring reports you conduct, and was there any interest?
But don't forget the rules, it's a morally binding document, not legally.
You have an obligation and it's legal.
And he understood that these cases would be resolved or discussed or would be within the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakherna, Manager, National Center for Sign Language for the Deaf Expert at Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera.
They just broadcasted this episode live.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
I also say that many people have special needs.
Some of them don't know about this agreement because there were no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I would emphasize and insist to these countries that
Adopted and signed this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document to serve people with special needs and serve us.
Thank you very much, Naji, I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion might influence the decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with the proposal presented by the caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Establishing a support fund
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities that the special rapporteur is engaged in.
Even the Arab countries did not make donations, only one: Syria.
Confronting those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
Unfortunately, lack of commitment by member states, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we don't care about the current situation.
In fact, it's a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, especially
Just for this reason, in these covenants.
These countries should honor their commitments, nevertheless, it is a good idea presented by the brother.
Above all, it is essential that there be no single independent box in its full sense, but rather the organizations that already exist in the region.
Who are the ones who have it in their budgets?
Special projects were offered to people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities
The problem always relates to political factors.
His state or government has guaranteed significant support.
Unfortunately, reducing the number
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, citizenship was revoked.
Take her daughter.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Traveling or going out, we hesitate.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
"And we are grateful."
They rebuild themselves, knowing.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Behjat Kawan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, hello.
Peace be upon you
And upon you be peace too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah bint Khalifa.
I want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
For the continuous support of Sheikhah Hessa to them.
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
There's a second level, which is genetic.
I believe there is a genetic interest in reducing the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a cousin always marries his cousin.
In this way, at this level, the level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as you said, at the national level
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Falls within healthcare services
Those who also fall under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I believe in the mental clinic and also the programs in the Supreme Council of Education.
The Special Education Department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists or not.
Of course, within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation was provided for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and it points to the genetic factor and marriage between relatives, are there campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And one of the things that I and others have discussed a lot about, with a lot of talk and a lot of shares.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not targeted only at women.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
And which has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive any positive feedback?
Especially when it goes against customs and traditions.
Of course, its difficulty arises when it clashes with the collective culture.
In order to have a decision, he must have strategies, have the will to deal with this and commit.
The issue of early screening, for example, because it is a very important issue before marriage.
I ask if there are statistics about people with disabilities?
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
Arab region
Especially
With the recent events that happened in the region
In regions, conflict zones, and especially in wars and disputes, thus.
For every person killed, there are three disabled.
What happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places?
Not even close to enough, and first of all, the problem
Human rights principles
There needs to be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Agendas within institutions in government and non-government ministries.
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only your words, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet.
In the world, the strangest thing is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about the census.
To what extent are people with disabilities not included in statistics conducted on the resident population?
They always announce that.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and with the
Prepared by the Council as a fait accompli and with our participation, such as the Office of the Special Rapporteur
To create more classifications for disabilities.
The needs that should be present.
The types of those needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
At least
Statistics are being conducted in this regard to some extent.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you to Sheikhah Hessa.
But thank God I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I thank Ms. Hassa.
Her motivational role and the role that made us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those who rely on this category.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar. We are still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My dear sister, the reality, expectations, and what we await is the solution to our children's problem.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope she can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
And I attest to the special services provided by the State of Qatar for people with hearing impairments.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even civil society, NGOs, or other communities
Because reality and what we wish for, if you compare them after five years,
What was provided for people with disabilities five years ago and now?
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan, now let's go back to our guest.
Of course
The society as a whole with its individuals and especially with its families who have
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children without identification papers or other documents, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international convention resembles many international documents.
And we are committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Alright Sheikhah Hessa, you were a special rapporteur previously and were concerned with disability at the United Nations for six years of work.
Did you wish?
Perhaps the time wasn't sufficient or the financial aid wasn't adequate.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, through existing organizations, and through government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that we need to work on constantly and fundamentally.
Coordination among Arab countries
Among people with disabilities themselves and their organizations, because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They have to fight for
Many thanks
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinion and comment with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and correspondence in a new episode of "Live." Goodbye.
Good morning
I'm very happy you're here with us.
First and foremost, before we start asking you various questions and chatting this morning
Thank you, Shaima. Maybe I was lucky.
All of the Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has really put itself on the world football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Also me, come on Ali!
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and the work will start today or during the advertising period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite having strong files like America, Japan, and Australia, why were you afraid in this field and specifically on this topic?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said there's a seventy percent chance that Qatar will get it.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitive.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's file was really strong and deserved this.
True, the 2022 World Cup file and the hosting in Qatar.
What do you think, how do the players themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel great joy, God willing.
I love %pw, we used to talk off-air, but we want to hear it on-air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you? How did you hear the news? Were you surprised? Tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then everyone joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and that it had secured the hosting rights,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima
I went there that time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP were filming there.
We had interviews afterward.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar now, daily, is being mentioned.
A hundred times a day, considering it is the smallest place on Earth.
I assume everyone knows Qatar, even on the internet.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country, being in the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
This is positive that one works very hard to
Be in the league, even when he's in the league he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he carries the league's logo on his shirt, so he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort in taking care of young players, teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Eat, Sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at different age levels. How was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
For every stage has a special sign.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We're both used to your athletic nature now.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We love to see you and follow sports news through you. So, how is sports going for you?
I, frankly, don't see it differently from talk shows. In talk shows, we used to interview famous stars in their fields, and also in sports, we used to interview stars afterward.
Like Ali and the others in their sports field.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And now Qatar has become the global capital of sports and football.
Instead of presenting various talk shows on social, economic, and cultural topics.
There are different courts, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still sports.
Excellent, superb
Frankly, I wished
I wish I was ten years old now, not twenty-five.
I think the young players have gotten a great opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is excellent, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they have to take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
They have a great advantage.
Tell us, what are you doing, what new programs do you intend to present, I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about the new things you have, God willing.
We always follow events, and we are preparing for the Asian Cup which starts in January.
We finished the Gulf Cup a few days ago, and by the way, we'd like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The newsletter is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari TV, and of course my roots are from Qatari TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Let's convey the media message through various channels.
Whether they are private, sports, or other channels
So thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you all the best, we're still on the same topic.
First, I'd like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And its fans, I have been in Al-Wakra Club for a long time.
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Still at the club
I'm still a Wakrah boy.
Okay, as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
This concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people really love and are addicted to sports.
How do you make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in all the various fields of life.
I said that the youth are addicted to it, and schools have also become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, reflecting people's awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also indicates the awareness and involvement of women in the field of sports.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for female players.
For I believe that sport is evolving.
I also believe that this period of time
To produce massive projects and increase awareness of sports, I assume this timeframe is sufficient.
If it is thought about and implemented carefully.
This is enough and at the same time it needs to be used thoughtfully, as I said.
Also, at one point, is how the new generation exploits the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's one more important thing, praise be to God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are known for our passion for sports.
How can we attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending matches at the same time
Most Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse web forums, you find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, what do you think is the best solution to attract you to attend, aside from being an athlete or a player?
What are some ways to attract an audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there's no general concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering at home.
For instance, Japan, Japan has made a wonderful plan to attract the public greatly.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something, they are looking for solutions, God willing.
and Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar, especially in the year two thousand and twenty-two, Lana, what do you think we need?
Apart from financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participate in the big tournament, the World Cup.
Time flew by with the good people. When the producer told me the time was up, I said, "By God, God willing."
We always achieve the impossible, we achieve the dream we thought was impossible. Praise be to God, we're living it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins now.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of Qatar's name.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global brand.
Hosting for twenty-twentytwo
Thank you, Lana, for the wonderful introduction. I wish you success, and I will always follow your shows to stay updated on sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new type of music that has become popular these days.
But in a repetitive way with music and a fast rhythm.
And also the Haween rap group, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and wishing you a good morning.
We'll try to take a quick look at it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
It's a repetitive performance, but not a rapid rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
This consists of numerous rhymes and addresses a variety of different topics and issues.
It can sometimes be personal.
Social, emotional, or political.
Often controversial,
It's largely free.
Performing rap, viewers singing the lyrics,
He just repeats it.
He flirts with his voice, which is a secondary asset.
Generally, sound isn't important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or an MC.
Singers are concerned with the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, the flow of sounds, synchronization, and connection.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rap.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
Stand out in something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
Why is it present in Qatar?
So we said, "Let's invent something new."
We gave him an idea that includes a message.
We talk about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So we deliver the message first and second, it's an art.
It is a form of multimedia art, for the viewer's information, addressing many social and psychological issues among youth in a radical way.
Time changes, and I think this has something to do with the changing of the times.
Before, there was little acceptance.
We've been singing since around 2005, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in 2010.
He is more acceptable and popular.
People love to sing and perform in a style similar to rap these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a large percentage of people.
And also in something we're going to talk about, you were the founders of many bands.
A beautiful band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that someone could form a band, and how many of you are there in this band?
At first, before the band was formed,
Rap arrived in Doha starting in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and upload it on the site.
I can carry, Salman can carry, anyone can carry, so there was a competition.
We met the people.
So we started competing with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we reached the year 2010.
Before 2010, there was a group system, meaning each group was separate, and three or four people were together.
So we said, "Why don't we all unite as one group under the name 'Rapperz Qatar'?"
Or in English, Q Rappers.
So we agreed on this, saying under one name and we are all one hand together.
And we come to present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, a large group.
So, does anyone here play rap or, or, or do you all sing rap?
Coordinate and assemble.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Everyone has their own abilities.
It means that every member of the band can write a complete song.
Without any help from a second person.
But abilities might be different, for example, if Salman is better than me,
He hears it and tells me to change the words here, change something.
It is possible for each to turn into the other.
We help each other a bit.
Or a company that adopts, so that official bodies adopt these works,
And there will be the appropriate distributors.
So that the work is done in a sophisticated style and becomes something official for you.
Frankly, we hope to get support and receive backing from a label to adopt us and produce an album for us.
We don't have any problem.
Some things are a little difficult.
Why don't you think the first move should come from you?
So that the individual can recognize the first CD.
By doing this, you can later attract companies. What do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
It's normal because in 2007, rap wasn't dominant in the Gulf.
But not as famous as now.
We were talking before the broadcast, for example, in great groups like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about the subject?
They said they'd organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs and procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great job.
There was just a bit of pressure because there were no ads and nothing before the party.
There were no ads, nor anything, two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
This was a beautiful point.
It means our voice still reaches families, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal to young people.
But at this stage, we discovered that many age groups were listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most of the songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The whole group
What are words, and how do they address different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before *
It has to be this way.
I mean, it rhymes.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs you produced
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the talk.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it mentioned the name of my program.
This is KD's program and DJ MREldoha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KJ, Madam Bobo with SKT, it's really hot on the body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are the Qatari rappers, of course.
Because it actually contains the name of the program, thank you guys!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it last night.
And who wrote the words, or are they?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
It's not just that I write this out of love for singing and passion.
I assume you have to write about the 2022 World Cup, the Asian Cup, and I suppose you can if you're able to.
Yes, personally, I'm producing a song about this topic.
No, I don't think he can be formal at this stage.
So I assume there must be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone
We're watching the live stream now.
The cup has arrived and Doha's streets are adorned.
The viewers, as we saw, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned parties have made all the preparations for hosting.
And it will be more crowded.
I suppose they'll gather along the corniche.
I'm sure they're ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up?
There is an offer from an official party, they promised us they would organize a party for us.
Okay, still, there are some complexities.
The procedures and some problems, we're not sure.
Let's try, if I meet Youssef and see.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of implementing them.
When I'm at home.
And then send it to Youssef by email.
This part of the song is for Youssef.
There's one more thing, do you travel abroad?
In this field, they have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but listen to people who are advanced in this field.
We just try to be competitors.
Why don't we take some ideas and imitate certain things?
But on the contrary, I take the idea and apply it in a different way in my song.
The one who founded a band and has more than one CD.
A person named Abdullah Al-Dalil
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
One of the residents of the city of Marrat.
There are many experts.
Those who determine groundwater before drilling.
This requires or makes it possible to drill some wells in places where there is water.
With the help of copper rods and pomegranate branches
Or figs, which can help locate water tanks.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
Now, they have been replaced with copper bars.
We placed the two sticks next to each other.
And she walked slowly.
We notice, when we walk along the stream.
The sticks are going to open.
Now, we're passing by a flowing stream.
It opens this way.
When we count it, it starts.
Now we're in the middle of a stream.
And here, the medium is bacon.
In this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater, in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site of greatest intensity.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
In reaching an advanced stage in this profession
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In times, outside times, in Shaqra, Harimla and Athiha.
Over one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
Requires training, experience, and God-given talent.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Marat Town, northwest of the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we arrived at different addresses, but they are all hers.
Meaningful
I assume there's a large group of young Gulf Arabs in the Gulf.
Are there specific people you follow as examples?
You follow instead of imitate.
There is a general connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, I mean if I produce a song.
Who addresses a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have relations, but no one is me.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He
He has fans and CDs.
Many companies want to rely on it.
Do you wish to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it with more and more, God willing.
We wish you all the best through this team.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's see some shots of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
This, even if borrowed from the West, is in the Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band consisting of twenty-five people.
It's important to stay in touch with you so we can know your news.
So I assume you have an email, a website, or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close without apparent reason.
So we faced many problems and eventually locked it.
No use, the site is surely going to shut down.
What can we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to communicate with them to know the latest news and the songs that are released from time to time.
So what's the alternative now?
Currently, we rely on special pages like
Under what name
Okay, when you search for our name on Google.
Qatari rapper or Qatar rapper
You can make your own music video.
As for the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded a lot of videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
I think you need to see more improvement.
You need a place that brings you all together instead of each person having equipment at home.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we get the support.
For example, a company.
CD production
A special place was allocated for us.
We work for ourselves.
At the end of the day, we're still working on ourselves.
We don't want this.
What differs from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
Video clips make the song spread quickly.
Transmits ideas faster.
If there's support, everything else will fall into place eventually.
And your beautiful voice is everywhere.
It's a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see it and wish them all the success in the name of our program, guys.
These projects were, yes.
There's also another project that's almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cash register, you already have the total and all the details.
He recognizes goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
And you walk with the cart
It's attached to the cart, so you can choose the item you want.
Most projects reflect children's perception of the problem.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza when she established the center.
Maybe later, yes.
which takes him directly to the underground train from his house
But the idea is that it's designed for clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell t-shirts will be displayed.
It might also be with the car key, press the button.
He shows me the things I've lost and leads me to the key.
Yes, let's go back to the projects that the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Developing skills and nurturing talents
Therefore, it varies according to the different skills of the children, the tools, and the research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading the audience
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with Future Media, we were excellent in this project, we reached the end, the project graduated.
We also got numbers from children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have any young presenters?
Regarding television, it's important that they broadcast programs for children.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We are preparing them until they reach the age of eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
And this is still the national television.
We need to attract, discover, and develop these talents.
Media or research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition, is also...
The science club played a significant role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partners.
Professor Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
which also includes a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a step forward towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very large place
Dealing with the public becomes easier.
These are pioneering and excellent projects.
In welcoming the guest and introducing the programs offered to the child
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted and supported this project.
This is a big project, developing reading, writing stories, and developing children.
Various cultural skills associated specifically with reading
Because it's in different programs for sure.
We moved recently.
And we're rearranging some activities.
Design and improve it to suit Katara visitors.
We wish you success, through this center.
What contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting me.
The most important thing is, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests and imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They ... %pw, the way they treat their children like a hotel, providing them with accommodation.
Or like a bank, it saves money.
Children really need someone to listen to their ideas and imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for being with us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
Until these projects are realized and do not remain a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Culture Center was launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing ceremony of the National Exhibition of Future Generations' Dreams under the slogan "Dreams of the Generation: Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and several competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
We welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, dear sister.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for the time you've allocated to us.
Let's talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover as many events of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
With the contribution of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
"Who was"
In an attempt to calm the children
Live the dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So we determined it to be twenty or thirty.
And other key areas in Qatar's Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Later, when you think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What exactly do you mean by this sentence?
Is it facts or the nation of tomorrow?
I mean, whatever the child dreamed today.
He is growing as the project grows.
In fact, this was the true interpretation of the vision; the children will live from today.
I dream big.
Whether they are environmental, health, human development, or any other field
Who serves the country.
I think when we know there are children somewhere.
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
At the exhibition, there were also guest speakers.
For children to learn from, as old models.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, there was the *
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule to present their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence for what you're saying.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here after the last project owner, the forest.
And also we will talk about the colored ball.
This is a very clever idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, in four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is the colored ball.
They call it the smart field now.
As soon as the ball goes out of bounds.
Colors differ.
I assume in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
What's next, after all these dreams?
And it is connected to things related to his field of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But we never know, maybe these projects will benefit us. What's the opinion of the Football Association president?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Many, visited projects related to football.
He supported and adopted these projects as soon as he saw them.
He also adopted these projects.
What our children did, people also voted for many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that existed in the place and received the most votes from people?
There is an evaluation committee with a method to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for submission.
Of course, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very detailed instructions in the pamphlet distributed to visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we see now.
These are some of the big projects.
They might be trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it is accredited by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects. What are these projects?
Collect, use, and recycle it.
From two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman, the renewer, and we continue in the same artistic atmosphere. Today we have a very dear guest.
From a family of a series of classifications, the actor Abdelhamid Cherchani.
He asserted himself through numerous works such as Hearts for Rent,
And they exerted themselves to establish themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
What does that mean?
Thank you, good morning, and I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the show's cast and crew.
We'll see a very short scene from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake bisht and keep the real pocket.
Go and get it.
You have the coat, you'll return it.
What? Give me the best, return it to me! How can I return it?
The goat has already ground it in its belly, damn.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't agree for you.
I have no objections.
This is a quick glimpse, a very short part of a series of classifications that we will see the second part of.
We'd like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your parts in the series of classifications where each episode has a different theme?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I was passing by the mart at that time.
Marat is famous for the mountain.
The quantity of poetry that poets have celebrated over time.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
It shows the antiquity of his history.
One hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe it was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its ancient monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
Poets were inspired by him and enamored with him. He was renowned for the famous Mount Cithaeron.
They call it Wadi Kmit.
Of course, Marrat is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam
There were ancient things with an unknown history, like the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we're in now.
The companion of the Prophet, Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him), ordered, during the time of the Ridda Wars, the digging of this well.
He's still here.
The proverb says "Assurance of quantity," and I assure you many times over.
If you see quantity, you can see quality.
Another effect is the Wadi Kmit.
What has Merrit Stream been through over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of the establishment of these ruins is unknown.
There is the bride and there is...
Mount Kuwaymat is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
There was a lot of poetry built on this mountain, poems and verses.
Many people from different regions in the kingdom come here.
One of its important monuments is the Al-Waleedi Well.
This is because he remained in times during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He set up camp there and ordered the men to dig this well.
Some people still drink from and wash with polluted water.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed by Marrah.
It's an old house made of mud that was restored in a manner similar to its original state.
It consists of various sections reflecting the region's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of her: "When we reached the water, the water of Majan."
We came across Wadi Kamit, not Wadi Angel.
Professor Ayman, hopefully there will be cooperation between the family, guardians, the center, and also the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Since anyone comes to us, whether an intern, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, he has an evaluation every month.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
Guardian through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he reach it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, from the day he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later,
We see different models, I wish we had enough space.
Nevertheless, we created a girl model.
They're running different tests before going live.
We'll ask her math questions and different types of questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back to see this smart girl. Stay with us.
The actor's performance, the audience has become very smart now.
If any show catches his attention from the first, second, or third episode, and if he feels he's not interested in the show, he'll use the remote.
He won't tire himself out, he has twenty thousand other things to do.
Correct, twenty thousand series, that's right.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't focus on one job.
He can see other works.
This is true, this is the majority.
He says I only watch TV in Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, a very dear and highly honored guest, Abdel Hamid Charshani.
Do you have anything to say to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I tell them, hopefully every year you meet it in good health and well-being.
It's true that we don't go out much, don't appear much, and don't act much, for the reason I mentioned before.
What's coming will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you every success in this year's endeavors.
Inshallah, we'll have another interview with you so we can talk about these plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are looked forward to by trend enthusiasts.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Doha Morning, and we are live with you.
Of course, today we're talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have registered at this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing the second capabilities.
And also to make their minds work fully.
Ms. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khalegly, Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome to us.
And with us today is the beautiful Amanya, good morning Amanya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
God willing, we wish you all the best.
What are the things we provide for our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically directed towards the benefit of the children, our children.
Minds Program for Mental Calculation
By fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to expose a small part of them.
Did you notice, Professor Ibrahim, that there was a real difference in the student's performance in the first two days?
And after he finishes in maybe three or four months?
Whether taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program works scientifically on specific methods.
After you complete the first level of the program,
What reveals the lost potential or what needs to continue developing.
Has it reached a certain level or what updates have been made to the child?
So we work in a scientific way, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after he completed the course or levels he passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, O viewers. Amany is one of the students who registered at this center.

This is a very brief paragraph and a small part of a series of classifications that we will see the second part of.
But as we've seen, this part of the series is a sequel to the first part.

I can't recall many actors right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Muhammad Adel.
Tara, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
Currently, we have little work in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that too?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV channel did its best, but in one year there's only one job and all the actors in Qatar want to work.
And that was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
So whenever someone encounters a scene, they must thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
So let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasem is among the best of humans, even after the dispersion, yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater.
He is the one who adopted us, taught us, and made us.
Then, Mr. Ghaniem delved into his life story, and did his best, in Faez Al-Toush 2000.

The killer sensation is produced by Tara Arts as well.
The director of the series is Mr. Mounir %PW.
We're back, dear viewers, and today we're talking about reflexology.
The message is on the palm, the palm of the hand.
This treatment was actually practiced, since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The inspection method is as follows.
Swelling, degree of pain.
You can feel inside the hand that there's something like sand or broken veins inside the hand.
Loosen your grip.
My brother is nervous.
You feel pressure and have a bit = tension, tension.
The left side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem that is obvious, we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's shivering. Do you have a sinus problem or any previous issues?
I had surgery, but that was a long time ago.
Is it just a cold?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is due to stress, when I told him his nerves were tense.
Ten years ago, he was walking barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think it's empty.
Any uneven ground, not just the sea.
Negative energy possible %PW.
And he might be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, children are the most important.
Oh children, glory be to God. This is for the mother, focus with me!
What hurts him is the milk and the food he eats.
Her child is parallel to her, she will put him down and the child will automatically lock.
Clench your hand.
Just a bit of pressure, praise be to God.
She will find it in a few seconds and the boy will be happy. First, he will be in pain due to the hurt here.
Then you'll see gases suddenly rising.
What discoveries did you make, Professor Abdulaziz?
But with fewer other problems, people are now suffering from arthritis, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing for menstrual pain or period pain in general.
She must focus on a stone or stones, by pressing here, you give orders to the lower back and menstrual problems. If you have pain,
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
Delivery has become easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her that there's a chance she'll give birth on the seventh or she might give birth on the ninth.
Except on sand.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
She has to eat seven soft dates for breakfast, soft dates are better.
If she doesn't have fresh dates, regular dates will do.
As Allah the Almighty said, I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, my discovery is from the Quran.
This means that God could not have made this soft date reach her, but He was not incapable.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge from the evil of what I am saying.
She has to bring stones or small balls.
Labor bed. For example, if you forget and end up on the labor bed, hold onto the handles.
You'll notice in private hospitals, a East Asian woman comes.
This is an exercise in East Asia.
No need, you already have my phone.
Only the mobile!
I advise everyone who is listening to me now to cooperate with each other.
Make charity a habit and care for people afterwards. You are created to worship God first.
Serving people, that's the first thing. The second thing is, I'm not a religious man or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank you, Professor Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and also thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak more about that.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
Is the program part of the national strategy for the treatment and control of obesity?
Around four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
They're afraid of its spreading more and more soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize this competition together, so it becomes an international one.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because this is the first stage where they become conscious of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, the topic was "What is your favorite fruit?"
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! Every time you walk, he gets points.
This is a map of Qatar, and every time someone gets points, they move forward, their schools move forward, and their marker moves.
A beautiful competition arises among the students.
In the second week, Mei drinks water, not soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink all that soda every time he feels thirsty. Drink water!
Then, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We're looking for a sport he loves.
So we can force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows they need to let their child eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take.
Of course, this is a model, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we enjoyed a lot with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin has improved now, there are fewer pimples.
This is true, this is true and becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And their classmates from different grades, asking them "How are you?" and learning from their peers.
Praise be to God, it has started to spread that many schools are enthusiastic about participating next year from now.
Inshallah
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which hosted sports competitions and awareness events.
On, on, on, on the dining table.
Praise be to God for the existence of many official entities, some of which I mentioned and some I forgot.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
Secondly, the brothers structured it as separate lessons, a curriculum, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
It's the next generation.
To publish this experience or expand it as much as possible in Qatar.
When you move in, there are some things you need to fix.
After it spread widely and achieved satisfactory results,
Insha'Allah, we will spread because people are asking us why we weren't present.
Eat, eat all healthy food and get to it, you don't have a problem.
When he reaches this age, when he starts from a young age, he will achieve what he wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
Your happiness mentioned a set of titles; each set had a title.
If we return, we'll try to make our segment today about the conclusion of the activities.
And when we mentioned people again in our program, we had more than one presentation.
Let's review what information we want to deliver to the student each week.
Okay, the first thing, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he began to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking. People think walking is only for the elderly, why don't young people walk?
So when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your heart and mind.
It relaxes the individual, meaning the clarity of mind improves.
I took the students on excursions.
Yes, they were all required to walk, whether at home or at school.
They record their points with the class teacher.
What they used to walk daily.
There was an event where people held a procession, and the girls' school also held a procession.
They want them to like it, they are creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers need to think differently; we don't want them to give them ideas they have to adhere to.
Everyone has their skill in this area.
Of course, the third week is drinking water, all the time we try to make them drink water, so they don't feel thirsty and dondădădădădădădăd
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
He is interested in sports.
Their love for sports is shown through practicing them. He plays sports unconsciously.
We said earlier that we are talking about the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Qatar.
Let me welcome our guest for today's show who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this show.
And part of it is this disease that some of us might not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we'll go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
What affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the cause of suffering from this disease is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
The treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm or other illnesses.
This disease is an infection in the brain's nerves and the spinal cord's nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered the body.
A nerve cell is
Insulate this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
That which leads to the non-arrival of the nerve signal, weakness, or interruption.
Leads to paralysis, God preserve you.
No, with the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Okay, apart from the solution, we want to know how to get it.
Similarly, a person needs to be protected from this.
The main reason is quality of life, nature of food or lifestyle?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
Everything we have now is theory.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve human health problems.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we don't know its causes.
Well, the age group that may have this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to calm down with the person.
So far, we haven't been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar.
Recently, just last week, I was told about three to four cases that were diagnosed.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, as recorded in the files.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatment in other countries.
Alright, Professor Abdulaziz, are there any symptoms similar to those experienced by someone with this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
We need to be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Due to the nervous disease, the nerves control the entire body.
When giving a specific reason for a particular location, food nature, or lifestyle.
