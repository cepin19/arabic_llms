There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon. There were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf, her husband, was a righteous man. He didn't want to humiliate her in front of people. So, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was pondering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
You will give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All of this happened so that what the Lord said would come to pass. He spoke through the prophet.
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he did not go near her until she had given birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
Wise men visit Jesus.
The birth of Jesus took place in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
"Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard about this, he was very disturbed. All the people in Jerusalem were also troubled.
Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "That is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Afterward, Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He told them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me news, so that I too may go and worship him."
After they heard the king's decree, they set out on their journey. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different road. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
Then the wise men departed. Joseph had a dream in which an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose and, during the night, went to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
Stay there until King Herod dies. And those words spoken by the Lord through the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I called my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was very angry. He gave orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys two years old or under were to be killed. This was in accordance with the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
You hear a voice in Ramah. It is a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are gone. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family is returning to the victory.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
There was a town called Nazareth where he grew up. And so was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah was speaking about. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the entire region along the Jordan.
Those who confessed their sins, John baptized in the Jordan River.
When John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
"The fruits of repentance and piety have emerged from your sins."
I don't think you can say in your heart, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is now under the roots of the trees. All the trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down and burned in the fire.
"I baptize you with water, for repentance. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
His fork is in his hand to separate the chaff from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the chaff with an unquenchable fire. - Isa deliberately
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "It is I who should baptize you. Why have you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
Jesus was baptized by John; he came up out of the water. At that moment the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Isa Ketgrī
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where the devil tested him.
After 40 days and 40 nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"Unless you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down." For it is written: "He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." (Psalms 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"Unless you bring me down and make me a slave," he said, "I will give you all of this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
After the devil had left him, angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus came from Nazareth. He lived in the town of Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said became a reality. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people dwell! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The territory east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Those living in a dark land will experience a shining light. (Isaiah 9:1,2)"
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chose the first disciples.
One day, as Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately, they opened their windows and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their boat and their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus was healing the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
The news spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all kinds of sick people, some suffering from great pain, others possessed by demons, some violently shaking, and others unable to move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him, including people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, and Judea, as well as from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who are spiritually poor. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Congratulations to those who are sad. They will be consoled.
Congratulations to those who have no pride. They will be given the land.
Congratulations to those who are hungry and thirsty for justice. They will be satisfied.
Congratulations to those who show mercy. God will show mercy to them.
Congratulations to those with pure hearts. They will see God.
Congratulations to those who make peace. They will be called children of God.
Congratulations to those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Congratulations, from me, they laugh at you and hurt you because of me. Even when you're blessed by me, they say all sorts of bad lies about you because of me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Even people don't light a candle and put it under a plate. On the contrary, they put it on its holder. Then it lights up everything in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. They will see your good deeds and will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
I don't think I came to abolish what is written in the law or the prophets. I didn't come to do that. On the contrary, I came to give full meaning to what is written.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter or stroke of the law passes away until all is accomplished.
Do not break even the least important of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, obey and teach these commandments. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I am saying to you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder.
"You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not murder (Exodus 20:13).' Whoever murders will be subject to judgment."
But this is what I'm telling you: Don't be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Moreover, whoever says to his brother 'Raka' must appear before the Sanhedrin. And whoever says 'You fool!' will be liable to the fires of hell.
Imagine presenting your gift on the altar, and considering that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come and offer your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and is suing you in court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still on the way with them. If you don't, they might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officer. And you could be thrown in jail.
What I'm about to tell you is true. You won't get out until you pay the last penny! Prostitution
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. (Exodus 20:14)
But that's what I'm telling you. Never look at a woman in a bad way. Whoever does that has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. Better to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell. Divorce.
"If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I'm telling you. A man who divorces his wife pushes her to commit adultery. And a man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she is unfaithful to him. Oath.
Once again, I heard what was said long ago to your ancestors. They were told, "Do not break the covenants you made with the Lord. Keep the oath you swore to him."
But this is what I'm telling you. Never make promises like that. Don't give them in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Don't take them in the name of the Earth. That is the throne of God's legs. Don't take them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads. You cannot make even a single hair white or black.
Let your "yes" mean "yes," and your "no" mean "no." Anything more comes from the evil one. Be kind to others.
"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I will tell you. Do not fight with an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well."
Suppose someone took you to court to get your shirt. Let them take your jacket too.
If someone forces you to walk one mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn your face from him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
I've heard it said, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But this is what I am saying to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who have harmed you.
"Your Father in heaven will make his sun rise on both the evil and the good, and send rain to both the righteous and the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what reward do you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
"Besides greeting your own people, what more do you do than others? Even people without religion do this."
Be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to people in need
Be careful not to do "righteous deeds" in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
I assist people in need without boasting about it. I don't act like those who do good only to be seen as pious. They teach people what to do in temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by people. What I'm about to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
"From those who give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Your deed will be secret. Your father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
"As you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
Whenever I pray, I enter your house. Close the door and pray to your Father who sees what is done in secret. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret.
As you're calling, don't prolong the conversation like those people without religion. They think they'll be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask.
This is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
Keep us from falling into sin when you try us. Deliver us from evil.
Forgive people who sin against you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But unless you forgive people their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Fasting
To me, fasting without eating, you shouldn't look glum like those who do it just to appear pious. They make their faces look excessively sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm about to tell you now is true. They've already received their full reward.
But how can you walk without eating? Put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
And afterwards, others will not know that you have acted. Only your father, who does not see it, will know. He is the one who will reward you. Your father sees what is done in secret. Hide wealth in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will be where your wealth is.
The eye is like the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But what if your eyes are blind? Your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and not like the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
As I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, and what you will eat or drink. And do not worry about your body, and what you will wear. Isn't there more to life than food? Aren't there things more important to the body than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wildflowers grow. They don't work nor spin clothes.
But that's what I'm telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.
Only thus does God clothe the wild grass, and will He not clothe you any better? In the end, the grass here is only for today. Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is too small!
Don't worry. Don't say, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
People without fear of God run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge others.
Don't judge people. So they won't judge you.
You will be judged in the same way that you judge others. You will be measured by the same standard by which you measure others.
You see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but you do not notice the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get this splinter out of your eye," when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
You're a liar! First, remove the splinter from your own eye. Then you'll be able to see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Knock, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Ask, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks will find. The door will open for him who knocks.
Suppose your son asked for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
We don't ask for a fish. Who among you will give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, you still know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
"So everything, do to others as you would have them do to you. This is written in the scriptures and among the prophets. The great and small gates."
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk on that road.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few will find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they are by what they do. Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pick figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree doesn't bear bad fruit. And a bad tree doesn't bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to Me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven will enter.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?"
I'll tell them clearly, "I never knew you. Stay away from me, you who do evil!" The wise and the foolish build.
So everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
Winter is falling. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. But it didn't fall. It's built on rock.
But whoever hears my words and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
Winter is falling. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. And it crashes with a loud noise.
Jesus said all these things. The people were amazed at his teaching.
He acted like someone in authority. He didn't speak the way their religious teachers did.
Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to him and knelt down before Jesus. He said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said to him, "I am willing to do it." "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his skin disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." And the centurion believed.
When Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him; and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
"Sir," he said, "my servant remains in the house and cannot move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal them."
The leader replied, "Sir, it's not right for you to come to my house. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I am a man in charge. I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I tell my servants, 'Do this,' and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you that many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they are of the royal line will be driven out into the darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will be done just as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
That evening, many people came to Jesus, bringing with them those who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
Fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said, "He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him and gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a religious teacher came to him. He said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
One of them said to the other, "Sir, please allow me to go bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calmed the storm.
Jesus walked on water. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a bad storm came up on the lake. The waves hit the boat. But Isa was asleep.
The pupils went and woke him. They said, "Sir! Save us! We're going to drown!"
"Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. There was a dead calm.
The disciples were amazed. "What kind of man is this?" they asked. "Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two demon-possessed men met him. They came out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"God's son, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before the time of our trial?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned.
Those who had been tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone everything. They informed the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
And afterward the whole city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus healed a man who could not walk.
Jesus walked to the boat. He walked to the other side of the lake and came to his city.
A man came to Jesus carrying another man who was unable to walk. The sick man was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. He said to the sick man, "Do not be afraid, my son. Your sins are forgiven."
And then some of the religious teachers said to each other, "This man is saying very bad things!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
The man stood up and walked home.
When people saw this, they were greatly amazed. They praised God, who had given such authority to people. Jesus chose when.
Then Jesus went on from there and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house with many tax collectors and "sinners." They all ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Walk and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to follow me." Jesus pleaded for fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "Why do John and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of fabric onto old clothes. The new piece will pull away from the old one. This will only increase the tear.
People don't put new wine in old skins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. No, they put new wine in new skins, and both are preserved. A dead daughter and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was speaking, a man arrived. He fell to his knees before Jesus. He said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live again."
Jesus got up and walked with him. So did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She was sick and bleeding. She had been suffering from this illness for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
She thought, "I shouldn't touch his stuff. I'll get in trouble."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not lose your faith; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
As Isa entered the master's house, he saw the flute players there. He saw the throng that was roaring.
He said, "Go far. The girl didn't die. She's just sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the people had gone, Jesus went inside. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus did became known all over that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
Then Jesus went on from there, and two blind men followed Him, calling out, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
As soon as Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
And then He touched their eyes. He said to them, "Your belief will come true."
Now they could see again. Jesus firmly ordered them, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They gossiped about him throughout the whole area.
As they were going out, they brought a mute demoniac to Jesus.
The genie came out of me, the man was astonished. People were surprised. They said, "We've never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few paid workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and infirmity.
Seeing the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
The lord of the harvest sends workers to serve his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve disciples. The first two are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Next is James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After them come Philip and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. The last two are James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus called the twelve together and gave them these instructions: "Don't go where there are Gentiles, and don't enter any Samaritan town.
Instead, go to the Israelites. They are like lost sheep.
"From that time on, he began to preach, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.'"
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Don't carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belt.
Don't bring any bags with you on the trip. Don't bring extra clothes, shoes, or walking sticks. The worker should be given only what he needs.
When you enter a town or a village, look for someone who is willing to welcome you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
As soon as you enter the house, greet the people living there.
Except your home welcomes you, bestow upon it your blessing of peace. If it doesn't welcome you, don't bestow the blessing.
Some people might not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't do that, shake the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I'm about to tell you is true. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
We will send you among the wolves like sheep. Now be wise like a serpent and innocent like a dove.
Beware! The men will hand you over to their local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
They will bring you before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses against them and against those who are not Jews.
But when they release you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, they'll give you the right words to say.
It won't be you who is speaking. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
The brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. The children will rise up against their parents and leave them to be killed.
People will hate you all because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"They will attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you now is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It's enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it's enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can the people who live there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything concealed will be uncovered.
What you whisper in the dark, say in the daylight. What's whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Why are two birds not sold for just a few pennies? But neither of them falls to the ground without your father knowing about it.
It counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You're worth more than a lot of birds.
Why does anyone say in front of people that they know me? I'm going to say in front of my father in heaven that I know him.
But what should I say to someone who says this in front of people who don't know me? I'll say it in front of my father in heaven, whom I don't know.
I don't think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring the sword.
Let's create "Children against parents. Girls will refuse to obey their mothers. Daughters-in-law will be against their mothers-in-law.
"The enemies of a man will be those of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Those who love their father or mother more than me don't deserve me. Those who love their son or daughter more than me don't deserve me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Until he finds his life, he will lose it. If he loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Suppose someone welcomed a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And suppose someone welcomed a righteous person as a righteous person. That person will receive the reward of a righteous individual.
Imagine someone giving even a glass of cold water to a little one following me. What I'm about to tell you now is true. That person will undoubtedly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Sally followed Jesus as he taught his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Jesus asked, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see.
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Congratulations to them for not giving up on their faith because of me.
"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
Unless there's something else, what did you go to see? A man wearing nice clothes? No. People who wear nice clothes are in the palaces of kings.
And what did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, more than a prophet.
That's what it says in the Holy Book. It says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has two ears, let him hear.
What can we compare today's people to? Like children sitting in the market and chattering about people. They say,
'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral hymn, but you did not mourn.'
Whenever John comes, he neither eats nor drinks like you. And people say, 'He has some demon.'
But when the Son of Man comes, he will eat and drink in your presence, and they will say, "Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' " Those who are wise will prove their wisdom by their actions." The cities that do not turn away from sin
Jesus seemed to speak against the cities where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not changed from their sins. He told them,
"How blessed will you be, Korazin! How blessed will you be, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I'm telling you this. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sur and Sidon than for you.
"What's the matter with you, Capernaum? If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
"But I'm telling you this. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sodom than for you." Rest for all those who are ill.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father. Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and have revealed them to infants.
Yes, Dad. That's what I wanted.
Dad gave me everything. Dad is the only one who knows the son. The only ones who know Dad are the son and the people the son chooses to introduce him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my followers and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in spirit. You will find rest for your souls.
My job is easy, and my load is light.
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus went through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
He entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath the priests in the temple perform their duty on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
I'm telling you that what's more important than the structure is here.
The book says, "I desired mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I didn't understand what these words mean. If you knew, you wouldn't accuse innocent people.
The Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath day.
After he left that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
One man had a withered and twisted hand. The Pharisees were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
The man works more than the sheep! So the law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to him, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it became whole, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to say who he is.
This is to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. He said,
Hadi is my chosen one. He's the one I love. I'm very happy with him. I'll protect him. He will announce to the nations that everything will be fixed.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He's not going to break a bent branch. He's not going to extinguish a flickering flame. He's going to fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub
A man possessed by demons came to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man could speak and see.
All the people were amazed and said, "Is this the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that you cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Don't even think about it. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what's his? You first need to tie him up. Then you can steal his stuff.
What is not with me is against me. What does not gather sheep with me is scattering them.
This is what I am telling you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But the evil spoken against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light." "Whoever speaks against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven them; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven them, either in this age or in the age to come."
A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds. A good tree does not bear evil fruit, just as a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
You den of vipers! How can you, being evil, say anything good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks good words. These words come from the goodness within him. A bad man speaks bad words. These words come from the evil within him.
But that's the very thing I'm going to tell you. On the Day of Reckoning, people will have to account for every careless word they've spoken.
"Your words will determine whether you are found guilty or innocent." - The miraculous sign of Jonah.
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. "Teacher," they said, "we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"The unfaithful and unworthy people demand a sign! But they will only be given the sign of Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this is going to happen to the Son of Man. He will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will stand up on the day of judgment with this generation. And the men of Nineveh will stand up against them in the judgment, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It passes through dry places, looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
And then he says, 'I'm going to return to the house I left.' When he reaches this house, he finds it empty. The house is clean and tidy.
And afterward, the unclean spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation." Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and your siblings are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jawabo Isa, "Who is my mother? Who are my siblings?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
My father in heaven is my brother, my sister, or my mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
And then he told them many things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seeds.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some of them fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil wasn't deep.
The sun rose, burning the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
The last seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and overshadowed the plants.
And some of the seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop, a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
He who has two ears, let him hear.
Jawad had students. They asked him, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
"I've given you the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. I haven't given it to outsiders."
Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will gain more. In fact, they will have a lot. And if someone doesn't have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
That's why I use parables when I speak to people. I say, "They see, but they do not really see. They hear, but they do not really hear or understand."
They fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah, who said, "You will surely hear, but you will not understand. You will surely see, but you will not perceive."
"The hearts of these people have become callous; they hardly listen with their ears, they have closed their eyes, otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
But your eyes are blessed because they see. And your ears are blessed because they hear.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore they last only for a short time. They quickly fall away from faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promise of wealth choke it, preventing it from bearing fruit.
But there are some who receive the seed that falls on the good soil. They hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was dozing, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
Jau went to his master's servant. He said to him, "Master, didn't you plant good crops in your field? Where did these weeds come from?"
"That's what the house wants," he replied. "The slaves asked him, 'Do you want us to go and clean the veins?'"
"No," the owner replied, "from me you graze the grass, you might graze the wheat with it."
Let them grow together until the time of harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my barn." - The Parable of the Mustard Seed and Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field.
It is smaller than all your seeds. But when it grows up, it becomes bigger than all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour until all of the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he said nothing to them without using a parable.
Now the words spoken by the prophet have come true. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell parables. I will proclaim things hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "It is the son of man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are the angels.
The wailers will be uprooted and burned in the fire. That will be the Day of Reckoning.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
He's going to throw them into the blazing fire. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
And then they will shine like the sun in their father's kingdom. Whoever has ears, let them hear. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very precious. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered every kind of fish.
"They made the rounds, and the fishermen brought them ashore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish."
This will be the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will throw the bad people into the burning ball. There, the bad people will cry and gnash their teeth.
Suleiman Isa: "Do you understand all this?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Sally Issa is the one who tells these stories. Then he left from there.
When he had come to his own country, he began teaching them in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't he the one who grew up here, and whom we know? Where did he get all this?"
Is this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Are all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all this?
They were not happy with him at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and among his own kin."
A little more miracles there, because they didn't have faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
Then Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "That is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why he has such power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is against the law for you to have her."
Herod the tetrarch had John the Baptist killed. But he was afraid of the people, because they believed that John was a prophet.
So when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests. He was delighted with her dance.
He promised her by oath to give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. He told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was shaved, a large bowl was given to the girl. Later, she took it to her mother.
John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. He went away by boat to a solitary place. The crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt compassion for them. He healed their sick.
It was almost evening when the pupils came to him. "There's nothing here," they said. "It's getting late now. Send the people away. They can go buy food from the village."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves and two fish."
He said, "Bring them here to me."
After that, Jesus called the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish. He lifted up his eyes to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the pieces that were left.
The number of men who ate was around 5000. The women and children ate too. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately the disciples got into the boat and went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, while Jesus went up the mountain alone. Then he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them, he went alone to the side of a mountain to pray. When evening came, he was there by himself.
The raft was too far from the shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing against it.
So early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and got very scared. "It's a ghost!" they said, and started crying in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Master, if it is you," Peter asked, "command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord! Save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt me?"
They made me a hero, the wind calmed down.
And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and came down to Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding villages. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They begged him to let the sick just touch the fringe of his garment. And everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked him,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not keep the command of God? But you prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But make people say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
It's not right that they don't honor their parents with their gift. You make God's word useless to follow your own teachings.
Oh, you comforters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me.
Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean." What comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
And afterward his disciples came to him, saying, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand it yet?" asked Issa.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Bad thoughts often come from the heart, just like murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. Also theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus went from Galilee to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived in the region of Tyre and Sidon came to him and pleaded with him, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
He didn't even say a word. His students came to him. They asked him, "What's wrong? She's crying behind us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And then the woman fell to her knees before him. "Master! Help me!" she said.
"It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus walked from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
A great multitude gathered around him, bringing to him the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind began to see. And this caused the people to praise the God of Israel.
After Jesus called his disciples to him, he said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
The seven loaves and the fish were taken, and He gave thanks. Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered up seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the people away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
They asked about Jesus as a sign of a miracle.
Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening, you look up at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'
And as the morning unfolds, it says, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You understand the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot comprehend the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students were talking about this among themselves. They said, "He must be talking like that because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small. Why do you discuss among yourselves because you have no bread?"
Don't you understand? Aren't you thinking about the five loaves of the 5000? Aren't you thinking about how many baskets full of pieces were gathered?
Don't you think about the seven loaves of the four thousand? Don't you think about how many baskets of pieces were collected?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
After understanding, the disciples realized that Jesus was not speaking to them about the leaven of bread, but rather warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declared that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what's on your head?" asked Sol. "Who do you think I am?"
Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I have been telling you. You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He said to them, "He must go to the city of Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He must be killed, and on the third day he will rise from the dead."
Peter said to Jesus, "Not at all, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
From now on, Jesus called his disciples. He said to them, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
He who wishes to preserve his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world and yet lose their soul? What can they give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I am going to tell you is true. Some of the people standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The transformations of Jesus' appearance.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, up a high mountain by themselves.
Under their eyes, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. Those around him became bright like light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as they were still talking, a cloud shone beside them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my son, and I love him. I am very proud of him. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they were very afraid. They fell face down to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Get up, do not be afraid."
They made me go up, I didn't see anyone except Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you have seen," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
The students asked, "Why do the Sharia teachers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, it is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him. They did to him whatever they pleased, just as they will do to the Son of Man.
After the disciples understood, they realized that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who was possessed by a demon.
Then one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. So he went into the Pharisee's house and sat down at the table.
"Oh my God," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shakes his head a lot and suffers a great deal. He often falls into fire or water."
I brought it to your students. But they couldn't fix it.
"People, they don't believe and they are evil!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the child here to me."
Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed immediately.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
"Answer, 'Your faith is too small. What I am about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing is impossible for you."
(No
They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is going to be handed over to people."
They are going to kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus is paying the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. When they entered the house, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Ah, what do you think?" he replied. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties from? From their own children or from others?"
"From others," Peter replied. "Then the children don't have to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find the coin you need inside. Take it and give it to them as payment for my tax and yours.
