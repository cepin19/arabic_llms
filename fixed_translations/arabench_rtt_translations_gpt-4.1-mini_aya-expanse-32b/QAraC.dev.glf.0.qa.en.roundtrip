You are very hungry.
Are you eating or not?
No, I'll eat.
Tell me, is it before that?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I've been patient enough with him.
This is our chance, our cars are embarrassingly old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Stupid! He has no confidence in himself.
Ha, scared?
What really bothers me
He is in charge of the budget.
What is the project that he is responsible for?
This is a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
Which means I will
Consider me in!
It's not fair that I don't benefit from this.
Won't I get anything?
This means I'm involved too.
We all have to take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
In a word
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like everyone else is doing.
A feast of wealth lies before you.
Take your share.
He didn't have a single penny in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the last third is plunder.
His son is healthy.
He went to Souq Waqif.
One lantern costs eighteen riyals.
They budgeted for it.
180 riyals each.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
I get bored of him.
I seek refuge in Allah from the devil.
Yeah, but I think he's changing his mind.
God willing, my Lord.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Above all, don't forget us.
We are your friends.
We need to be together.
Such a government project is an opportunity.
Sure, Oh! Ali
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
And God willing, everyone involved in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
We're not worried because you're members of the project committee.
We're worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your friends not to worry.
"Really? Abu Fahd?"
This is good news.
Just wait! Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Insha'Allah, everything will be fine.
Get Saleh to agree first.
I'm taking care of it.
I was wondering if I'd get some benefits.
Is this possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is for it to remain a secret between us.
And you found in front of you a plate of rice and meat.
Sure, I will do it.
Bon appétit! (Literally: "With pleasure and health")
What's wrong with you!
If you stay so distracted,
It's not going to work.
This isn't going to work.
Or questions
We'd be happy to help you.
How are we going to get our share?
Isn't it logical?
What shall we call it!
And we're not the only ones who are going to take
Every participant is asking for their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We're the ones who determine the budget.
What about the land he bought today?
Does he still have the violin?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
He called me today.
Because my brother's phone was off.
I said, "What's wrong with you?"
Tell your brother.
Second Earth
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He said please call him to confirm if he wants it, I'll book it for him.
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What happened to our money?
We consider ourselves participants with him.
Even if we weren't involved!
You're biting off more than you can chew.
At least give your brother and mother a little.
I'm not here begging you.
We are still participating in the project, and we have the right to claim our share.
Tell her, tell her.
True, when the sultan came and asked for his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him speaking to them.
They allow their brothers and friends to enter.
I know that government projects are free for anyone.
We don't want just a limited amount of money.
Paid-in capital.
His brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wants to.
because it seems that the committee members
Project budget
We just want to
Thank you.
Ah, Abu Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You're going to like it.
He will benefit the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh!
I'll be in charge of the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Oh, gang!
Take your share.
I, by God,
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want in the way you prefer.
The most important thing,
We are too.
For this week,
Everyone sets the amount they want to have.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
He asked for another hundred thousand.
Okay, but why like that, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting job, ignore him.
There are also the orphans' funds.
More budget.
Many people love to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! Is it your father's project!
Yes, this is Sultan.
My brother, Sultan.
It means he is involved.
Is this the nickname?
Your friend Saud mentions many names.
He keeps adding names, saying, "Let's benefit from them."
Should I add it to the percentage or the amount?
No, put him with the beggars.
%pw How much do I need to give him! Give him 20,000.
Yes, enough.
They even added a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
Okay, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be considered part of the first-phase budget.
As a bundle, no one notices.
Ah, there's more to the list my mother sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Haha, may you live long.
Apple of my eye, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
May God bless you, I told you this last time.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
What! Hey, wait, wait... How much do you need?
Enough for the liver, accommodation, and hospital!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers do you plan to transplant!
One, but my sister is precious.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Do you give her your money?
Reassure him and tell him that I won't take anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Man, they're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
I could embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mama.
I have a lot of work.
Then, I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the feast increased.
The infrastructure is capable of enduring.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will keep giving us installments.
How much is it! We want to know!
Will they give it to us all at once or in installments?
Why does she get more than us?
Whether it's a power outage or looting, it doesn't matter. The most important thing is that we remain silent. We're waiting for them to come.
He told you to stop talking, so you stopped talking.
Don't be shy.
If I hear any of you speaking
Sew his mouth shut.
Let's stay a little longer.
You know this, it's not an easy topic.
How much was it before?
Fifty million
It looks like you're taking a big bite.
You're the boss after all.
We don't want a headache.
Let's agree on the budget.
Professor Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is full of vitality and very important.
It's not just for this generation.
Yes yes
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we heading!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
Don't you see the officials speaking and the people applauding them?
We are at the official opening, how are you?
Okay, now they're talking, which means we're in the project.
Yes, we're in the project.
And people sweat.
And these barriers, I don't know how they put them there.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
The official opening of the %pw International Beaches
Third millennium, what's in you?
I really don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they fired me.
He just parks his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
Receive checks while comfortably at home.
Why do you tire yourself, dear, don't let anyone bother you, Munira.
You should thank your God, Manira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
Be anxious about your portion and invest it.
See my friend Hassa,
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We act this way.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Trust us!
I don't know.
I didn't feel satisfied with what my brother Rashid said.
He always reminds me of the check they give me every three months.
Enough, this is my right.
He always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Financial and inheritance matters need to be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
Do you know how it affects people?
And the mother of Salman is an example for you, the poor lady.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But it's just work, and this is your legal right.
And then what?
And we run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problem, no headache.
She said she was passing through the land, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
Any problem?
Your sister has started *spinning*.
This is the problem.
She's going to get us into trouble.
It's our kindness to give her money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We must find a solution to this problem, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity I receive every three months.
Everything is clear.
Only forty thousand, no more.
As if they aren't investing the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking.
This is true, everything I said is true.
They give me a little at a time.
If I only saw their wives.
He has a lot of varied diamond jewelry.
I don't have what they have.
They don't feel I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
This is your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are stealing from me and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is unpredictable, my dear!
They tired me out, made me sick, my love!
Do they know there's an account and a reckoning?
And indeed, Allah punishes them for taking other people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, my dear!
They'll be happy.
Is it because of our large population?
That's why I call you my darling!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a skyscraper.
I just want my rights.
My father wants to build a mosque before he dies.
And give to the poor.
The mother is the mother of Slemain.
Keep your voice down, dear!
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are being stripped away.
You were asking the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him.
Answer them!
No, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't frown.
Do you know the door you entered from?
No, no
No falcon.
Oh, what a pity, Saad.
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure he's her evil husband.
Because she is kind.
As if I'm begging them.
It's a well-known law and a confirmed legitimacy.
He says to me, "Either take six hundred thousand, or take nothing."
Not fair
Expect anything, Manira!
My father's company.
Eight buildings.
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says only six hundred thousand.
With the signing of the waiver document
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper. Be cautious. I'm warning you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else. They can't prevent you from knowing.
But the company,
You are a partner.
They fired you from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
Is it your father's company?
Don't you see him screaming?
Let me in, I'm telling you.
Leave it, there's no need.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, make him stop.
We're sorry.
My brother Saad goes to the office and explains to them, they don't know.
Come in.
See if Mr. Nasser would like to drink something.
Please come in.
Sure %pw
I expect we'll get into trouble.
He will discover how much she has.
He's going to find out that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the accounting.
In sixty-nine months,
This is the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
Okay, what's up?
Let him do what he can.
Frankly, I tell him.
Our money
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
May God bless you.
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission for anything.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go get him, get him.
Let him see all the files.
She is supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention the topic.
She was saying, "Poor thing."
Her father left.
Four buildings,
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is larger than the second one.
God suffices us for everything, and He is the Preserver, O child.
It's not fair what they're doing.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Umm Salmin?
I have to sue them; there's no other option.
He quickly glances through a few papers.
The case was adjourned.
Be careful, my son, Nasser.
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh! Madam, you're here and the doctor is looking for you.
Wake up, Mother of Salmin.
Go to your room.
All the Muslim patients
What he told me
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, now I remember you, yes, yes, I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
What about it, brother!
No problem, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
You think this Abdullah they sent can do it?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, for many years.
Does Monira tell the truth?
Even Abdullah, he advised me.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
What's that to people who live seventy or eighty years?
This is for people who will live at least two hundred years.
Umm Salama, may Allah have mercy on her.
May God have mercy on her, she used to say.
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do we have to be embalmed to consult the court?
This is he.
Yes, my love, are you sitting with them?
Good luck
By the way, he's an old friend from school.
Life is short.
And I ask for your benefit
And you come from a large and well-known family.
Deep-rooted.
Come on, Rashid, we're friends.
Please leave while I'm still calm.
Or you'll get beaten.
Walk, forget the topic of friendship.
Are you going out or what?
I paid 190,000 riyals for a diamond jewelry set at the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get all this money from?
They waste money on their wives.
And they deprive their sisters of their money.
Do you still hope, Nasser?
They killed you with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you to do.
Well-known and deeply rooted people
Maybe, why not?
Okay, I also suggest
God bless this talk with these intelligent faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with that which is good for our life in this world and the Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than the topic of my sister's fate, please share.
It's true.
Better go, or you'll get beaten.
What matters to me is what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
What matters to me.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Do not listen to her.
She's not going to court.
After tomorrow
I'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Goodbye
Kindness doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was at risk.
Let's see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow so we can go there tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and crush us.
To get your share of the inheritance.
Yes, she did it.
May your life be sweet.
May your life be perfect.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first park your car in the parking lot.
You'll see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Business cards of all lawyers in the country
I'm sure you need them.
Come here and mock us.
She's going to sue us.
Go to the court.
Listen to Manar.
And he signed a waiver document for us.
The beautiful one.
Know the way
We showed you the way.
Come on, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is the Al Raya newspaper today.
There's a really good article.
It was written by a woman, and I assume she's a doctor.
I want you to look at it, as a gift *from me*.
His living conditions need to change.
What a pity.
He has four children, but his home is unhappy.
Surely he will be, at the risk of all his wealth.
Invest in this project.
The one I never expected to start a project is Bou and Walid.
Eat, eat, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid.
My love, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, grab some fruits for yourself.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
By force, by force
My son, Waleed, gave my brother a little candy.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed. You deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Daddy, if we become big merchants, I want to have my own private room.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Present, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry.
Forget their wishes for now.
Just like everyone else.
Replace our small, miserable house.
First, let's pay off all our debts. Then we'll see.
You seem to be very happy, Bou Waleed.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, his luck is good.
All my father's hair is gray.
Blessings to the project.
Save some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese person, I was among them.
While we were sitting, we exchanged seats, he gave me a catalog as a gift.
After that, one of my friends saw her.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
"It's always like this."
These are computer labs.
Press the cinema.
If you want the professor...
This is magic.
They were amazed, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, and some from my relatives. I sold a piece of land I had, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has agreed,
Why didn't you ask for it since the ministry agreed to it?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
The secretary didn't call, my brother.
And stay away for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
And the council approved it.
Why don't you expect it?
Aren't you a full-fledged general manager?
Why don't you go to him to get it signed?
I told you he can't.
It's not just him, all the employees there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
You have to thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Finished?
How am I supposed to finish it when Abu Fahd never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
My father is signing as fast as he can so we can finish; I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say you are his secretary, what about us?
Give me your mobile number.
I'm the secretary, please sit down, sit down, it's not him, what's wrong with you?
Don't call, you scared people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Abu Fahd.
%pw, my money for fixing the bathroom
He is very stupid.
Guys, wait, wait.
Okay, okay.
He told you to shut up, enough, be quiet.
Bu Fahad had to go to the airport.
How did he manage to do that?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God helps you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear.
He's just acting strangely.
And when he receives the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs him.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
He is here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Oh brother, I told you.
I told you.
It's beyond my control, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but it's not fair.
The class starts next week at the university.
If I register, I have to wait until next semester.
Three months will be a waste of time.
Oh! My darling, I'm trying.
Don't you see me going to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
And I'm staying at home.
Don't you understand?!
Don't call me during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
Okay, God willing, Abu Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
He wakes up in a state of panic.
He walks and talks to himself all night long while sleeping.
If it weren't for Fahd's fall,
God helps him.
Therefore,
Bu Fahad needs to sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
Come work once.
And he traveled for a year.
And he abandoned the welfare of the people.
Oh oh oh oh oh, what do you mean?
Are you feeling better now?
Completely disassembled me.
This strange fever is dragging me, pulling me.
What does he want?
I heard I'm going to the ministry.
To prepare my documents.
He told the staff that he would punish me.
The time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
She is Bu Fahad's secretary.
I love to tell you that
Bu Fahad will come tomorrow, for sure.
As soon as I call you,
Come directly.
Good night.
You were never one of those people.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on the screen of your mobile phone.
I said it's a pity.
To feel responsible
And if you commit yourself
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifty boxes of printed paper.
Fifteen boxes of printer paper
He is poor.
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he had gone, the manager would have known him.
Sure, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of that, but let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'm leaving, but I'm waiting for a phone call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait.
How am I supposed to know where I'm going?
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley by alley
**T
Call the hospital quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
Long time, Abu Saeed!
What were you thinking?
About fourteen years.
As a messenger
Terrible headache
Sweating without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike was easy before?
With a yellow mark
It was a very difficult time, O Abu Saeed.
Misery, boy!
But what can we do, son of Adam?
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry guys, the manager arrived as he said he would. Let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived! Sweetie, let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son, Khalid, was an employee.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Toilet thief
I told you when my last son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Praise be to God, I'm almost done with my work.
Served properly
Praise be to God.
Change your mind, Abu Saeed!
And you deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz!
I'm truly grateful, Abu Abdulaziz!
Are you?
We did our duty.
Let them continue the journey.
This is your right.
After all this age and work
It means they're all running back and forth quickly.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife is nagging me.
I'm celebrating my retirement.
A coffee pot and some dates, what a wonderful thing.
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry because of the khanafresh, Abu Saeed!
Don't worry.
Ready-made thief
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the contraption is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
This is your chance to seize it today.
He told me that their manager was going to travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't want to move at all.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye.
Bless me.
There's no work anymore.
That means you're free, dad.
Present, please, Dad
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahara is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brought a cake.
I can't.
I myself sent my father to get me some papers printed.
The flower is sad.
Present, Mother.
Dad quit his job.
God helps him now.
Work enough, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khanafresh.
I attended it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
I left the old man exhausted.
As soon as he came back,
I was tired.
Don't bother me about their singing.
Don't bother me about their singing.
I was going to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said that he would punish anyone who was late.
Sure, my love.
Go to your job.
With this nose, and these small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you to a place every day.
As you wish, Umm Saeed.
His smell.
In my nose
Coward sells cowardice.
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, dad, take it to the market branch.
And go there.
Sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me it's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
The sun beat down.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me, "What's wrong?"
What drove you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat Khanfoush now.
Mom, where's Dad?
I'm going and coming back.
She told him which bank to go to.
They told him that some papers were missing.
She asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is Dad now, is he better?
I slept a bit, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
They are poor, Mother Saeed.
They have to commit to their work, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
As you like it.
%pw Bo Shahin
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How do you mean?
Before, in the past,
Misery is written for me.
Your children are old.
I need to help them.
They used to tell me
You're wrong.
Do you think all young people without a father don't finish their personal work?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to go and complete your personal work.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin?
I'm going to finish some papers for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this cafe.
By taking him to the land offices
Goodbye
What's wrong with you, Mom? I'll see you later, goodbye.
This won't do you any good.
I warn you.
I heard you say it to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
What matters to me about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent.
And he doesn't talk about it.
"You've tired him out, fear God."
Your very loud shouting woke me up from sleep.
Dad, I was a government employee and you know very well what storage means.
And they write this first.
And now they are %pw, doing this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Present, my son
You believed a lie.
He says he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you wish
Go immediately to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He's been silent since he came back home.
That's what replies to me.
You have no shame whatsoever.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree to this
Many thanks and may God reward you with good.
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling his servant?
You are the person we respect the most, Father!
I'm grateful to you.
Forgive him, please.
Let me teach him a lesson.
From now on, Dad!
And relax.
Drug dealer (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, O father.
May God reward you with good.
We decided that from now on,
We'll do our paperwork ourselves.
Thank you very much, may God reward you, praise be to God.
Please, Father.
Consider it the last.
I just can't.
They just called me.
Dad, I'm not going to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister is upset with you.
No, no, no, that's not how it works. You can't upset the minister. You have to go, even before him.
I'm not going, father. How do I say it? I don't want to upset you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider it done.
He will be on his way. When will you finish Saeed's papers?
Please, Dad.
Consider it your last resort.
I'm happy to serve you, father!
But your son should sign this paper.
Do you mean I have to give it back to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
And when they see the papers
You have to wait two months.
No, give it to me so I can sign it and then I'll bring it back to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and tell him to come, just for two minutes.
Finish him.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's going on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Every time I ask my friend, "Where are you?"
He says he's with Saeed.
I'm waiting for the working hours to end.
Alright, guys.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your children?
Don't you have any children?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I'll leave you.
And go to the old age hospital.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you telling them, Abu Saeed?
I'm writing something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
Not exactly my sister.
Why do you care?
I told him never to watch TV or listen to the radio.
This talk about "fighting corruption" has caused us problems.
May God guide him to the right path.
Alright sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What can I say to you?
He called the program named "Maylas" I think.
He spoke with the man.
Khaled Jassem
He told him to stop the corruption.
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
No one from his friends.
Those who encouraged him to do so,
He left it.
May God guide him to the right path.
Sorry, I have to go cook now.
Welcome anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and exhausted from this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mother.
I'm sorry I found out about this.
I told you about this.
What is it, mom?
And he shouted.
This is an engagement.
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Let's not talk about him.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
It's unfortunate, after all these years, you're firing me.
You don't listen.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, weapon.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well-informed
We just fired a few people.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Abu Manira, doesn't find out about this.
He's already mad at you.
Who's going to know?
If someone asks you
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Of course
His mother has to say that he...
What can we do with him now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
Whatever you see is right.
I'll give him two weeks.
Okay, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to get my daughter divorced from him.
Drink your coffee.
You're only hesitating because you have something on your mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are confined to the house.
I know you're dying of curiosity.
Go to the café.
To talk nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Mom, I told you, I broke that habit.
I swear
Mom, frankly, I'm a little bored.
Don't talk nonsense.
Act as if you were deaf.
It is a change.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your talk about fighting corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Is Saleh here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the café.
What did he say?
Do the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around him.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it was your mistake,
His mistake was not stopping you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who just quit smoking.
Should we speak up or not, should we stop corrupt conversations or not?
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
Or a halt to corruption.
Professor Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a high sense of patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Excuse us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming. We appreciate it.
Not exactly.
I miss hearing her every day, stop corruption.
You are a very brave man, you're not afraid of anything.
Please say it, just once.
God bless you, I
Is it a cigarette? Just say "stop corruption," please.
He's begging you, just record it for him, just once.
This is amazing.
Now, my dear
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and you are very dear to us.
We tried to reach you to inform you.
He was embarrassing you in front of people.
Are you serious?
Everyone said there were no job openings.
They actually wanted to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now, how are you going to save money for you and your mother?
And don't forget that.
And she has four children.
God helps you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'd accept any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
Just you, you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister is going to think about it.
Surely he sees it that way.
You are right.
Okay, it's serious.
We need to do something.
They say he's going to replace you. Do you know how damaging a rumor like that can be?
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind them.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh stopping corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He takes care of that.
We miss your voice.
No good
I am one of your biggest fans.
Salih is a very kind man.
And God willing, soon.
He'll be back, and we'll enjoy hearing his voice.
Even Bou Fahad himself asks about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you leave?
I had some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are diligent.
I haven't heard that in a long time.
"What is the most beautiful, please, Saleh?"
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Saleh says he agrees.
No, guys, the topic is really very difficult.
What's wrong with you?
The man is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I had already left.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job?
Well, this is your chance.
Satisfy him and let him hear your voice, and go ask him for a job the next day.
Sure, he will speed up for you.
I want what's best for you.
Do you know what?
Forget it, go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Present %pw Wait, man, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay
Alright, if I speak this one last time now, I'll quit but I'll do it this one last time.
What does Bu Fahd like to listen to?
What's the problem that concerns him the most? You know, there are many problems here.
What does he prefer to listen to? Not the commotion, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Seven and eighty bears = centimeter
He messed it up.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is issue seven? Issue seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, the minister.
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
His brother's car garage
Hey everyone, stop corruption.
From the day you returned, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a dear people, meaning, this is the last time.
Because, frankly, I had left.
Mom, you said he resigned, and you fired him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man who stopped corruption, they talked about him on the radio.
I didn't hear it from him, but some people told me that
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
Get rid of it.
He is free.
Present, Minister
Don't worry.
My whole day is dedicated to serving the ministry, may God bless you.
Did you hear him?
I only said it for you.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdulrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are so poor, Saleh.
I sympathize with you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all this.
Bu Fahad will never hire you.
You're going to do the same thing to him.
As long as you're known.
No one will hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for the divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we can't.
We never have problems.
We are happy.
What is nepotism?
Everyone is standing in line.
Because that's the system here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We rely on foreigners.
We don't have this.
Your effort and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And I'll expel you.
We don't have this here.
With my regards
Salih Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Baharani
Known as the Corruption Stoppage
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running and pulling at my shirt, tearing it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Walid saw you wearing the shirt we bought from Villaggio.
Torn with jealousy, he shredded it.
He's kind-hearted, he can't bear to scold.
I think
You, Adoul, saw my child as sweet and became jealous of him.
It's none of his business.
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
"You saw him wearing a new shirt and changed your mind, ask your father to buy you one too."
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you.
Don't force yourself to hit.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little kid, not your age, have a little decency.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to raise and fix him.
Not just the left.
Respect your word, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, so you can fix me.
You are arrogant.
Raise your child well.
And if you cannot do that
I respect him.
I don't want to upset him in front of his wife.
And the brothers.
If they return, they will defeat Waleed again.
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time arguing with you.
Discipline yourself.
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools
Where are the days of the past?
The intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this one is the biggest.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the problem we're in.
What happened, my love? Tell me.
My brother Ahmed, excuse me, I have to go home. There's something important I need to attend to.
Adoul's pants are gone.
He is a vindictive and hate-filled person.
He... He is a sultan.
How did the child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I didn't use them, God is sufficient.
Buried him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If I go and talk to him, he won't confess. He'll say it's the child.
What should we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
Just tell me.
Where did you put the scissors, dear?
Under his bed.
They destroy cities, may God destroy their lives.
I'll just show him.
I won't be silent.
He is crazy, reckless.
Currently
And don't change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show him.
I won't be silent.
Do you think it was Adel who ruined their computer?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
No *
Go and play with someone else, maybe your friends aren't me.
I told you it's Advil.
And laugh at someone else, oh! Panthers, not me.
Alive, come here please.
The hearts were good.
The intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm going to go look for friends.
He laughs at me, not I, oh! Sultan.
He falsely accuses me.
Hold this pair of scissors.
Act politely.
Hello, Abdurrahman, come quickly, boy!
Come and see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, boy!
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We must be.
Think deeply about our actions.
The works of the people who came before us
Let's see.
It will be a lesson for us.
We need to learn from them.
Don't behave like children this way.
As big as a camel.
Do you have children?
Without any knowledge
You are his role model, not them.
This model is his father.
You, Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
Bendable
I'll make him pay for the computer.
You shook his hand.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, I just shook his hand to get away.
"Abdulrahman's endless chatter."
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Have you made tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Didn't I say that Abdurrahman made peace between you two?
Alright, by God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
Bourhan, take the tea.
On his head
Quiet, quiet, stop! Boys, have you no shame, hitting each other like that?
You're behaving like little children, stop it, boy!
I swear I'll show you.
Hit, hit, oh! Boy, a big hit!
Blood, mother
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
Shame
Even though I reconciled you with each other.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile with them.
He didn't have time, girl!
Poor thing.
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
Okay, girls!
May God guide you.
You need to calm them down.
Don't provoke them to fight each other, girls!
What happened? God willing, it's good.
You disappointed me, Abdurrahman!
I wanted your help, not for you to do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, my son. May God guide you.
Two hits in a row.
*Stretch your arm*
You've embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Ah! Officer, we've told him again and again.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Excuse me.
Don't do it.
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
Means very far away.
My brother was right when he said it's password protected.
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed, your children won't do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
May God bless you, my brother, may God bless you.
Officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is the assistant the ministry's agent?
The one in the text is the head of a public authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Benadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
God is sufficient against the enemy.
God is sufficient against the enemy.
May God protect you from the enemy, they have tired me out.
"What is this? What %pw"
The boy throws to this distance!
This is an adult's hand, it seems to be his father's.
Can you believe it?
He seems to come from a respectable family, he's kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
What's up?
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say you didn't get the chance.
When I passed by her, she looked at you, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head at the same time.
No, but there must be something.
I notice when you enter.
She seems happy, from her pure heart.
Go ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Guys, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we sat down and talked like this.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to spend with you.
But you need to go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were very tired, working hours %, I told the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend time with my family.
God helps you.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have his friend's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has now been sold and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and filming.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, we won't interfere.
Good morning, uncle.
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems like it's the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you with good.
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough, men.
Take it.
What's your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
The neighbor comes before the house.
I want to take a picture with my father.
So my colleagues will believe me.
I couldn't believe our house was next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Talk to him to make him believe.
Oh life
What we used to see on television.
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor has become a believer, praise be to God, praise be to Allah.
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but guys, make it easy on me, I'm still not very used to it.
Have you heard about him?
That was kind of him, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
It was confirmed that some staff will be relocated to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan.
Did they tell you who's moving?
I didn't hear the names.
Okay, what I heard and am sure of.
Is Bouali one of them?
My name!
We just don't know exactly who we're going to transfer.
I can't go, bless you, smoke is bad for me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, the work is the work, man.
The committee is still studying the subject.
Only if they choose you.
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Waleed. Please stay a while.
Thank you, thank you, oh! Bou Ali
Please forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
This is very kind of you, Abu Walid!
May God reward you, Abu Waleed!
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever.
Enough, my daughter!
I'm ready to walk around the market for you until you find the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you before,
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
May I never cry over you again.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to make her angry when she called me yesterday.
Not to tire you out.
No more.
I'll talk to you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
And I'll give you the green light to show them to me.
I told you.
No, Mom, don't worry.
And you'll come and ask me to give you a show.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you feel like having dinner.
The driver is going to take her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people, they love good.
Yes, you are right, Dad!
Even our relatives don't do that to us.
Sure! Is my name mentioned?
Are you sure?
What a problem! Why do problems keep following us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, when I heard this news, what should I do, I don't know.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What happened, Abu Ali!
The committee met today.
And the list of names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is mentioned.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Umm Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he told me it's impossible.
Famous actor
Consider your name wasn't on the list.
God have mercy on you, many thanks, Abu Salem.
If you don't mind.
I want to take a picture with you so I can show it to my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a photo with you, actor?
Sure, God bless you.
Come, please. Come.
Sure, I'm happy to help you.
You and whom you love
Teach me a couple of days ago.
Mom, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said, "I have no objection."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
Enough, my son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You have to be fashionable.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You got me into trouble.
Why are you taking out all these jewels? This is the first time I've seen you do this.
It's not to me.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali is going to find a bride for her son.
She wants some chic clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and wealthy people.
(Surprise) God willing
Lucky she is.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and blonder.
Inshallah, I hear.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You need to be ready after this.
They're going to ask you to meet her father.
I'm sure I won't go in these clothes.
When I put on my new clothes
Mom, be careful with her things.
It's kind of Um Waleed to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So we have to be like them, in my opinion.
Why didn't his mother go to arrange his marriage?
That was for the women.
I have to go and meet the men.
As you can see, God bless you.
Only the bisht is left, God bless you.
Kind people, they helped me.
They were helpful, but the pesht is all that remains.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the look.
Everyone stands up for you.
Oh, brother Rashid, should I do it like this, or hold it?
No, see, first
You need to press this button.
I'm holding myself back.
The garment (men's clothing) is wide, but
God bless you.
The left hand needs to be in.
The right hand is relaxed, like this.
You hold the bisht from the bottom.
Wow, wow
How wonderful!
You need to slow down a bit.
Oh! PW, yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand, like this, your left hand, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's her deal?
Do you know what she was telling me this morning?
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be far from each other."
At my brother's request, I'm proposing to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and not to embarrass himself or her.
I see many suitors are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad wanted you for her uncle, and today she wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I'm just sitting and watching.
Do they know about our relationship?
No, they just know we're colleagues.
Okay, then.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
You reject my son Waleed.
The actors are more honest than you, two-face!
Just you.
You act your whole life long.
This doesn't reflect on you.
Serving people
He lies to people.
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
Me neither!
I wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Plays
You are getting married.
What scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He is wearing his headscarf over the sides of his face.
What doesn't turn its death neither to the left nor to the right.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works in the same office as you.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why isn't it working?
As they said,
God help him, man!
Keep walking, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the look of the city center.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look good when you're sitting.
You look better when you wake up, when you stop, stop, stop.
I beg you, Thursday!
How are you? Are you going to the city center?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
Are you happy with this!
Oh! Thursday
Play it, and if the host is a woman.
I change the channel because I'm afraid it will get me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
Sitting with Salem, my work friend.
Talk to her.
She hung up on me, take it, take it.
I hung up, now you're going to bother me.
Now you're saying I made you talk to her because there's someone among us.
Now can you kick me out of the house?
Get out!
You're not the first one to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! My brother!
I don't want to trouble my mother in her grave.
He entrusted me with the task.
She said, "Don't shoot."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what the problem is.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say such things about him.
Salem, in particular, is one of the best men in our city.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, am I stupid to get divorced? This is unbelievable.
Thursday, I officially went crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
Poor man, his heart is broken.
My father gave him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?
No, nothing, nothing
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
The subject is about the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you sleeping today?
Hello Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm really talking to you consciously.
Oh! Brother!
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we erase your name?
The only one who can erase your name is the Honorable Minister.
It's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Step by step, safe and sound, I swear he was safe.
If you were talking to Salem
Are you going to speak?
That lie won't fly.
Don't lie! Oh! Five.
Do you tell the truth?
You're wearing casual clothes.
She thought I was talking to a woman.
Oh, what a miserable life.
God bless you, please greet Salem.
Please, to be believable.
He asked you to call.
None of your business.
Don't interfere in other people's affairs, or you'll see something unpleasant.
They complain about you.
Hey!? Yes, you!
How can you bear to live with a woman whose tongue is so sharp?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hasan is going to call Khamis.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start
Let's hope he finds it.
He was once afraid when he saw the women.
I looked all over the ministry and you were hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the meeting room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh! Thursday, how do you know your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
"*Oh my God* You want to make her suspect me, don't you understand?"
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Is your wife going to call at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which your company will implement for our ministry
It is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Guys, why is the table shaking?
No, I'm not tall, not the table, me.
Can you return your call?
Who is this?
Excuse me, who do you want to speak with?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait
He fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that his wife told him not to come home unless he changes his job and doesn't work with girls.
That's why I sent a message to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it. What more does he want!
What's the deal with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him who he is talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What are you planning to do! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you did what she wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, that's what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And God willing, we'll agree, if you accept, God willing, I'll be back home tonight.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He starts working in the new department tomorrow.
It means an office and a job, different from the one he used to work in.
Where is this section, may God bless you?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister's permit.
Nothing, nothing, that's it, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saud, and Abdulqadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you ask for directions?
The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can execute a second decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Brother, make a deal with your colleagues.
And address them by male names, so your wife won't know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office asked about a man who works with us.
Are you serious!
He laughs, poor man, working among five women, he laughs.
They say his wife is very jealous of the women around him.
Blind jealousy
Poor man, he is in need.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, and we complied and didn't speak.
Ah, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
See if it fits you.
My son called, said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Walk straight, it's the first door on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With the five ***
These are six employees.
And these guys here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
God guide you, Sultan!
We just want to know what stage we've reached.
My uncle, Saqr, and I were at the bank yesterday.
The project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and ready to go out.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And the scorpion's bite is painful.
This is important for the cold, see see.
Look, uncle.
Aisha, please call the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
So the meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's not something serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must implement it.
They need to understand that you're an important supervisor.
They have many responsibilities and obligations.
They consider women as servants.
I've never seen people hate women as much as they do.
At what age do they think they're living?
They asked me not to go to work today, and instead go to the kitchen and make tea.
Where are the servants?
And the second one fled a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their insults.
I understand them.
God helps you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Well, they mean it.
In fact, the villa complex has no value without a garden.
Okay, now, the park...
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My love, Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or die.
And I play it at school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
Do you know if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good?
You are responsible for what happened.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me, it's been a long time since I last saw you.
It's been a year now, a year since I saw you.
Is he married yet?
"May God guide you."
Who would agree to marry my mother without a certificate?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if my mother is a man.
And Thursday is the day of the scorpions.
The scorpion's sting is painful.
And then he has to marry from the same social class.
A scorpion like him.
God helps you.
What can I do, Aisha!
Ever since the minister traveled, all the documents have been reaching me.
I informed Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
And now I'm free to talk to you, Ayesha!
Yes, Mary.
Present, here, present, here now
I can't say! Oh! Aisha
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
No problem, my dear. Ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
Why did we warn her not to go and talk to them about the matter?
She went to them, and they beat her.
Do you know if I tell them it's soccer?
They beat you a long time ago.
What a pity, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The Big Scorpion
That little one
What? Uncle, I didn't hit her, it was Sultan who hit her.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't be greedy.
Well, scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the scholarship office.
And cross out architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke to Sultan and I will read.
They don't mind you marrying Munira.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Thursday deserves all the good.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to be with the delegation.
I appreciate your personal circumstances.
Just give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Frankly,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's true.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I'm surprised.
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
And I provide for the house.
She wants me to accompany her on the trip.
Aren't we getting married this week?
What do you say?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Marry and travel with him.
Okay, let's go.
This is a flaw.
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh! My son, I've told you many times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
What can you expect, he's a Scorpio.
Appearance is what matters.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
And go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
Madrid and Barcelona match tonight.
I hope Valencia doesn't beat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and works hard.
What's your opinion on this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God prolong your life.
Long life
Serve coffee there.
Her happiness.
May God prolong her life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Highness
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Did you wash the coffee cup?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We will play in China after tomorrow.
Oh captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
I'm going to the official engagement.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw.
Yes, ma'am.
Pour and make a new one.
Actors' conversations
You know, after Mashael called me a few minutes ago
What can I say to her?
This is unfortunate, Dar Nouf doesn't suit Mashael.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And it's clear that Mashael is in her twenties.
Okay, why don't you take Mary's role?
Suits her better.
November to Thirty
We need to get rid of the demanding person on the committee.
He's a problematic person, I'm sure he won't let things go smoothly.
He is very precise.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, and more.
Who chose him for the committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hamed can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company is registered in the name of Hamed's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about this.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, guys, everything is fine, please come in.
I just spoke to them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
It is produced by the Modern Touch Arts Institute.
It's a beautiful, unusual, and bold action series.
I agree with Hamed.
The story of the series is very sweet.
I agree with you.
I liked it when you took the gun and killed your neighbor.
She was going to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And she didn't know that it was her son's right, it was exciting, and when the police came
And her son comes from school.
And kick the box.
He kicked him and he flew into his mother's lap.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box is inside the mother's room.
It's good that a local company produces this advanced level of output.
We need to encourage and support them.
Professor Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and reflections on the series, this is "conscience extortion."
And the extraction of human values
Disgusting surprises
One person and one text per episode.
The second text is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
What carries a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why do you have to make the viewers cry?
Excuse me, Rashid.
You've given us your opinion, Ali gave us his, now let Mr. Rashid express his.
Clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you.
You organized it.
Some people understand, and this is their field, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I don't agree with that series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Madame Samira.
I don't know what to do.
How true! Oh! Nasser
This is for the new series we'll be producing soon.
What makes the driver rape the girl?
For the blessed things we got because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'm telling you how.
So they presented it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
Sweet dream
I played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
Blackmail is called something, I just can't remember what.
Ah, extortion dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
Last year's TV series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are very beloved.
Lucky you.
Yes, Omar.
Okay, fine.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
"Be generous and relieve."
He said he wants to see me about a very urgent and important matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
He spent half an hour with him.
And you said you would bother him.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and wants to meet me.
I'm still afraid the minister will believe him.
I'm meeting with the minister.
The man came to explain his viewpoint about the series.
This is all.
This is true, may you live a longer life.
But first of all, Your Highness, I must say that it is not acceptable to speak ill of a colleague behind their back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He's jealous of everyone around him.
He only cares about financial interests.
That's just his specialty.
Just, God bless you, not every educated person can handle these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
Exorcism of the conscience, the series we're working on.
It's a blockbuster.
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your field, you know more about it than I do.
I promise you an amazing series.
This will defend our name.
Look what the journalist, Abdul Hamid, wrote. Listen, listen.
Later, one of the actors said
The series promotes unethical ideas.
This is limited by the decline of literature.
This is indeed a very bold and strong criticism.
They'll be in big trouble if the journalist, Abdelhamid, keeps writing about them.
And if the people I hold accountable know about the subject.
But they are also smart, they know how to handle her.
They are cranes.
We need to create our own website.
And list all the activities of our company.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The series "Conscience Exortion," overseen by Mercury Media Production, is considered to be
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries moral values and ideas.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
He's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible that he might change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept this?
The journalist Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Professor Hamed.
He asked me, "What do you think of the series?" I replied, "It's going to be the best in the Arab world."
Inshallah
I feel like our series is going to be really awesome.
I don't know where he is.
The second one is getting ready and prepared to go.
Not an interesting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
Clear at first glance
Your book is interesting.
*Mumkin yusir* (Possible to happen)
Cyrillic is stupid, stupid
What do you think?
This is very tragic.
Second-rate series are no excuse.
I can understand this production from the first time.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, someone needs to focus to discover them.
By the way, this is a political drama.
It's a shame he was seen.
What's the problem?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is upset, that's a big problem.
In just one week, we'll all be fired.
What a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid intends to visit him.
And tell him that the series is a failure and there's no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser intends to do.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Ellie, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that didn't just criticize the production, but cursed it.
Don't make me angry.
Sorry
That day I was free.
I'm never going to let them write that.
But honestly, I didn't receive any praise messages.
Once again, great success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Pressing the conscience is the best television production.
May you live longer, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the second newspaper wrote.
Do they still have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I was about to have a heart attack.
After a while, they told me.
Lucky, the minister is satisfied.
Frankly, Nasser,
Be ready to see the exploitation of conscience 2
No, no, no, no, enough, brother.
The series, he said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part II, After All These Problems
Third and fourth as well.
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can the magician do?
I wish you more success.
Please tell us your opinion on this success.
I thank God for this success.
They are haters and enemies of our success.
I find it strange.
This series wins awards, yet it's a failure.
Only experts.
They awarded her the prizes; they must see what we can't see.
Prepare the second part of the series.
Well, may your life be long.
A real wizard.
You will see, "exploitation of conscience" is coming.
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
The same thing
They are taken to the bank to be washed and made clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch.
They nominate him at Arab and Gulf festivals.
He cleans it and gives it awards so that people consider it high-class.
Yes, that's right.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God, I have arrived.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We're not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We're not going to release it.
Otherwise, we'll cancel the contract.
We already signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company.
WWAB
As you like it.
Did a really great job.
He will be the first one in the world to produce this product.
He's not just the best baker in the world.
I'm telling you.
How is the bread with a weevil?
You can open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and the knife might hurt your hand.
So he made zipper bread.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, this is a pair of pants.
What do you think, actually, this is a bag of bread.
How can we remove that zipper?
If so, he can tell his friend, "I've eaten two clouds."
Why didn't the Noor Mountains Hospital pastries arrive yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make it.
Once again, use the bakers.
That's what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with soccer and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
What's the problem if a few employees from the company get together to have fun?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven main players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
Team spokesperson
Why are you upset with him?
For now, everything is fine. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and they are the twelfth player.
I let you enjoy yourself with them.
And we've already signed a contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
He heard you.
Didn't do anything.
No, you're upset with him only because he had some employees play football in front of him and have fun.
I said he couldn't take some of the employees.
Even if some of your friends need staff, you can lend them some.
Important bakers
Hey boy, why are you taking the important bakers? That's not right.
Next time, teach me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi do these papers.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they tell you?
I finished my work, and I'm in my car.
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find the goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
*He said, "Let's look for a goalkeeper," and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's suit.
I didn't play soccer, nor did I touch the ball.
That situation
This is stupid.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain to you.
Dad, you want me to cancel and disband the team, right?
Yes, that's correct.
Present, Father, please, I beg you.
I can't empty the team, tomorrow's the final match.
No, no, no, it's true.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on your victory.
Congratulations, Professor Nasser, on your cup victory.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
See, I prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as we promised.
It seems your father is happy.
I'm afraid he's just trying to be nice and polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
This very great success.
God bless you, no, no, no.
There's no picture without the thobe (traditional Arab men's cloak), wait, wait, stay still.
No, no
He is wearing the bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative ideas played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan
But, they played with a 5-5-3-2 formation in the final.
And as a player, you know that changing the team's strategy confuses the players, yet Baker's team was not confused and did an excellent job.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first player on the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest the players do?
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome, is Hamad Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
This is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
"You se
I've wanted to know him for a long time.
Football introduced me to him. I told him this.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz."
I've been interested in football all my life.
What do you have to do with the subject?
The ball was always close to me, but there were fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, he hasn't come today yet.
There's a seminar on football injuries, he's the platinum sponsor, he has to be there.
You see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview someone in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What's the news about the International Bakery Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
This is a small amount, but a million dollars for all this effort.
No, man, be generous.
It's not my fault, brother Shahin.
My mistake.
What was my mistake?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
The prices for the Gulf are very expensive.
So if the player's price is two thousand
For the gulf, it costs three or four million dollars.
I didn't understand it, explain it to me.
Get my fax from here.
And read it to me when you're with me.
Dad bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily beat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it says eight hundred thousand on it.
Yes, that's right, God bless you, but Turkish Club set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we inspect the goods?
Here
Calf's leg
Okay, good.
No, no, no, I can't guarantee that to you.
He is fat, God willing, praise be to God, he is fat.
This one is slim, suitable for the middle.
The muscle connection
It's the most important muscle, a player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Tell your driver to take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, I said! Automatic.
How do you mean?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yeah, we'll bring them from the jungles of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, and then release them into the wild.
"You're welcome to take it. Do you have space for it, or should I put it in the pickup truck?"
When he saw them pressuring us
The forward player was asked to play.
"Kakakano makalali dande, la" translates to "It's not easy to make a living, indeed."
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I love how he runs the game.
This has to be on the north road.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you screaming?
Your stupid son
He's not convinced that the coach is an expert in football.
Listen to her, she speaks like Mitsu.
He knows that the offensive player Selolo Tekawa is a good central player, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one gives you a headache.
Just stay away.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team should consider changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
And player Takulamakakolalalo is in the wrong place, he needs to be moved to his usual position.
Ask the coach to change the...
To separate the wheat from the chaff.
Okay, okay, okay.
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This is what should happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please defer these issues until the game is over.
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This coach is stubborn.
Tell him, Uncle Abu Nasser doesn't want you as a coach for his team anymore.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the match on TV and you're the substitute, do what I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how can we play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me, tell me what's wrong?
He divorced me, Mom, he divorced me.
"I divorced you! How did that happen?"
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
"I swear, mother, I don't know, I really don't know."
He divorced you without a reason!
Yes, Mama, yes.
"I swear, Mama, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me, 'Go to your parents' house'."
I asked him why he did that. He said, "You're divorced."
I swear to God, I don't know what's happening?
They only married for one month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I just know he divorced her, right now.
Sit down. I'll be right back.
Because of her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she had insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to and respects that team.
I insulted him and hurt his feelings.
My mother insulted Barcelona, and I told him to divorce her and find a second wife.
You tell him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Seriously, that's why he divorced her?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife plants a dagger in her husband's loyalty.
How true what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time, she started mocking Messi.
Problems between a couple happen, and we need to be prepared.
Instead of being alone, there are a thousand girls.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And by God, don't interfere. He is my son and I know him well.
I told you, it's none of your business.
I'm angry with you.
Don't tire yourself, boy, and don't think about it.
One bad apple spoils the barrel.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words.
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Present, my love.
What's wrong with it!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for a month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you won't stop laughing.
To share it with you, we need your attention.
What's the use of a person like this, who divorces his wife for a football team?
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to get into trouble with this person.
That is, you're listening to the barbers' idle talk.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her heresies and say what she wants.
Wealth is coming to her.
I told her, "Oh! Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it were only her wealth, I wouldn't care at all.
But she's going to stop her luck and ours with her.
This building
He couldn't say no to me.
God is sufficient against this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Do not listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand, don't close the door of luck that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You must be joking. Can you believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all this nonsense and don't go crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And maybe she is the reason or there is something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Borgain slip through your fingers.
What's this, Abu Burgin?
But when they get closer, they realize it's two towers.
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Burgin.
God bless you.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Go ahead.
May God grant you a long life, they already took the money, you signed and they spent it.
Your Highness, I was worried and it seems you were very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, he is divorced.
He was married and divorced as well.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, brother, be firm with him.
Oh man! This is a tough generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, girl.
My daughter, don't forget your fruit, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when you ride the plane.
When you reach London
Hey boy, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mom.
Okay, that's good.
So you can come with us and shop as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I'm asking her and I have no idea what's going on.
Tell me, girl, what happened?
I did the right thing by ignoring her.
They are not worth anything.
On your honeymoon, she is supposed to take care of you in every way.
Is it logical that it's a rule and you're pouring the water!
And the cup is next to you, it doesn't lift itself to make you drink.
She was brought up well.
You should have told her from the day she was born, I only drink water from my mother's hands.
What's in it?
She looks very sad.
And who is this lady with her?
Her name is Michelle.
Poor thing, she got divorced on her honeymoon.
Would you believe me if I told you her story?
God bless you, auntie. Thank you.
Your aunt asked, and also your uncles.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Hello, Mother.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
Frankly, this is nonsense.
Where is the light?
She's in her room talking to that idiot.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone has been turned off.
I just found it now.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired and wanting to rest.
Every day I tell my mom to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. She upsets me every day.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin on.
She peels the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You're divorced.
And one more thing when necessary.
Come on, my light.
Come on, my light.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still sad!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Shut up, God bless you.
I don't know, mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
Right, he has nothing to say.
She will dance twice or three times.
And if he divorces my daughter, he dies.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to vent my anger on this rude man.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are your game and your son's.
They don't have families and mothers to taste the bitterness in their mouths.
The one you're mocking.
And set them free as you like.
She's the one who helped you drink water, she insults Barcelona, divorce her and forget about her.
Who went to a nightclub?
Without shame or modesty
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Stay where you are and don't move.
Be a little human.
It was my father's right.
Who sells land like this?
Abu Sakr took it from Abu Bjdarah.
Why did he sell it?
God guide you, if Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Please, go ahead.
Come on, come on.
What happened with your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to the bookstore?
I told you, if you want to run your project, you need to start paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
%pw is what he eats? Is there anyone in this world who doesn't eat?
This isn't a problem, brother. We'll make him eat and feel full, and fill his stomach. The problem is how to reach him.
And you must know Abu Sakkar's key, to open all the doors for you.
I meet him during the Umrah pilgrimage and greet him more than once.
All you need to know is as long as you pay him and do your job, all you need to know is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came right away.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Oh man, anyone.
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's so nice to stay at this farm overnight.
Yes, Your Honor, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car dealership behind the mall.
He wants to meet you, Your Highness.
Get the license.
He's like my son who got the license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
My job is going well.
This means you met him and talked to him easily.
Don't be stupid.
Okay, fair enough, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances were in my favor.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a gift, a falcon.
If the topic is about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, take me to him.
Yes, it happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He had his tonsils removed.
And he will certainly hold a feast.
You deserve your son's health over your honor!
We hope he improves, we hope he improves, God willing, may he not see any harm, God willing.
And we met some of them at the rosary shop.
I think so.
Oh men! We're starting to forget and our age is increasing.
They told me your son Shahin was in the room next door and left earlier.
I thought I should visit you.
And let us bless you with the health of Shahin.
Listen! You dishonor yourself by leaving without dining with us.
I'm not in the mood for it.
Just say yes or no.
Because our beloved son Shahin has been discharged from the hospital,
In my Corniche Tower.
Just say yes.
Oh! Boy, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a project without capital these days?
At the vehicle and crane agency, he said, "Just let him point."
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Masha'Allah, your father is loved by everyone, you just have to point him out.
Oh! You see, people take loans from banks to establish a company or a business venture.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is something new as well.
This is a falcon, the light of my eyes. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
He just took their agency yesterday.
"You se
He also told me that all businessmen are like you, may God make everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
Frankly, I love him.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Sakr, congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it so easily.
You, you can now say no.
What's up?
What do I need to say?
Be her partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
Who knows his father!
I told him I was a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I had work experience.
I said, "I have a bakery, thank God, I live off of it."
No, no, I don't like the name.
What I noticed.
No, brother! The name is not nice.
This is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Understood, my big bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, too, and the mercy and blessings of God. O your honor.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
Madam Judge, she just sent her car for maintenance and came to take mine because she is an advertising agent in a marketing company and she can't do anything without her car.
You might still need your car later.
No, I don't need the car today.
Present, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone needs to have sufficient knowledge in their field, regardless of what that field is.
Excellent! Oh, Dr. Sami!
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study business or economics.
He never read a book or even a newspaper in his entire life. I never saw him holding any paper in his hands.
You all know who Falcon is today.
I didn't want to get into this business and %pw, but...
His uncle Abu Nasser is here, still alive before you.
What he loves.
But some people are born for work and naturally love it.
You're right, Doctor!
God willing, Shahin, you will be like your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one can be like you, oh! Doctor.
Frankly.
How was it possible for Falcon, who hates trade, to easily reach this great economic feeling?
If today they count a hundred billionaires in the world, they count them among them.
Do you know Oh! Abu Saqr?
They chose Falcon for the Market Knights.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Eagle, wants to take over the car dealership from my father?
The agency is no longer yours.
People really don't get satisfied.
Dad helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to trade.
Frankly, the doctor said he is in critical condition.
This isn't going to work.
Nothing works.
Shocked or appalled, it's none of my business, I'm telling you to divorce her, divorce her and be done with it.
In the 21st century, there are people like these.
We meet, dear viewers, with one of the good and giving men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the needy and deprived.
And that's why we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Society.
Of course, if we're talking about this organization, O Honor.
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world, and of course to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
"Masha'Allah, may God honor you, may He preserve for you many people like you."
My wife and I just left the house.
My wife just spends half an hour opening her new project.
I'm waiting for her.
No problem.
Frankly, I love their atmosphere and I enjoy sitting with them. I really have a great time.
And it's also a source of income for my children.
He is my whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Okay, hot bread, hot bread.
Come on, guys!
In the 21st century, there is a people like this.
In the 21st century, there are people like this.
If someone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Long live Souq Waqif.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Praise be to God, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love comes from God.
I want to say something, but please just say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin must go to the exhibition and get the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The wind blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breeze, for love's sake, take me home.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anaud?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days, you idiot!
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes more time.
And if God wills, will you start talking to Al-Anood and ignore me?
How many flowers do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but my sister won't be angry.
What do you need more, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't let me forget about it.
Is my dress ready?
Here you go, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I'll stop by next week to pick up the dress, okay, bye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
God willing, today I went to Fadi at the store, he is doing an excellent job and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What's the problem?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong?
Look at the jealousy!
And we have not heard that he started a project, where does this bankrupt get the money from.
They open their mouths, they devour!
And he hasn't started his work yet.
Are you sure?
I heard some gossip.
And if God wills, won't you do anything?
It's 7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already eaten breakfast.
Okay, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you...
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these things, may God guide you, my cousin.
Design, women's fashion design and so on?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, just, I
You need advice, you need %pw. I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Thank you, cousin.
So forgive me, I have to go.
Go ahead, boss!
The first time you tell me if you need more.
Come on, oh! Fadi is arranging the shop, you're busy as I see?
The shop is no longer enough.
I said you should rent the shop next to us, have faith in God and take it.
God willing.
Have they rented the shop next to us?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Sayfi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a document at my friend's place. His name is Essam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and his name was written on it.
What's in it, what's in it, what's in it.
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? What's the problem? Is there a flaw in it?
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
I said I had to destroy him.
This market is open to everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a sheep herder? What is he saying?
I was testing you; I asked you, "Are you planning to start a project?"
I didn't lie to you, men.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your requests.
That won't get you there.
Oh men, this is life and everyone gets their share.
You beat me.
Come on, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer bag.
I'm a girl, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Oh! Madam, this is fantastic, no, no, no, this, this is unparalleled in all of Doha.
Oh, that suits you, madam. With such sweet talk and a piece worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty or forty thousand.
Yes, just do like him.
As you know, the wardrobe I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Oh! Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unparalleled in all of Doha.
See, if you want to be successful
What's exactly wrong with it?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the customers.
What do you think about moving to another place, boss!
No thanks, no thanks Fadi.
And at this time, they will play by themselves.
It means we lost, no!
We have to confront them!
And let's bring our customers back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything.
But the most important thing is that he won't defeat me.
This dress I chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course without the buttons in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
And I put crystal on it. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are globally renowned.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's happening? What's wrong?
Hurt us, Saad, hurt us.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we have no more customers.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We're not going to sit and watch!
We need to confront them as they confront us, and we also need to respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
And I'll start a war against them and see what they do.
Abu Nasser isn't going to stop her.
Check the ad!
Check the ad you've posted!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
She made four evening dresses to go with each wedding dress.
We publish an ad in a quarter page.
See, he published a half-page ad.
I have no idea what he was planning to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their shop.
No, and this afternoon they didn't open, they locked up.
And you'll hear that he put his shop up for sale.
By killing him, I kill him.
Even they can't sit there, so he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea, may God guide you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Does anyone bear a grudge against you?
There's one person, may God bless him, who intentionally sprayed this scent around the place.
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You're cousins, you're adults, not kids, so don't fight like children.
He came at night and sprayed a bad smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything with your scent.
Do not cross the line.
You signed a pledge at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I prepared a hellish plane for him.
No one caught me, and I was wrong.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear, I don't know what's happening. This is the fourth day in a row that not a single customer has come to our store.
Oh no, this isn't the right place, we have to go to the other store, I've shown my face, God guide you.
What did the doctor say to you?
The shop is empty and no customers are entering.
I don't know, it's like they did magic to him.
Women and girls are not allowed near the shop.
As if a spell had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go and see it, brother, go back, I'm afraid the roof will collapse.
You're lost, Sultan, you're lost.
I don't know, he turned it into a dog!
He did it like a beast!
Calm down, brother. Don't be angry.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? His friends say they've started collecting money to pay off his debts.
Designed
I'm Lebanese.
I told him, didn't I?
Don't you know where he is?
The stars are the same, and we are desperately searching for those extras.
Call the boy again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed!
What's wrong with you, Ahmed! You're just sitting there while the manager is yelling at me! What should I do? Where are those damn extras you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone. I called him and got a headache. Even ask Mr. Abdullah.
First, don't scream. We're actors and we want to rest a bit. We need to focus on our roles. Second, the man called more than once in front of me, but calm down.
What do you say, Professor Abdullah, what do you say?
Oh! Professor Abdullah, what should I do now? The director is going to finish the scene and he's going to be mad at me.
Alright oh! Guys, alright oh! Guys.
We just want to finish, but these extras who are supposed to be in the scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want anyone to upset you, right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our state, screaming from morning till night. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about casting yourself in the lead role? Hopefully, I can get an actor to do a good job with the part.
It's true that he's going to act in just one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Please, sir, just go and shoot now.
But if you're not ready today, I'll leave.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
I'm telling you something, in Filipino, okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he'll leave right away. He needs someone who looks elite, it has to be elite and Qatari.
Guys, I'll wear a gutra and agal, no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out. This is production work, respect people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distribute the tasks and you'll be comfortable.
Calm down, so we can think. Reim, think with me, maybe you'll remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember someone in the Salata neighborhood named Saud Boukarn?
The same as Saudi sidr.
%PW Say Saudi cans!
The manager said he needs a rich and influential man, and you're saying cans.
Dear, at the end of the day it's an extra role, you're going to bring in a rich and respected man for an extra role.
Just with a little makeup, Reem and I will wear abayas and clean thobes and a luxurious car.
Insha'Allah, it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Happy scanning?
So who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
Yes, that's it, thank you very much.
And now how am I supposed to work, Mama? There's nothing but this trio that Uncle brought from abroad.
Son, you only have what you're wearing.
Son, this is inside the cabinet under my clothes.
Mom, there are people outside, what do you want me to iron?
God help you, boy.
This means that today I'll be following you and you'll be on television.
Yes, Mom. They said I'm going to be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you coward.
Come on, guys. What's this? Spitting on you.
Spray, spray.
Here it is, Mom.
Quickly, Mama, do you feel better?
God willing, son.
God forbid, hopefully they'll give you some money.
God help you.
Pray for me.
I'll get you Saudi cans, Saudi laptops.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abboud, Fatima's son, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Is he going to do the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, God willing, he'll do a good job. Calm down and stay calm so they'll give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is doing.
She's not the same person who used to gather thorns like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, just be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, I regret nominating you.
The person they brought in to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
He's here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Ghafel Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Oh brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager tells you.
Oh brother! Oh brother, please, you're playing the role of an elite, one of the rich, got it or not?
Come here, boy! Come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is too light, the role needs a serious person.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak this way.
"Brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen, I'll come get you now and take you to the makeup room, and I'll rehearse you for the role."
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Hey boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saud, he's cleaning everything and organizing it.
Let's repeat it again, and the assistant manager is here to see you and assure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You're saying this?
Yes, yes, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect that from you! Oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Beautiful, and you need to know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother.
He is cleaning and completing the full name Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzook, nice.
Sweet, go ahead, go ahead and think.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't worry about why he divorced her.
Your daughter is divorced, is she pretty? Is she pretty?
She's sweet, go ahead and consider yourself, we don't get married.
Why don't I spit on him?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let %pw clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Guys, the homeowners surprised us and they need the hall, so the director decided to finish the indoor scenes in the hall and then we'll shoot the outdoor scenes.
How is this? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they really do, but it's been postponed to another time. They're going to film another scene and we'll be right behind them, God willing.
I'll tell them to get you some tea.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe do you belong to, boy?
My name, Your Honor, is Salem Abu Shwe Shwe.
The Shawys are famous.
You deserve it.
Tickle me, I have a big nose and lips that can go here.
Tell me, my brother, about people who have thin noses nowadays.
I hold myself.
If it were someone else, he wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mom.
My mother is very sick, I need to go quickly, brother!
You're going to wear these clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she's very tired and he keeps saying!
Listen, you can do that, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't leave the place.
Okay, okay, I'll try to find a taxi. Oh! Brother.
Which taxi? If you try to look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
We rented the car for the scene.
As long as it's parked, take it.
Oh! Brother, please give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
She's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Wait, wait, I'll bring the wheelchair now, now oh! Sir.
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very tired in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? In the car?
Oh! Boy, what happened?
Stay quiet and don't speak, just watch and be silent.
Peace be upon you.
Nothing's wrong, but my mom, your lady, has asthma, quickly.
I'm telling them to make the bed.
Okay, okay.
Don't bother.
God is sufficient for you. What have you done?
Cool! Rashid.
Take care of our son Rashid.
Suit yourself, come with me, Professor Rashid.
Come with me, Professor Rashid.
And Mr. Rashid will take him and do what is necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what you want to drink, Your Highness.
Come with me, Professor Rashid.
Excuse me.
What should I do, there are a lot of people, but wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first one. Nasser, the hospital security guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
No one even gives me attention.
They philosophize and they demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, he didn't marry your mother, what's this, he didn't marry your mother! Go find your own kind.
Oh brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
Oh, brother, I can't! My heart is attached.
Your brother has fallen in love, believe it, when I see her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God curse you.
Your Honor, our aunt is now in perfect health.
You are a professional actor Oh! Saud, oh! Guys, come here!
Bravo, see how they applauded you and praised you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Guys, forget about it. Come and sigh for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget about this and write Saud.
Saud has passed away.
From now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzouk, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
Buffet one!
I made two.
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so classy. I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
My love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mama.
I need to get them something for the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
What's wrong with you, mother?
Look at your brother who's going to disgrace us!
Oh my, this is embarrassing. By the way, it's cheap.
But that depends on our budget.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
It's good that I saw her.
This type is the free category, dedicated to the sophisticated community.
Approximately above average.
No, we want something extraordinary, something no one else can do.
Sorry, ma'am, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities.
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What luxury, so advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I am at your service, I am at your service.
I'm coming for you.
They booked the small hall and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What did she say about Saeed's wedding?
Sure, everyone is saying the same thing.
That's what scares me!
My dear sister,
He's just worried about the money.
He cares about what people say.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
But we should get something according to our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take out loans and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and stop people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, the cheap chocolate is enough to embarrass us.
I said the manager liked the Chinese food and took it home with him.
Alright, if the bride's family says that we choose the hall, the stage, and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we choose anything!
No, not really, but the store we used to go to had very reasonable prices.
By the way, this store designed Abu Zahab's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, just once.
At Azza's daughter's wedding, congratulations.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
I need a platform that we will be the first people in the world to use.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This phase is being used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and up-to-date.
How much is this stage with the second arrangements?
According to that, it's now at least one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, when we do this, our money won't be enough. Everything is so luxurious, the best and the premium, and all of this costs money.
Everyone does this.
Please be quiet.
What's the decision?
Did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, I don't need Noah's Ark.
This is the wedding and its costs. By the way, we are considered middle class.
Do I have to pay 150,000 on stage and 150,000 for the hall, the one you booked the royal hall as you call it?
I didn't say box, but why the show-off and everyone wanting to see the other and everyone wanting to do better than what others have done.
It's a battle of bragging rights, and no one benefits except the wedding hall owners.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they exploit us and lie to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding shop.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father says yes.
Okay, do something.
Like other young people who get married and manage on their own.
Hello Sheikh, your honor.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I'm calling you.
First time in Qatar, designed by the world artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With Noah Schip's stage, it's going to look fantastic.
In this harmony, you are the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay, then.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay, then.
May God give you patience.
As you like it.
These are a lot of expenses, brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd.
How can I solve this? Oh! Fahd, as long as we're boasting at weddings, we're in trouble.
Without any boasting.
Of course, you'll receive the invitations you want.
Yeah, this week, God willing, we'll start with the invitations.
Our marriage will be better than theirs.
Mama, look at the invitations that your son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitations, print them, and come back. And also Manar's family.
They went to France; even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
Fleesh, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some great invitations.
Frankly, it's expensive, that's all.
It's just unique and no one has done it before.
Shine, I love it.
Gold will be much better, it shines.
Oh! Brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did he get involved in the matter?
And get rid of all the boasting and showing off at weddings, and all the unnecessary expenses.
The only ones who benefit from our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he's going, God help him.
Let me get it, he might not find anyone to take it.
Alright, I'll let you go.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
Oh! Brother, the bride's family has to support you.
I tried once, just once.
I told them there was no need for a dance hall in a very well-known hotel.
Why, you found our daughter in the street, and others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is staring at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
The whole thing is about a simple party and some small expenses.
Come on, guys, these days they're having weddings on Facebook.
Cheaper and at a lower price.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You see,
If I don't get Abdullah Roaished or Nawal for my son's wedding.
Damn her, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If your father has a phone number, give it to us so we can contact him.
My love, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ. Why did you change your mind?
Is Umm Nصورr better than me?
I forgot who she is and who we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not it, Mom. Just look at my brother Saleh, he breaks my heart and we don't pressure him much.
Seriously, he broke my heart.
Oh, wow!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, it just happened suddenly.
I heard this and fell for it right away.
He had no reason and no one could blame her, after she had prepared everything and people knew, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's embarrassing us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
Oh! My son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, comfort her.
I swear, if I tell Abu Yusuf this, his heart will stop beating.
You know why the minister is still keeping Abu Youssef.
By the way, he was supposed to retire three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with it, he's helping me.
I swear, you're crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And make him hide the papers and statements until the money is returned.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're afraid.
There's nothing to worry about, and in the end, I'll return the amount to you.
Do you know my name, do you know my name?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Aunt, aunt, I tried, but there's no other way besides this one.
If I give it to you and the people who will come to review later,
They are strict in their scrutiny, they will take me quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, you ate the tablet.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we'll be in the hall receiving guests.
No, we'll definitely be there.
I'll throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Present, dear Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm worried about you. They're jealous of you, boy, if you walk in on them tomorrow like that with the bird.
So, Mom, is the length of the coat okay?
The police are here!
Inshallah, there's nothing wrong.
"The %Pw police, but stay here and I'll be back."
God is sufficient for you, Salouh.
Forget about your marriage.
Marriage cage, now he will enter the prison cage.
They found the document I hid for your loan, and suddenly they found me.
Why are you upset!
You're going to hear about much worse disasters than this.
What will we say then!
A respectful and honest employee
The one who loves his job, the ministry contracted a company for maintenance.
The employee, being diligent, went to inquire about the materials.
He found out it costs four hundred thousand.
He will provide the ministry with one million six hundred thousand.
And the minister punished him! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why can't you believe her!
Here is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He was fired from his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him, "Let her work instead of Uthman."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that presented the maintenance offer.
Uthman was discovered.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always surprised, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
We've become like this!
What do you say!
The issue is not with my words, it's with this poor employee, Uthman. What did he do wrong?
His mistake is that he is honest and loyal!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he just left.
What's the problem in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but we can't do anything about it.
It's not fair, Your Honor. He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He does this job to live! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister hired,
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to collect his belongings, I stopped him and said, "Go out, and I will send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have changed! Oh! Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will and destiny.
Praise be to Allah the Great.
The great and generous God, O Uthman, God will not abandon you, goodbye.
What's wrong with you? You don't look well!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Oh, the work! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity for me to visit my mother and bring you the things.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm just asking you.
How dare you go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed. Where have you been living?
I don't know, Mama!
You're crazy.
People have been liberated, the world has become a small village, where are you living!
What can I say!
Be modern, live the moment, and don't be late.
Take the stuff out of the car quickly! Come on, don't look at me and just close it.
Is something wrong? Saleh, what's the matter?
No, you're not okay today.
I shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
So I can forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The president is a bit angry.
It is an honor, Your Highness.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That is correct! Your Honor.
Tell me, what's the use of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
That's what matters.
That's why I want all of you.
There's no place for loyal people and those with rotten principles and values.
If you ever discover
He's just going to blame himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nour takes a bribe a day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't want it to be just like this, I want each of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to choose; you picked the right thief for the right place.
Enough, Umm Saud, enough. Don't torture me anymore.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient for me, He guides me and has made truth beautiful to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why bother with honesty and loyalty?
All your life, you've been a thief and comfortable.
It's good I didn't become a saint.
Let me talk to your father.
Never do it again.
He has to be on the straight path, but he bribes, steals, and is hypocritical to live comfortably.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Stop, stop.
Is this something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it discovered?
You don't feel shame, you're shameless.
I'm shy, brother, to wear it.
Are there any shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Would a respectable girl wear something like this?
And you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I haven't stopped supporting here.
I bought her some unnecessary see-through clothes.
I warn you, if I ever see you in a place below the knee.
Since you know the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
God willing, he will be a spoiled and naughty boy.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you,
He is a very kind man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, cousin, I'm bad.
You're a good man. To be honest, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
Only after we heard about it.
Praise be to God, I heard bad things about her.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Stop, dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I still love you, I disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, basically, paternal, dad is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't like to have fun.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
May God bless you, please go ahead, this is a golden opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians don't cut their nails.
In accordance with the State of Palestine's commitment in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
In any case, the United Nations is meeting today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinians' fingers.
To see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing sharp, nothing that could cut or draw blood was to be present.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
Olives, man!
We press olives this way, this way we press olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To set up inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh! Rashid, you must have a strong personality.
Now, brother, what number is the school where you work tomorrow?
I'm a teacher like you.
Why didn't I change my school since I started studying?
What character, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, it was his fellow teachers who complained about him.
To this extent, my brother.
That's why you see him as calm.
Then he started teaching.
What was ketchup, was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we're not talking to you to make you upset.
We're telling you because this is your last chance.
He told me that I accepted Rashid, even though he has a weak personality.
He is shy and very kind.
Whatever the case, he is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
A new wise man.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Alright, forget about it.
And from tomorrow,
Yes, this is good. What's the matter now?
Here I'm telling you,
I am a teacher. I don't like mistakes.
Let's say a boy shouted and told you the same thing the other boy said at your previous school, and the inspector was there.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, the door breaks.
Okay, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I'm telling you,
I'm nervous.
It's up to me!
Just shut up!
It seems he said, "Just shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said what concerns me, but he sees, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see him?
The problem is if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting, during the break?
You might find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, he's human.
But you shouted at me!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
My father is out of town and he will return next week, and when he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, may God preserve you.
Hana, we are friends. By the way, red berry ice cream is really good, you might not have tried it. It has a bit of sourness, but the taste is amazing.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is him telling his father.
I said his father is outside.
Yeah, he's out. His dad isn't coming back? They took his dad's stuff and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be serious consequences.
I carried his bags and brought them to him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me, I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
Yes, but what?
It's you who told me.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh! Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't bother, sleep.
Professor Abu Nasser, Professor Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go quickly.
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I gathered you, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can anyone guarantee a child?
This is going to get us into trouble, that is, he is calling.
At three o'clock.
I mean, hello. He cut the line, and he's joking, God.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stop for a minute, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Oh! Teacher, come, come here. Oh! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not laughing at you! Man, I'm just asking, are you done?
Are you done or not? Where is the teacher's authority? When you do this, you are degrading yourself and the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, the first thing you need to know is who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Come on, come on, we have plenty of space. Come on, come on, come on.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
God helps him.
I'm the boss here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
They used to give all the teachers extra classes.
Except me.
Who is the manager here?
You're the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair. Oh, my brother!
What do you mean?
No need, honestly I want to make things easier for you.
What do they call it?
What should we do to you now?
Act better for yourself and take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go, get out!
Okay, outside.
Do as you please, we told you, man.
We need to keep him in check.
Wait! People, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Saleem.
Oh! Abu Naif, you're the neighborhood leader and you need to stop him from crossing the line.
I'm not my father's son.
I'll see what I do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
I didn't recognize him when he came, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he got a promotion last week?
This means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What's this magic secret? Ask him, what's the secret that made him rise from the bottom!
Here I'm telling you from day one,
When I study, I don't want to hear any noise.
And there is nothing in the soul.
Behave politely.
And you still respond to me, and you still argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you're appointed as a minister, look for a good job for yourself.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the second job, no, brother, give me choices, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable one for me.
My brother is a minister!
I swear I'm not comfortable with the call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What are they saying, mother? May God guide you.
This is a very common thing. Every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, it's our pleasure.
They know I'm going to be a minister.
I mean, they're bribing me, that's bribery.
Wealth is coming to us, a treasure, a treasure that will be open to us.
The big earth.
Come on, everyone go congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Minister.
With your blessings, congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Highness, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister.
Oh brothers, the responsibility is great, may God help us bear it.
As they say, you're very qualified for this job.
You walked, then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
It was far from him.
Forget him.
I'm surprised how he started loving him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, well done!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband died, she said she had envied him.
God forbid, God forbid.
Yeah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, I'm tired of this topic up to here.
What do you mean by "none of your business"?
You just need to rest.
I cut them off because they made me anxious.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't like to say it in front of my mother, you know my mother tells it to everyone.
She says anything she hears, they call her the sieve, we don't want a scandal.
What guarantees do you have? If he falls from power, will he put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees do you have that they will throw it away?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Don't thank me, I saw him leaving the office just like I see you now in front of me.
You're going to bewitch him.
But the plan in my mind is guaranteed and effective.
This is a plan to burn it and throw it away.
I let him attend every event that took place in the country.
At this time, he will be burning. When he burns, he will be out of the office. When he is out of the office, he will be fired.
I swear to God! Brother, I don't know how or what to tell you!
Your visit is called, is called a participation that reflects how much you love your country.
Do you think so?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, Your Honor, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Come on, Your Highness, this is just a simple sheep, not worthy of your time. What do you say, Your Highness, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I'm tired, tired of the respect, tired of it.
You are the minister today, that's right. As he said, you are social, make a place for yourself!
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take a picture of me.
Take, take.
Today I took him to a poetry night and a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'm telling you about something very sweet that you should get for him.
Listen, I've also arranged a really nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Make it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it sparkles. I'm looking for that shine.
Seller, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, picture of Your Highness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Excellency greets you.
Picture, picture like this. You are my flesh, my flesh, O honor.
"Nothing, may God bless you."
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
It's a national participation.
Say "Mashallah."
This is the fourth friend calling me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurt me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
Children's swimming victory party.
One man was saying to his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, every day in the newspaper.
Correct, correct,
I came to the store and brightened it up, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's no problem.
This means you won't go and hang out with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to pick me up somewhere, I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
Please, ma'am, God bless your parents, ask him. I'll call you later just to double-check.
And you're calling yourself.
People give us discounts.
I told you.
This job is terrible.
Just let this man come and take me!
The minister's happiness upset me; may God harm him.
Hello, Your Excellency the Minister.
No, I'm just a bit tired today.
Okay, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We're at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and go with you, and God willing, he'll find a party or something for you.
Then, a party?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Okay, where can we find it?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there someone we can ask?
May God help you.
Sleep and rest.
Wait a moment, Saad.
Anything until the henna night?
Yeah, this is fine.
And there might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and find a photographer to take pictures of his face.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a match in the reserve league. Let him stay alone on the field!
What is this! This minister is a curse upon us!
Beautiful, this means he reached the summit.
His end is very near as he has become the talk of the town.
Your Honor, he has become much more famous than you.
If you go to a place and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh! Your Highness,
Shining star.
We'll shrink it and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break it. I'm not coming out.
They broke their cameras, I don't want any photos.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is Khalid, my brother.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why like this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see it!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Oh God.
Is this my immortality?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, dear.
What's he doing? He's totally obsessed with her.
"There is no power or might except with Allah, you keep returning to the same topic."
Get up, get up and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest, don't make a big deal out of it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my dad, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
This means he was playing, playing.
Yes, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Poor Khulud, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he's doing about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, my love, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to me and hear what I say.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
I'll let my beloved Amal choose for herself.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
So that in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can sail straight from our home to the sea.
We and our children.
Please, you need to decide the wedding date.
No problem, just a year and a few months.
What's with your brother, he puts on too much perfume.
Amal, frankly, noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
He's just so different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancé is late, he doesn't know there's a unisex perfume.
Tell your fiancé to keep his opinion to himself!
I don't care.
How true, Khalid!
It's not the perfume that you use like women.
So you can use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Frankly, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Currently, perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about this from our guys in the council; they say it's very prevalent in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does moves, do you know who she is? She's Khadija Mohammed's cousin.
For my cursed friend Khalid.
Alright, you'll see what I'll do to him.
His brother Saad is waiting now.
Why? Let him come and see, let Saad come! I'll send it to him via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you were defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Nothing, is your Bluetooth on?
No, I'll just send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I'm traveling tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself?
What do people say?
They say their son left them and traveled, you don't want to cause us a scandal!
Oh, really?
What your daughter Khadija did is honor and glory!
A man turned himself into a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people when they say he's gay.
Tell him he travels for treatment, study, work, or even if he decides to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandals chase me every day.
Where are you going?
What matters to me is where I go.
This is the end.
The second one we don't know where he is, and he's here packing his bags to travel.
Even we don't know where we're going?
What did you expect it to be?
What's wrong with you? I came to you for comfort, and you're throwing harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you were busy.
And Papa is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What Khadija did humiliated us in front of people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is the biggest flaw in my father's character.
We're in a strange problem, Kholoud.
I told him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
But only when I'm going to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to reach this level, damn it! {Aml.
Don't be surprised.
Khulud and her companions, they care about the reputation of their families.
And they heard their brothers and sisters.
Whatever the religious values are called
They seem to be dancing and cheering.
In the evil bank.
By God, boy, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Take care of yourself, boy.
Yes, Daddy, I have a little gift for you, Daddy.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
Present, Mother.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
It's possible he'll leave.
Where is he going to go? There's not enough time for him to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Daddy!
No problem, oh! Hope,
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your principles,
Just forgive me.
God helps you.
I see you're heading up to the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has one riyal, they can take a thousand, my dear.
Of course I can deal with him. God bless America, my dear.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
1,200
God help you, every time I talk to a driver, I ask him, "What's your salary?"
My salary is very low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, "My salary is too low and it's not beneficial." We agreed on a salary of 700 and increased it by 100 when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, once your year of work is up, we'll increase your salary.
It seems he's greedy and we're going to have a tough time with him.
Stop, stop, just be quiet, just be quiet, just be quiet, return it and get rid of it.
This word is easy for you, easy.
So it becomes annoying, I hate going out with him in the car.
Present, leave it to me.
Now you've told me the story, I'm the master of the house. Shut up, stop, you too, shut up, I'll handle this.
I want you outside, come on!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I told your friends not to come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Manager, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He'll be here for five minutes and then he'll leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in mind!
Don't tell the lady I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everything in the world has become expensive now.
And when did I give you seven hundred?
Manager, I have a lot of problems at home.
These drivers in Doha make 1,100, 1,200 riyals.
And it could be one thousand three hundred.
Wait, I'm thinking.
Listen, I'm going to raise the water and the power by 100%. Shut up, I won't raise you.
Don't say I didn't raise you right, go get a job!
What did he say?
I'm telling you.
No use in trying.
There's no use in two hundred.
I'm scared shitless.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers are fleeing.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you make more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at these, they're all drivers.
How much?
Two thousand five hundred.
I'm just afraid of the police who will take me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and I was about to leave.
I was calling, but no one answered me just now.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I just say, God is sufficient for him.
Present, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you file a report, you have no liability.
We'll do everything we can.
And you too, look around the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will bring money and when he's satisfied, he will surrender himself.
We accommodate them, spend on them, provide them with clothes, food, and driving lessons.
It's none of my business.
The match is starting now, go inside, it's better to go in now.
Yes, we were worried.
These foxes and foxes are not easily caught.
Do you know that if we score more than three, it means we haven't won? We need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear, this is clear sarcasm.
This is his level. If he scores more than three, it's not the Fox team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank God if they get less than three, they should thank God.
Any goal, these are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry, these are the Foxes, leave us alone, guys.
You scored a goal now, you're relieved and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals or the subject ends here?
This fox is very handsome, and incredibly clever. He goes here and there, and no one can catch him, it's dizzying. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said that this fox has a lot of problems.
You can't catch up with him.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the show Renew Yourself.
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I'll hit you. The Foxes team never loses, they're always the winners.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
Finished, the foxes are the winners.
Birds come to take their livelihood and fly away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and run away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox took the chicken and ate it.
I didn't see what your honor did on the field.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear in the arena and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with the Qatari elite who go to malls and places like that.
He treated me to a cappuccino.
What a strange world! Man.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't be ashamed that my team beat yours 4-0.
Speak boldly, speak boldly about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The reason behind this is the ruling.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ghabi.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month, we would gather to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board member of the club is the one who will decide.
They are not children, and each of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. Fox.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One of them speaks well, the other is mute.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get to him.
The crowds have left.
Wrap around him.
He's wrapping it here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Beautiful!
Shut up, you don't decide. I'm the master of the house and I decide.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subay tribe.
Buy it and register it under my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I help you? Guys, what do you want?
* * May God bless you,
Please, everyone, would you like some coffee?
You don't have anything to say, God bless you, you don't need anything, God reward you.
You're saying I'm sure, right? We're about to embarrass ourselves in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Mama, mama, I'm mama.
Now, I wonder what your father will do to us?
I didn't mean it like that, Mom!
Please, Mom, don't tell Dad.
Your father is turning the house upside down.
Of course, he's going to kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Come on, Mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What are we committed to, boy?
How did we find something like this? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Mom, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind?!
Are you blind, breaking the vase, are you blind?
Mom, didn't Waleed come to you?
No, the girl didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This isn't right. Be a bit more lenient with the boy!
This is not upbringing, may God guide you, girl!
What should I do now, mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I was worried about him because of the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to their neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he's kind, sweet and lovable Oh! A girl.
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from the devil and don't worry, God willing, everything will be fine.
Well, goodbye, my daughter.
Where is Walid?
Dad is going to hit me.
Grandma, Dad is killing me with his beating.
Don't be alarmed, my dear.
Don't be alarmed, my dear!
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son, come drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
God guide him, God guide him. Come with me, boy, a little.
O Allah, the Generous.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come on, boy, don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the poor man was distracted, trembling, and frightened by something he never intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase. Believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You have to support him!
Please don't tell him anything about me. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He's not here.
He's here! Where?
Enter, come on!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something new instead of the old one!
Come on, Nasser! My brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Dad, let's play this game and then study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Dad.
Come on, Dad, go ahead and ruin the game.
Come on, dad, come on, don't take it seriously. Come on, come on dad, let's study.
What? What are you saying! Listen to me,
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
What matters to me,
I'm telling him that you don't obey me.
Go. Each one takes his book and starts studying.
Okay, Dad, put your phone in your pocket. We're studying, Dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really confused. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he knows, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course he asks me, why take him to the hospital?
What's the problem, if I tell him?
If he knows Walid wets the bed, he'll kill him.
Oh! Mother, he's the one we should blame. It's all his fault.
Oh! She has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child, he is now twelve years old.
Okay, my daughter.
You're going to come have lunch with us and I'll give him some hints.
And I see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just an excuse, girl.
Fun and shopping.
She says he pees in his bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He said it's necessary to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
It's true.
They need to take him to the hospital! Boy, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
It revolves on a dry hose, nice.
Hit him until the last person in the neighborhood hears the screaming.
Sit!
Eat, my daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly, take a shower, I'll bring you some clothes. Come on!
I beg you, please.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you consider this a pass?
Khalid scored forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass?
Their grades are just fine.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Alright, uncle, uncle, this will be the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him one more.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. You're not allowed.
You're different, don't walk with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, man, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, man.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment. What you'll see at the end of the year, if any of you don't get fifty.
Go ahead and empty the pool.
Fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdulrahman
Wow! Khalid, excellent job.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent! Oh! Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
Hey boy, I'm talking to you!
Call, call your classmate.
He said he saw him near the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's place.
No, he didn't go there.
Where is he?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
What's wrong, brother?
Ah, of course he failed and he's afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail; he was an excellent student and ranked second in his class.
Nevertheless, he was afraid to go back home.
Because he lost two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh! Waleed, come here.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, you've missed one or two marks, it's okay. I won't say anything, I won't scold or hit you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
Which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
Saudi Arabia leads the scene with twenty-four percent of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, America and Nigeria.
Three percent each, and then the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent.
Therefore
And also production.
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons why major industrial nations are racing to occupy this region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, which is the largest oil consumer in the world.
Nevertheless, oil prices are on the rise.
At the same time as the fall of the US dollar
What is considered a pricing unit for oil?

This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time

Prices of commodities and the cost of living
In a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who want to participate, they can contact us on the program's communication numbers.
Honorable Member, peace be upon you and welcome.
I'd like to start with you about the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where might prices go?
Of course, where could prices possibly go? A puzzling question.
Or what we call market power.
Aren't you OPEC?
And what are the producing countries?
And what are the producing countries, and what is OPEC's relationship to oil pricing?
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't really have much to do with it.
What are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What drove investors away.
I felt a lot of pressure and turned to oil and gold, also known as commodity marketing.
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold as well.
Gold has risen from three hundred and fifty dollars in past years to nine hundred and seventy dollars now.
And until today, as I mentioned before, about one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all rising, and if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter, which is expected to see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
About Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation in the midst of political complexities
What was accompanied and now leads most of the activities of American newspapers and world journalism. It can affect oil prices.
Yes, 100% and today yes.
Today, we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Unrealistic factors may influence.
It causes a kind of disturbance in the market.
Thus, some types of political rumors were created.
He said there was no plan, but he didn't rule out the existence of other options that could be applied to Iran.
Markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, nothing is confirmed yet that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And perhaps there is what we have seen and what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
Let's see if these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
On the contrary, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil going into storage.
There has never been any shortage of oil supplies.
It could be a preparation for the next war.
In light of this reassuring picture you're describing regarding supply and the absence of any supply chain disruptions
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will rise to record-high levels.
Oil prices may rise.
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran and the other Gulf states
Today they account for more than 60% of oil reserves, and that's a fact.
You today
If a very minor accident happens.
Therefore, it refers to
This means that in the event of any war with Iran, it means there is no guarantee to what extent oil prices will rise.
God knows today you might arrive, we arrived without you.
Wars have reached one hundred and seventy dollars and might jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
And the speculators took advantage of these tensions.
Invest only in oil.
Or what is called fake investment, of course neither future buying nor future marketing.
They call it olive paper.
And it's all speculation in the oil paper.
His total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people might lead to more purchases rather than more updates.
I wish April was April Fools' Day.
I hope there isn't
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region, and this is on his main agenda.
Cheney is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese man's bag.
And I can't predict what will be in it, you know.
Is he igniting the war?
America is in transition.
Why doesn't the boy do something else?
Let's see what happens. If we're talking about April, it's coming up soon. In just a few weeks, it will be April.
And the world can pay.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
The cost of their production is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can.
Look, we've heard this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use of the
"To the last drop of it. And do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?"
Whatever these dreams are
When you sit with Westerners in a small circle.
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said: "It's strange that you speak among us in closed rooms."
Not the same way you talk in front of people.
Or the media said: This is for political reasons.
And of course, there's what they call double standards or two languages.
The language that you know in the Gulf countries.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And it enters into it.
Despite all this
Leader of the Central Region
Start a war on Iran
Even with an air war or airstrike as they say
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
I mean, I'm talking about non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (generosity)
Arab generosity
Please give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are the citizens of the Gulf, the OPEC organization, and the states.
You are very generous with Americans and insist on clinging to their currency.
I said the price of oil needs to be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the drop in the US dollar is from sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Those oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to drop.
A weak or stagnant U.S. economy, the U.S. can't "do anything" about it.
Therefore, what happened to this weakness and economic recession?
You also become like that.
The United States cuts interest rates on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is tied to the dollar.
The first one, more than 100 years.
The first one to start exporting the first barrel of oil exported from the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years, the world has been reacting and setting prices.
And which today considers Norway the third-largest oil-producing country.
Oil export
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing is in dollars, not in other currencies.
Everything is changing in the world, with second-hand sources and information pointing to something other than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and there's nothing wrong with it.
And these agreements
Oil remains the cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to cover these systems.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's talk about OPEC.
You have 66% of a deputy sheriff.
Among thirteen countries
Out of the eighty-five barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are many countries that are huge in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing in a second currency?
Look up the prices in another currency.
When will the adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, are very smart.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
Sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted this.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a direction and intention towards change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries can't change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of ~?
Let me talk now about why Europeans...
They export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or roubles
Because it is in their interest for their currency to be high and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here, where do they have a loss?
With one euro they produce one and a half barrels.
No, you're the one who loses because your currency has depreciated because it's linked to the dollar.
It's a big loss, a huge loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical relationship.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And you're attached now when you talk about separation.
It's like marriage when we get married.
And if you want to get divorced, it's not an easy matter.
No, here.
Or a Catholic marriage by the dollar.
And costs must be examined in a way
It was inspected professionally and examined thoroughly.
Similarly, Kuwait dismantled twenty-five percent of its currency peg to the dollar.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
The price of its currency may be adjusted.
Today about the topic, but this simply means you have no intention of studying the topic or thinking about it.
The exam, of course, differs as stated by His Excellency the Prime Minister.
He stated that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be in this study.
You're the only ones going in that direction with this issue.
Why don't you follow in Kuwait's footsteps after it has paved the way?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
We only
And there's nothing else.
that these four Gulf states declare
Everyone believes.
I mean those who support it personally.
He will support it.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
Was it made from one country or two?
Until the time of the currency
That means you're not going to fix the situation now.
Of course, there are experts who will conduct this study.
They are the ones who
We're not experts, this needs a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now. See what happens today.
People started..., I mean
Of course, in a state of collusion.
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached 14% and will reach 15% next year.
Eats people's salaries, swallows their salaries, the salaries of the people who work here.
Salaries of Qatar's residents eroded by 35 to 40 percent
We'll get back to you after the break to let you know the size of the salary increases that will be made.
The number of employees in Qatar will be at least for the coming period, so stay tuned.
Welcome back to "Limitless" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Energy.
And industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the significant increase in prices.
in oil that brought tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
About oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. But before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has eighty-seven and eight tenths billion in reserves and produces two and six tenths.
Tons only, and the report in the Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are among the highest revenues.
The expected revenues for Saudi Arabia in 2008 are $109 billion.
And it was
The last one hundred and seventy years in the UAE and sixty-six this year, and it was expected to be seventy-five.
Kuwait is sixty-four years old and was forty-five.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's a gas, as other reports have said, and by God, there's no envy, I mean we don't envy the deputy of excellence.
Iraq has seventy-four billion.
1.5 trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported one thousand billion, which means one trillion.
The dollar was a variety of imports.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5 but it will rise to 7. In Qatar, it was 13.75 but it will rise to 15 percent in Qatar.
This means that those living in Qatar can expect a high cost of living, from goods to prices.
Life is getting harder, prices are rising, and they are reaching high and higher rates in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be found.
And the solution means it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they say you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct.
In the Cabinet, against raising salaries.
He is in trouble and the solution must be the ideal solution.
And what is a patch solution?
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And that's it.
The important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
That His Highness issued to form
And He humbles (them)
And lays a strong foundation.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If I control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now.
The study specialized in market research and was published last February, just a few days ago.
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you will solve the inflation problem and let inflation eat away at these people's income.
Many of them now
Entering other countries
We'll increase our salaries, then solve the inflation problem, and then reduce them again.
I repeat what they say, which is to balance the subject.
Just now
And it is not a temporary solution.
More abundantly
That's why it's here.
To stop inflation
Boredom always
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, right?
The second point is
And those working in the private sector are not the same as those working in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
We must consider the matter of the increase fairly as well.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Highness, not in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
More than that
Among the Qataris who worked in government offices, some have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Facing a problem
To move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And he gives good salaries.
Linked to what is known as market power.
Or market power.
They don't come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because the salaries are low or the expenses are low.
Or with the expenses they bring with them
"Tamam, with our clear understanding."
I'm not predicting events and I'm not saying there's going to be a raise in salaries.
There's no hope left.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
On controlling inflation.
And God willing, this is what the report said, that Qatar in the year two thousand and eight
God willing, we say that.
We'll see if these numbers will change.
Sprinkle some of it on the people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and all that.
Inflation
Because spending
A lot on different projects.
Let me take a few questions from the audience, and I hope everyone asks a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
They are based on the ruling families of the Gulf.
That's why I don't think the justification for this is the difference in OPEC.
Secondly, the total income from oil goes directly to the governor.
Then for the royal family and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as is.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Hello, my brother Ahmed.
I won't prolong the discussion. The brother mentioned something about rulers, regimes, and the issue of the Qatari riyal, its pegging to the dollar, or other Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world and force it to swear complete loyalty to her.
The U.S. deficit reached $82 billion in Sino-American trade.
The European Union with her at sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states.
It will end up as a confrontation between America.
Among the advanced countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the issue may become...
Pure soldier
The explosions have Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and American bombs as well.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad, is...
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I saw, his happiness insisted on not responding.
The topic of decoupling from the dollar because the dollar is declining.
With God's permission, you will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
What should follow the style of Arab brothers?
Thank you, Brother Mohamed. Thank you. Now we have the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you too.
Thank you and thank you for the wonderful interview.
What's required is a salary increase, God willing things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Salaries, God willing, are things.
Okay, tell me your question quickly.
Your line is going to be cut off, do you have a question?
All this is because of the high prices, the increase has reached all goods, they are all imported.
I am from European countries.
In the Arab world, we have factories and laboratories.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you. You took your time.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
In the matter of supporting the poor, the man told you to embrace the poor, Your Highness.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers, we are.
I know Qatar.
This is not true for the State of Qatar.
Today, anyone who comes to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
What will you do with this wealth? Where will you spend it?
What within the framework of the response
When the Moroccan spoke, he spoke in a way that was neither genuine nor realistic.
The person who doesn't see with his eye is...
If he comes and sees Qatar and all the major developments taking place there.
As a large model, you are right, you are asking.
And every person has the right.
And since your numbers are few, where do you bring people from?
Does this really mean you'll bring the surplus from China, for example?
No, we won't issue, God willing.
The country is built on a plan and
The ideal independence of the amount of money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
that Qatar will become
Considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well
Focus on
And what will have a great impact.
In the post-oil and gas era
So you're not copying Dubai?
Every country has its own unique characteristics.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
About the ingredients
There will be a medical city where people come for treatment.
There will be a media city that adapts.
Of course, today's world, today we need to build.
Build a vision.
About the post-oil and gas era
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this change because it took us by surprise.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And even better
Today in vision
And the vision
And the vision
Thank you, Your Honor, and I also thank our audience.
Thank you for following us, and we hope that we have provided you with valuable content.
Qatar's foreign policy appears cryptic to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special ties.
At the same time, Qatar had relations with Israel and still does.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar offered.
Started
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar's bow was not far from the important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Israeli prisoners.
Gilad Shalit, the hand of Qatari foreign policy reached out to him in a way that disturbed the largest Arab states.
What kind of power does she have to be in this position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Hello Your Highness
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the Hijaz newspaper or magazine.
The agreement that was concluded with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in which diplomatic relations were restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was very long and needed a lot of answers without your final question.
What I believe you gave him
Especially regarding the Saudi topic.
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar.
Between the two countries
You spoke about the silence of the island.
You spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I think these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
Always limited in scope
From perspectives
And thank God, this was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years ago
They were intelligent, honest, and had relationships built on trust.
I want to limit myself to the misunderstanding between the two parties.
This matter was addressed and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It's not a seasonal relationship, but a strategic one.
We hope that it doesn't just continue but evolves.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia, so this is not diplomacy but faith.
The topic of the island falls under media.
Between the parties, many countries have intervened.
Thinking that it can gain points and score at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
For reconciliation within the Gulf house.
I mean compared to what came before.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, just an understanding of love and mutual interest.
But besides that, you can ask the island's management.
Did you establish strategic relations between you and Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
Can we say one, two, three, and four?
And there must be unity.
Some disputes were settled on this basis.
Between some Arab countries and attempts to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint about a certain policy in a certain action in a certain situation, and another state has a different opinion.
Two points of view are considered.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Criticizes him
Were you tired and decided to head in a different direction, and from there moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Exactly the same idea.
No, no, we don't enjoy either of those things, we have nothing to do.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
They and I know that there is a very big misunderstanding.
And you know that we founded
And there will be a kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
Began exchanging clashes with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, 18th edition, last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, he stated that the expanded inquiries
In the Hezbollah network, a sabotage plot was uncovered.
Three countries are involved in targeting Egypt: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And his struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And who is eager?
On Arab relations
The first point
Gaza Issue
As they say and as we acknowledge.
Qatar is
A smaller country.
This could be part of such plans.
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that again.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy
What I'm trying to say is that the lord of the house can protect it, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, and I'm not going to defend them.
If the situation stabilizes in Egypt.
Why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids don't come from nothing.
He said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And she tried to organize a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable with him.
I can only say that we're certain.
That's for us.
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
Our brothers in Egypt were forced, and that's why we blame the Egyptian officials.
The conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming for this.
Days of the sweet scent of peace and the cause of peace are upon us.
It had previously been held in Egypt.
And then with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with him.
You don't have a problem with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive.
This allergy
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this allergy
Or three
Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt doesn't want revenge against Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar and that he is at a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we hold it before any organized conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And with procrastination
The conflict began.
Not even a small country can.
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this too is considered a crime against Egypt, not against anyone else.
When they said later.
Okay, are you on the island?
The Israelis had indicated a day earlier that there was to be a cessation of hostilities prior to any speech, by anyone or anything.
What is it?
My brother allowed medicine and food to be brought during the beating that our brothers had to endure.
Once they said the gate was narrow.
I can't let the trucks in.
They tell us there's an agreement on the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
What matters to me is neither Fatah nor Hamas; what matters to me are the one and a half million people who are being beaten.
And those who don't have medicine.
When we started talking about this topic and discussing the Gaza conference
Qatar's involvement in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
What is intervention?
We didn't say how Egypt will resolve the situation because that's within its purview.
An official said, "We have uncovered a major plot regarding this matter."
That's what he told us after revealing the plot.
We, meaning this officially.
He tells us that Egypt is a big subject.
Okay, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask a big country for many things.
Because Egypt is ours.
And you were invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
We didn't receive an invitation to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified position.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know that Turkey entered the things through Israel.
I would be happy to see him enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the interest of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question and introduction, it took me a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me.
No, I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, anger.
Who is responsible for you in the Egyptian system?
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom that he sought.
And he wanted to make reconciliation.
That's why he allowed some countries to attend and others not.
And I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreements with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among high-ranking officials
A large country discovers that a small country is doing such things.
That means you had one.
Takes on any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five great nations decided.
Any country other than Qatar is perfect.
But these sensitivities will only make the situation worse. Why do you have to voice your opinion on everything around you?
We want to address this allergy, take an antihistamine, they need to tell us what the allergy is.
Why allergies?
It's some brothers from the government.
They want, they have an internal dysfunction.
They want to draw attention to a conspiracy in Gaza, a revolution.
As the English say, blame the Italians.
Everything that happens
Not just for instructions but also for analyses
We know what happened because
The issue needs to be resolved locally.
And it was not solved.
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first look at the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
And to search for the causes that concern my Arab nation.
"Or Qatar tried to reconcile."
And thinking about any Arab issue can contribute to it to the maximum extent possible.
Why are you being provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
What sprang from his heart.
Let me finish.
When he announced an initiative for reconciliation and gathered all the presidents in Kuwait, we hoped for something good, and I welcome this.
There are dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, I think, or a TV interview or something like that, I'm not going to respond to it.
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests.
And it is also a response to the invitation mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But the only advice I can give him, and others, is
They are trying to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics; no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and weaken its ties with Turkey and the European Union.
The first thing is that we are few in number.
If we can pull this off.
This is not correct.
There are some accusations against you personally.
To pay money to Shalit's captives so that Qatar takes Shalit and bypasses the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money. First of all, we didn't pay any money, nor did we talk to anyone about paying money.
Just this situation.
We support Egypt to solve the same problem as we support Egypt and still do to solve the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who kept the Palestinian president until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and for Palestinian institutions to remain until the conflict is resolved.
And we said that
"In the Arab League, but he said no, we let it happen because we believe there are people who don't want this."
We just did it cleverly.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
I really don't know if there's a problem.
I don't know whether it's from us or from them.
They decided now in the twelfth issue of last April exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter the so-called Al Jazeera media channel and the end.
It's just a matter of time, and everything will be over.
Are you afraid that the island will become a thing of the past?
Do you mean we're currently living in a stage of political adolescence?
I also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We didn't concede to them, nor did they concede to us.
We treated them as brothers.
Balancing a small state against the large state of Egypt
In Saudi Arabia, there's an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk.
Okay, how is the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him heavily.
Let me be honest with you.
Is it not a dispute in the main policy?
I hope it's not a personal dispute because we have no personal disputes. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If you asked me, I'd say there are two problems: Gaza and what else?
This situation has affected all of us greatly.
We want to solve this problem from a psychological perspective, meaning we want to resolve this dilemma.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
It's clear that things have gotten worse and haven't been resolved.
No, no, I didn't hear it.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They blame us, and they have the right to as our brothers.
And we blame them, this is their right as our younger brothers.
With the big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big country.
I mean, Egypt is large in terms of satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution will come from heaven.
If anyone is waiting for satisfaction, it's us.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with non-nobles or brothers.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if someone deceives someone else
I know the Israelis are doing this to us.
The previous American policy under the previous administration was either with me or against me.
I don't think they want to imitate either Israel or America in this matter.
Even if we take their policies, they are still pressured by third parties.
In many cases, let me finish my speech.
We understand and know that in some instructions even for large countries
Who controls your policies?
We have no movement, the only thing that moves us is one thing.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal matter.
And we will help the Arab world as much as we can.
Sources of power: the island and Al Udeid base.
You could say this isn't strength?
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want, Qatar is great or not.
We just have a different opinion.
The first thing we did was separate the Israeli office and lock it.
First, they were saying to close the office, so we closed it. They got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team called the Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans, Europeans, and my friends—we know how to deal with them.
Plots
What was done.
This is a flaw, we reached a certain point and then what?
Tell me now.
In bullet points, how do you plan to resolve the issue with Egypt?
Based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it is important to consider it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious about this matter.
Just some staff
I need to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, government, or any other leadership or nonsense.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how it's going to be.
And I know there's time for reason.
And there will come a time when we are gone.
If it were up to me.
Or them
Large Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will find this topic.
Do you mean life is still going on?
It means we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you have.
If someone helps us, we'll give him an arm.
Now His Highness Sheikh
We never ran.
Unless it's well-founded, we're not ready to run for Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There are many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they were affected by this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or in high-ranking positions.
You know it's not our habit to cancel work and cancel in this matter.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market with changing demands, one is canceled and another is brought.
This is a matter of supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
Present, quick answer.
The office was there.
We've disturbed the office, so it's best we leave now.
We were putting pressure on him during their election campaign. All our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we closed it and left them to fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them, as is our custom, we invited all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state.
So it was an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when the relations, as they say, were good. We honored her, but now the situation is a bit difficult.
There's no reason for you to open the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no longer any reasons to keep it closed.
I made it big.
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me be clear with you, our relationship with America is a strategic one.
In some things, and that is it.
What's the most important thing?
There are things in our region in solving some issues where we had disagreements with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
Serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny that.
What's happening in Iran and what might be its impact on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among themselves
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they will overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
Important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervene whenever any party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and all that's left is the strategic conversation between the president.
And Lebanese groups
About how to see.
Regarding Yemen, there is no role for you, or they just took a stance.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And in the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Emir sent me twice to meet the President of Yemen.
And I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And they did not respect the agreement, and I do not want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Did Qatar take this position and then get accused of paying money to the Houthis and high-ranking Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And whoever stands with unity does not stand against it.
And another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
We don't have a problem, but to be honest, I was surprised.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time is up, but briefly tell me these problems that happened to you because of your efforts to solve problems, will they change your policies in interfering with other Arabs' problems?
If he could hear me, I wouldn't think it necessary.
And he was in a great display once.
Over five billion dollars at that time; if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars, better than a headache.
I just say it with faith because maybe it's time in the Arab world now.
What is allowed in these circumstances?
Thank you very much, Your Highness.
It could even be exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
Why did what happened occur at the convention in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To empower the committee and provide it with all necessary support.
To discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
When we went to New York, we were able to make a more balanced decision.
We pursued this in Doha because both parties were concerned.
We tried our best not to listen, otherwise there wouldn't be any point.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The real problem is clear to us after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was determination.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the region's atmosphere directly affects it.
Whether it is peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to have this position.
Under these conditions
Unfortunately
External repercussions
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is a problem, won't be the number one problem.
The sheikh's condition, I know the timing might not be right now, perhaps it's a bit early to talk about the scenes, but
What happened when I came here?
Participation on the ground has somewhat stopped now.
I didn't even delay for a single second.
I know exactly what happened; even the Lebanese leaders told me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
I will present the idea; His Highness agreed and supported it.
Where are all the Lebanese leaders present?
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each specific area.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
And they met each other on the same plane and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the start, it was our idea.
And this was the most important decision they both made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League
Then we need to be honest intermediaries.
Praise be to God, I believe this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has done its best.
On both sides
To reach a dignified solution for both parties.
And there will be a solution, and no one will lose.
Before you take any step
Consultations were held at the Arab League and we received support.
What we did
And I said to him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll bring them to Doha.
And he advised me.
They lock them up and take their phones.
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why did they want the solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
There are many things happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire.
It will be in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign intervention.
And we try our best.
Sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point we need to discuss.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
I need a self-review in the Arab world.
Due to Arabic variations.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
In the war of seventy-three
Why can't Arabs agree on a solution to a problem?
I think it's interesting.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties are required.
Invade wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because here in the Arab world, we face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
We have no power nor strength.
And how can we stop the game in the square of Arab countries?
As Arabs, at least the minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
And we see.
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust among us, trust is missing between Arab countries.
And the Arab states
It's not so much betrayal as it is a kind of...
What is the word for jealousy?
This is a situation that requires support from everyone, I mean, I think.
Okay, will you fulfill this wish and actually request an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
Is it possible to take a role to mend the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
Eager to find solutions, and I'm sure of their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relations have improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab call to wake up.
I just can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted on the ground as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation, and there might be other cases later.
Will you remain afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can only provide food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness is always there.
There are more than one and a half million Palestinians under siege.
And we do not want them to have neither weapons nor support.
They are doing all this.
And there is no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we just provide them with food and medicine.
And our dispute with them may continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides put the national interest before everything else.
Leave illusions behind you.
The Palestinian division is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit
This is a serious matter, they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they must even ask to go back to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
Resolve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I hope there's a simple solution.
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
We won't be part of it and we won't accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests don't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf must be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iranian cooperation and peaceful neighborhood
But when they call you, they say Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
Never
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if there's no objection.
Frankly, Your Highness, we are facing a big obstacle, but we have reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
Information can be disparate and unrelated, but this is what happened.
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul? Do I know if it has specific dates?
That means you knew there were negotiations.
Continuously seeking a solution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led to
For a positive outcome, we gathered some parties from various sources.
And we started talking.
In this research, there is an Arab and Qatari methodology.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the subject step by step.
At the last moment, he overcame an obstacle that persisted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And get rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
What do you consider your role to be now?
Listen, the most important thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
I have no territorial ambitions.
Or even have control over a second state or something because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our fellow colleagues.
But in the Arab world, this is very important.
In order for us to have countries, they must be
I want them to do something, and it's important.
Delegating some small countries to take on this role and supporting them.
In some things, excellent; in others, good; and in some, less than good.
Last question, Your Highness
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or repairing enmity
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
We fix the problems in Arab countries.
To choose an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
At the national and regional levels
But if we become stubborn
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the war on Gaza.
We start by requesting you to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Arab States at the ministerial level.
As if you'd changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, my brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Facing our brothers in Gaza
Conditions require us to do a lot.
Qatar ignored the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not only through the Security Council resolution but also
What is trodden on and undervalued.
Let me say it in another sentence.
And we are polite.
The street can no longer bear it, if we bear it as responsible for the Arab street.
What he can bear.
When we were in Egypt
There was written consent from ten to eleven.
Some spoke at the meeting, and we could have held a meeting.
We will cling to it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if, in a meeting, they might have a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not advertising, our goal is to find.
Does that mean you ignored the summit?
Even we ask ourselves
We're going to press the other poor side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's focus only on the topic of the Arab Summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly, the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We found that most of our brothers support the holding of the summit.
With those who are present.
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia or Latin America.
Unsolved
Those classified as moderate countries
What does moderation mean in our eyes?
Is he going to abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No country allows the interference of neither the good nor the evil.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it was intended to drag us into an internal Arab quarrel.
Okay, if we go to the Security Council.
There is no Security Council resolution.
I hope that after Israel finishes its mission,
Well, the second Arab ministerial meeting you were invited to attend.
What was dominated by intense discussions, disagreements, and arguments.
There's an important point.
This is not the thing that matters.
Why do we call a meeting?
About terminals.
No peace anymore.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because one side tells you we have to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Frozen peace talks with Israel.
We say we're at a party. She says we're going to lose in this.
There is a greater loss than the one we have incurred now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and adhered to the decisions since the truce.
You say that fights aren't important.
There were people who wished for Hamas' destruction and things like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a disagreement between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not all people
I don't want to speak for others.
It is important to be men to ourselves and men to our state.
We work on the policies of our countries.
Who does these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone, I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the dispute here is whether Israel will implement the decision immediately.
We can say there's a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and request Chapter 7? I'm sure there are difficulties.
What is doubted by the international community and if that happens
He's going to be a little shy.
The situation
See if they did something for the Jews and Israelis.
They take their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs didn't go to the Security Council
He agreed to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try to influence us.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world and there are many people, you can see how the Arab street reacts to this.
But this decision is important.
On the subject of addressing our bosses one by one
In the end, they said there was nothing and that it was a lie.
Okay, so we're like Germany now and we're not demanding anything?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who initiated the attack, but say you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
Work hard on how
For his contribution
In a manner as if it were destiny and an act of God.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Arabs considered or some considered Resolution 1860
Our colleagues worked hard to make the decision.
What was issued by the Security Council
I don't want to say it was a victory or not.
What will lead to
Let's assume that victory
What are we going to do?
We're supposed to be aligning with the rest of the decision.
I just want to assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will comply with the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israelis refused, Israel came and agreed.
It means "so we" or "that means we" in English.
Do you have an alternative, or is it better for you to call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
In the meantime, I'm ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group overcome another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start trying to make plans.
Once they held a meeting, I don't know if it was a European-Arab intelligence gathering or something like that, without mentioning names.
And when they did that, it means we participate.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The follow-ups because the Gaza problem started two years ago, not now.
I'll talk about the subject from two years ago, but specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
What was released but not implemented.
Don't ignore our invitation.
They might think our viewpoint is different.
It was required that everyone have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same opinion, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, the parties involved were few.
Preferring one group over another that participated in the siege of Gaza
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with all that's happening now in Gaza.
We are partially aware.
It's a problem, let me tell you that we're not fully informed.
But I know.
Palestinian conflict
He was fed at the Arab and international levels.
Even if it wasn't burning, they wouldn't differ much.
And after the elections...
Hamas won and took power.
By majority
We had to give them a chance and see.
They want reform, or they are still rebels who only know weapons and fighting.
Just today they came inside.
On the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some say that an attack is happening now.
Hamas, which broke the ceasefire, or the Palestinians from Gaza who broke the ceasefire.
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain suffering from hunger for two years.
No problem.
For reasons of Israeli security
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that's not my concern in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
And then who is supposed to decide?
Either this or that, not every sovereign state chooses.
Our government
It is the main problem.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we had worked hard, we would have worked hard to fuel the conflict.
But it is clear that we have been asked to allow one group to dominate over the other because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider it.
All that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party to provide them with a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, as you said, I was
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian Initiative, the Unit.
And Egypt in Cairo
Those Egyptian efforts
No, absolutely not, this is not manipulation.
This is required for an important role.
Egypt's borders are also next to Israel and Palestine.
We
And we don't want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we bring people together to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
It has to be.
That's why we always ask them for a big role.
What was announced?
Does this mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give the possibility of success or study.
I believe in his chances of success.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Make Palestinian perspectives more similar.
And it is the party harmed in Gaza that should discuss the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was issued.
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we have.
We don't want to hear any sides.
I really wanted this, when the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the league, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
Let's show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
What we allow power to do
To be our goal, not to build our policy.
Remains in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't reviewed its materials.
Do you think, in principle, that this could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860, as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day that passes
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
That's why we don't want to postpone, nor do the Israelis want to postpone on this matter. Once they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I'm sure the brothers in Egypt know this and are aware of it.
My father explained everything I said.
It's now necessary to solve the problem.
And it's not in the way Israel wants it to be.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
Arab vacuum
Undoubtedly, it is a distinguished position.
And he has Arab depth.
It is an accessible entrance for disabled Arabs.
We know there's an Arabic disability.
Part of it was due to disagreements.
Partly because of the point of view, everyone thinks their own view is perfectly correct.
And a second person believes that his point of view is better.
And what is in the conscience, how can you make people respect and recognize that there is an Arab decision?
And they don't come one by one.
Another one says no, there's no problem, we just give them an extra two or three days to contact them and bring the guys to be equal and solve the problem.
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we are dealing with them.
At the Arab level
Just wait.
At least we tell them no.
In the context of the required stance from Qatar, stances such as, "We'll come back to this point later."
At the same time, in the field, I heard
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
Firstly, what Brother Khalid Meshaal said is unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit down with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important word.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing Israel's conditions also imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions, why isn't it allowed for them to impose conditions when Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arab gift?
They are just people and we don't have to listen to them. Once they told me De Gaulle didn't listen.
Completely different, first of all, de Gaulle liberated his country.
With allies or without, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
Now what are we talking about?
Is this the Arab gift we're supposed to give?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we've seen.
What can be verified from these rows that you request. (Note: The original Arabic sentence structure is a bit unclear, so the translation might not be 100% accurate.)
Similarly, many of those criticizing Qatar in this situation are also demanding
About what's happening, the actor and the office are still open.
They speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
Cut off all ties, even if someone claims they have a treaty.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but in this decision and even harder decisions to come.
From this decision
We need a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells to another for spiritual or material gain, or claims to.
Yes, before we close this file on this matter, there are still countries that have taken individual steps.
Chavez is a different case, he has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to reclaim.
Five ambassadors with their permanent membership and presented arguments that these are films.
We've finished the job, and the street now knows more.
With a high ceiling, Your Highness.
Or demand that Lebanon's forces confront the Israeli aggression, and so on.
Do you think it could work if it's placed within a single Arabic framework?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"And that we encourage"
How are Syria, Lebanon, and the other countries going to unite when there are Arab countries that don't even speak to each other?
It has to be.
Change in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already over.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Give an example if you regain your territories.
The situation in Gaza is going to change, they are still
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals for Israel mean the objectives of the operation for Israel.
A day to strike someone, a day to punish someone, and a day to please someone.
An example is what happened in Lebanon; for them, it's not a good example.
A sample solution that happened in Lebanon.
I consider him good.
To Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other, should we return our land today or tomorrow?
Their differences over power
In the distribution of power
This differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than a Lebanese intellectual.
That's why the solution is much easier.
And here's the problem.
His Highness Sheikh
We only have a few minutes if we finish the matter until it's possible.
And diplomat
How can this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Let me tell you.
Or reject
And help
This is what worked for us.
It will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The problem isn't in the initiative as much as we feel.
We help those who solve the problem, without mentioning the name of Qatar because some people have issues with mentioning Qatar.
"And not to bring a summit because there's a summit in March."
If we take an initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And do not press them.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
We are going through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and wish that our Arab brothers will assist us as much as they can in this matter.
And we hope to keep him out of the competition.
Arab Competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one point.
And these are our problems, okay, we struggle with each other and disagree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait, in the coming nineteenth month, I believe, of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as you have mentioned, and as Your Highness has explained.
Does the entire Arab atmosphere support it? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
Of course, we attend any summit held in a sister country.
And we have no objection to attending any summit.
But what if it becomes a political summit?
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they've been struck for twenty-five days?
Bacon
They say Arabs can't unite, right?
We said that.
We said that.
With all due respect, this summit was scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own way.
Therefore
And he entered in peace.
And say, "This is it, a promise fulfilled."
For this meeting
Thank you to the audience for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law specific to
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has also delivered over seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
First, let's agree on the term currently in use.
When talking about people with disabilities, do we say "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities" as you mentioned?
The first good evening.
Taken from a human rights perspective or culture of human rights because persons with disabilities
Because he treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
And then he became disabled due to his attempt to adapt to society.
The medical concept was the prevailing one at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Pedagogy and special education appeared.
This class has become...
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
What are the basic rules upon which it was built?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And accelerated the pace until the emergence of the international agreement, which was legally binding and characterized by rules in this regard.
I set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
Those who deal with these people treat them as humans and as people.
With the change in conditions as mentioned, is there a change in the outlook of this group in society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
That the Arab world was distinguished or differed.
Nevertheless, legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but perhaps the reasons are lack of financial resources, isn't it?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say: culture does exist, but sometimes there's a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, awareness is a bit low, and human rights culture doesn't exist.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries and are of working age.
And suffer from unemployment.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or with mines and weapons
Men are one degree better.
Add disabilities, they will be in remote and distant areas.
That's why there are many regulatory bodies working in this field and trying to raise awareness.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of establishing many religious centers, in general.
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things that, praise be to God, we achieve through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
To set an agenda
Or incorporate the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't say that and agree with you that there is a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to disability cases.
Within the social, political, and economic context, we can expect the circumstances of people with disabilities to be...
While they are from marginalized groups
In a country like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I can't say for certain that there's no improvement in the situation.
And it has already been implemented on Earth, and if I can give an example, I would say
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities experiencing health issues are covered under this strategy and there are other programs as well.
what we tried to ensure afterwards
On the ground with organizations
Kamal Kirro is with us now from Syria, welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Solomon, I'm sorry, please go ahead.
My best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
Cognitive blockage means that the healthy individual was the result of what became a pressure factor leading to cognitive blockage.
I caused my son a disability as a result of torture and imprisonment, and he suffered from mental retardation. He is still under treatment, and it has been six years now.
I know there are around four hundred children and disabled people in prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know as they know their children.
And the whole meaning without them pretending to be something they're not.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, from whom wisdom is not taken.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest for a comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental impairment.
Yes, it is among the global rankings.
Regarding disabilities, of course, intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities such as visual or hearing impairments and motor disabilities.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is
The verb and the reaction that occurs in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Certainly, dealing with a disability takes a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to address and work on...
In other words, it's everyone's right.
Until they provide for them
Various qualifying aspects to ensure their ability to enter schools as well as the labor market.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, there are in this international committee
I, too, meaning as a special rapporteur
I was honest about my job, and that was positive for me, even if it wasn't directly related.
Who supported this position?
I've seen her at many meetings, like the international conference.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Constrained by these limitations or shortcomings
For example, regarding legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
Unfortunately, the United Nations delayed it slightly during preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll end with this.
From the governments of the world and non-governmental organizations members in the United States
We completed the second survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To find out how far programs for people with disabilities are on their agendas
If he sets budgets, is there involvement of people with disabilities?
Human rights
And it's not limited to development issues only.
We're taking more calls, we're now joined by Meshri Naji from Algeria, hello Naji.
You have to come back.
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly should bear the blame.
I wanted to ask, I am originally physically disabled.
Okay, we'll direct this question to Naji Mechri from Algeria, thank you very much Ahmed.
Hello, I'm Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guests.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even hosting them in seasonal tourism, and this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
All we're talking about is unproductive debate. Thank you.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support people with disabilities and allocating one percent of the net profits of every organization in the world.
This must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will address the plight of many disabled people and war victims, and so on.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and mentioned his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning through Algeria.
The needs within the community must be met within that community.
Are these the same rights that should be granted to anyone else?
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
That's why I'm really calling from here, from this platform, governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
Ensures
Those needs and rights are within current agendas.
No, there's no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of a person with a disability or who needs it, if the state
They are capable and must be committed to actually performing.
I advise him first to return and approach the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it falls within my national scope and should remain within this scope.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there are many countries that have signed it but are not committed to it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why aren't there any laws?
It is certain that we are in a human society, which means there are many errors and many truths.
Certainly, many agreements and undoubtedly many treaties do not involve literal commitment.
Or an ideal commitment from several countries that have joined several conventions such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know that.
But the question of adopting and regulating a convention
First, we'll ensure there's at least some awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of the pyramid with decision-makers.
Officials, and then gradually develop until they reach the entire society.
As well as our commitment to prepare reports and submit them to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of awareness.
In the reports I worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations, they were...
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
It has a relative advantage in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important for people with disabilities to be...
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, will say to us.
Mr. Naji Saghrena will speak about the subject. Welcome to Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
With me, Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf
Chaired by H.E. Sheikhessa Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar
And the committee's chairperson, Sheikhaha Hessa, had a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is in fact
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish I were a deaf person.
That these countries implement this international agreement.
This will serve people with special needs, it is essential that
Actually, you have someone who can execute this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
We'll continue our discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your opinions on important economic, political, sports, and a variety of other issues.
Text message service through Al Jazeera Live
Dear viewers, we welcome you once again and our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disabling an international support fund
Disability and the obligation of all countries to provide funding, what is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Mission to monitor the implementation of regulatory rules
For six years of work, there was no significant support.
Only from China and Austria
And always, I thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
Who established the office, and through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
I mean like what we brought up at the beginning, and this point is always brought up.
Circumstances of ordinary people
So how is the care of people with disabilities or the care of the disabled called?
This means that there is a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
People with disabilities, children, and refugee and displaced women
All of this can be achieved to a degree they call...
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality.
And there are these voices that always demand and never get tired or weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
As he has presented, and I really thank him from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Does the funding to assist people with disabilities cover only developing countries and Arab states, or not?
Even developed countries don't provide.
I mean, the person before me, who is Swedish, yes.
And also some EU countries
Of course, in many countries, especially in the Arab region, they might not...
So far, they only know about the existence of this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
In the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately only one state.
We'll only talk about the Arab region.
We have more calls with Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, hello.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Hello Dr. Sheikhah Hessa
Almost ten.
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role for a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean sometimes even when we persist.
What's your role with Qatari girls' children?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, and Kawan Behjat from Kuwait. Hello!
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in the ground?
Those with special needs, we can count them.
We can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
By boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
This if we are truly believers.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her and to the State of Qatar for all that it has provided for people with special needs.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
And for your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is a second level of disability, regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level could be a result of inbreeding within families.
I think it's a large percentage.
This leads to disability.
Many thanks to our flag-bearer Chérif from Tunisia. Now I'll hand back to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a mental disability go?
And where should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
In the past
Oh no, I mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The standard-bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
and scientific papers, etc.
From organizations' programs that work solely on disability, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All of these have attracted many campaigns and programs to reproductive health.
Spoke about this aspect
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
To demonstrate the risks of consanguineous marriage
and genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but of course it takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but there must be some legal commitment.
Yes, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman inquired and suggested allocating one percent of the budgets of Arab states.
To help those with disabilities, let me first...
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization for the whole world.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Their group consists of women.
But these numbers are doubling.
Like studying in South Africa where they observed and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three are disabled.
And since the Arab region has become an undeniable conflict zone
Even the suggestion presented by Kronan Behgat
One percent is not enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups
Frankly and sincerely, I don't think it suits you.
This requires addressing their problems and needs.
Make sure that disabled people are the most neglected.
What governments usually do doesn't take disabilities into account.
True, and this is linked to the culture and sometimes the constraints of society.
When the census is taken by
Stakeholders
There is a disabled person in the house.
There was only one question asked, was there a disabled person or not?
The relevant department and the concerned individuals therein
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend obtaining more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we haven't reached an accurate result.
Care and attention must also be continuous. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Hello, Fatima.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I thank His Highness, the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, for adopting this category.
I'm really proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Messaferi, hello.
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Messaferi from Qatar is with us now, Nasim.
Abdulkareem is from Jordan, hello Naseem.
Come on, Kareem, we can hear you.
And peace be upon you too.
God bless you, to be honest, I have an intervention.
First of all, I am an audio specialist and I worked in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month-long awareness campaign for speech and hearing issues.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns about hearing loss.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, he offers new and good services.
Frankly, he provides new services, whether they are material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They get good support.
Okay, you're kind. Do you have a direct question? The issue is just due to time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, the services are excellent, and I think they are absolutely wonderful.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person works in this field.
Regarding the subject
I'll review the agreement later.
What is necessary once it gets the approvals and joins him.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of rights for these people, regardless of
And frankly, what?
What we do during this period for people with disabilities and why.
And you wish now that it would happen.
Of course, I wish either.
I hope that this will be a measure in this research or survey and provide higher quality research in this field.
It also became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
Coordination among Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, it's not just about rights, they also receive rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
Now with us from the league and Al Kass channel, Lana on the line, good morning Lana.
I'm also happy to welcome the active captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone is welcome to speak, frankly. Lana, please.
I had a five-hour studio session and a two-hour session the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, for they deserve this international achievement.
I might have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area, and you have extensive knowledge in this field and these lines.
Because even our file
And competitively, we deserve the difference of six votes between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
This is because our file is rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, very well supported, for example, the fields.
Maybe some people were afraid, maybe there was a little bit of chaos, like in America.
And in some countries, it might already be available; they don't need to provide fields or prepare special projects for this event.
Because they're already ready.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as players, I think this is a very significant achievement for athletes.
It will impact the economic, political, and health sectors, I suppose.
Okay, you guys are players.
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, this is a great achievement especially for us, I even saw how people who don't exercise were very happy.
Inshallah, Ali, tell me about the moment of the victory announcement.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio station.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
And you're driving the car and listening to the radio.
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course we had the sunroof open.
He popped his head out of the sunroof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned on the flashlights and started our own celebration.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day, and I think all the channels focused on this event to a great extent.
Lana, of course you were involved in this activity.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what were their reactions?
There were many media outlets and channels from all around the world.
He became a main teacher, very clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Of course, Ali. The presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that must be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this specific point?
Okay Ali, did they mention the required characteristics to be in the league?
More sports events coming up now.
We need to prepare a strong generation.
This has strong foundations and well-planned soccer tactics.
What are the laws and principles that a player must excel in?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Rigorous and continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help him dedicate all his efforts to games or training.
I believe every stage has a unique advantage.
It has a unique taste and feel.
Talk shows and sports programs, which one do you prefer? Where do you find yourself?
It's amazing.
It helps you maintain your physical fitness and teaches you how to keep healthy through exercise, which is the important part.
Even if everyone watches football matches, you'll automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Are people working in the media limited to only one side?
What's holding you back on one side?
This is an open field, not just for football.
It's all sport, but sport is very nice.
Ali, there are also some other important topics I'd like to discuss.
Would you wish to go back ten years in age to reach the year 2022?
Ah, I didn't wish that you
Of course, now everyone dreams of this, especially since it's the World Cup. Now any player
Anyone who watches a World Cup match will be happy, imagine if they were playing in the World Cup.
I hope they meet the expectations. This is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love being with you.
As I said, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar TV has become like a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our patrol is brave, and God willing, it will win several different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are things there? How are you? I hope you're doing well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Of course, yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
I think some of the young men who were watching us think that you are...
Required
It's very common in the Qatar League for players to move to other clubs.
I think I had a great opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
And my situation with the team is very good.
How can we make sports a social topic?
And beyond Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Everything connects, everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all areas of sport.
Every individual, young or old, in this society is aware of the importance of sports, and this awareness is growing.
About eleven or twelve years, even to reach this event, is enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a generation aware of sports from a young age.
We understand Aspire, Aspire is an efficient building.
Essential for the new athletic generation
We need to be firm and move forward.
Especially football.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the different team matches?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association still hasn't found a way to attract the audience.
What methods should we use to attract them to attend these football matches?
It depends on the person themselves, some people don't like attending the stadium.
By the way, the media plays a crucial role in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a famous club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs %pw, and some club managements organize some activities and events.
For attendance, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
They love what they do and believe in their abilities. As I said, they don't just need financial support, moral support is even more important.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
So I'd love to hear your final thoughts on Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
God willing, Captain Ali, your final words that you would like to say in this interview?
Congratulations and I wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and player Ali, I wish you success in your sporting progress and in your life. God bless you.
I love sports even more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say that these songs are popular nowadays, but they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people are singing Arabic or English words.
Today we're going to talk about this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We'll get to know them better through the direct interview that brings us together.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
I'm from the West, specifically America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about rap singing,
He is bold in using any word without any hesitation.
Anyone can rap.
To write song lyrics,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Therefore, we will know all these many and important details from two people who have immersed themselves in this field.
Make a nice team.
Yusuf Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yusuf.
Hello everyone, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discovered that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
On behalf of the citizen.
Including joy, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I think they are like an artist painting a picture and a poet writing a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of speech?
Two thousand ten.
Do you feel that people like to buy rap music CDs?
Diverse ages
There are families and many people sitting and listening more than before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are still in this band?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and rap.
As the singer, the rapper, says
He's the one who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Ah, okay!
I ask him to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs you produced from Salman, from Yusuf, from anyone in the same band.
Did you consider releasing it on CD and making it available in stores?
Only when you know if someone was alone, meaning I'll make the album and release it in the market, that's a tough commercial recording and procedures.
Okay, why didn't you think about that? You're 25 years old, and as they say, one hand claps alone.
There must be two of them, God willing, you have twenty-five hands, may God protect you, all of you as young men and brothers.
You can create a CD and sell this CD through multiple websites online.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think there are thirteen songs.
Registration is not like it is now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
Its quality is poor, not like now, but it's clear.
Burned about fifty CDs.
There is rap, I can't say it wasn't because there might have been young people who knew this art ten years ago.
Not as strong as the record and I think the distribution at this time, the situation is different now.
Especially since there's diversity in music, and there are many types of techno music now.
These young people and these artists produce a collection of wonderful songs.
And also, we'd like to talk about the parties you attended.
See, the party we attended in Doha was one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club, and they were very cooperative.
We sneaked a peek at the audience.
We were surprised; we didn't expect such a large number.
And we were still surprised that more families were coming.
More than the youth
The organization was excellent.
We were a bit nervous because this was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect the attendance to be this high.
The audience interaction was amazing.
And it took a long time, so there were many songs.
Alright, let's hear something, or lyrics I've written, that the audience, especially the youth, would enjoy.
Let's hear some words so we can present them to the audience.
Can we hear it directly?
Take your time.
Go ahead, Salim.
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
It's nice to attend the program in the morning.
Salman is experienced; this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't love it
They have no idea about it.
The words are random.
Okay, for the songs you've sung, give me some of your previous lyrics.
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle".
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words we choose carefully.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Doha program.
We're live on television, for the audience.
Let's see what each of them will present.
With some of Doha's morning.
The beautiful song you just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate this. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He won't find it easy to implement the topic.
So everyone writes.
Sure, I suppose every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He still loves sports.
Or love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, Qatar's youth are represented.
He's waiting for Doha to shine to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate this event
We are streaming this video live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's go back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, who are delighted to be with us.
They are an Arab Gulf rap group, right?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, frankly, we
We're planning a party, but it's not definite.
Okay, you're working on a party that, God willing, Youssef will announce.
Insha'Allah, but it's not confirmed yet, we're still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Also, Salman, where are all of you gathering, twenty-five people?
Where do you meet, and how do you gather all the ideas together?
Sure, there are some collaborative songs.
It's not necessary for anyone to love Salman or Youssef or any of you to sing a whole song.
There must be cooperation among all of you.
Frankly, it's difficult to gather all twenty-five in one place.
I start calling Youssef and the other guys and ask them to meet in one place.
To look at the song and the lyrics
And there's a second way.
I record my share.
He continues.
So he records and sends it back to me.
And see other experiences
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Sure, we always
Artists have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone and the same words,
We don't produce anything new, we want to do something that is
We benefit from them a little.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
In a primitive way, let's look at the report together so we can benefit and enjoy it, let's see it together.
The talents some people have are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dalil
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the expert, one can
Discover, locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our parents and grandparents
I was seeking help from experts to locate the wells.
He pierces.
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
What are modern techniques?
Soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
They are underground tables.
Either pomegranate seeds.
Fig branches or grape branches
Now, the process of discovering water tables is applied scientifically.
To conclude, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back.
From here, we start marking.
And here, the table ends.
Requires a lot of experience and patience.
So we can determine the sensitivity of the movement.
I've been to many places.
Ninety-five percent of success.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What really amazes is the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to Allah, who taught man the unknown. This report is from Saudi Arabia.
Those who have their own band and more than one CD.
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song with a stronger theme.
Addressing an issue, etc., there are many matters.
I see him as a role model.
Inshallah
And at the same time, we want to
Played a wide range of songs
As much as you can
From time to time, let's keep in touch with you.
To keep up with the band's latest news
Just let's focus on the band's name.
They are rappers.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful weather.
We are live with you through this direct link.
Wherever you are on the Corniche, you welcome the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth
He only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome back.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to contact the company, but no one responded.
As a band, you need to develop yourself, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You'll find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together on this wonderful production.
You create and match images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or just download it from YouTube and websites that contain videos that one can watch.
Some people have done this before.
There are many songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company to adopt you, and no website.
You really need a place where you can all meet as a band.
What are your aspirations, what do you hope to achieve and attain?
Whoever protects us.
Organize an album for us.
I wish it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
Just a coffee lover.
Ayh shared some things with us, some series.
We hope it improves.
And we will have someone to support us and stay with us.
Yes, Salman, we also want to know your wishes.
My only wish is to produce a music video.
We wish you success.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And he carried a message, as I just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Greet the group, and we wish you success.
We'll end with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is KD's program and DJ MREldoha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KJ, Madam Bobo with SKT, it's really hot on the body.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Doha program.
We're live on television, for the audience.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Let's see what each one will offer.
With some of Doha's morning.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The manager Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are the Qatari rappers, of course.
It can be repeated and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a handcart
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in...
A large screen will display the components of this product.
This was a great and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, the scanner in the cart detects the item.
And made shopping easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I guess it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
Or our ambition, for example in a number of projects, around four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues
He deals with traffic jams and other issues like the parking problem. He is very creative and wonderful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Professor Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if I should mention some of the projects that were presented or not.
For example, for underground transport, the genius idea is
As soon as the man leaves his house, he finds the elevator.
They gathered at one point.
I assume all the viewers are enjoying the images they're seeing now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, it's like an ATM.
For women, for example, I have a card.
Go in, and I say I need a t-shirt.
For example, some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
This is lost, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Her Highness
At an early age, this has great significance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
We also invited speakers and orators.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we need to open the doors to children who are genuinely interested.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve this core idea.
The diverse and varied skills of children
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
It's all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing such talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Innovation Center for Girls and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very important role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in clarifying Qatar's vision.
And training children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, as each program is built on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of projects and institutions
What changes?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and great support.
And faster.
We are currently, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we're keeping him busy, especially since we're in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth
What's your final word of advice for the parents and children watching now who are interested in joining the center?
Who are we giving this to now?
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We must take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It is important to provide care and attention to children.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
Encourage him, for we encourage the parents.
To give greater attention to a child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
We toured the exhibition and while watching their projects
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
Dreams come true, many are accomplished and become reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there success.
Our hearts are with you.
God wants.
Of different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
This is considered to be very pioneering and deserves to be implemented.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Professor Abdullah, tell us briefly about the exhibition.
Many events have taken place, for sure, so what can you say about them?
The children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
I will grow up until I am thirty years old.
We started training children to envision Qatar 2030 across all three of its pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Later, so you can start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I guess they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will grow bigger and bigger.
Sir, I launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of the Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt this when we were strolling with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for twenty to thirty days.
A child thinking about the future in twenty years.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are passionate about.
There need to be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
They were also the first-place winners in the Arab League.
Sure, all the children.
On the sides, there were various performances on a specific schedule.
To display the projects they made
There is a large attendance, a very unique attendance.
Stars of science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
What is an innovative or creative forest or reserve?
And also we will talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also part of children's dreams and vision for Qatar's future.
It's an idea for twenty or thirty.
How can a child share a creative idea with twenty to thirty people?
The main idea is that there's a slice inside the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movements.
Or the field changes through this electronic chip.
The one who is playing soccer.
It has creative ideas, of course, the main idea, and some people might ask.
and projects
We always say, "We've reached this stage."
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
They give them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
It gives them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain their idea.
In a field he loves, connected to something he enjoys, all of this is an achievement.
Offer support, we thank him for it.
Which is currently in the development stage
Similarly, the public, the committee, and some responsible individuals supported the projects.
First, no, it was the second, because that girl.
Pipes, channels for underground attendance, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
A huge protected forest.
Where can visitors walk around and see animals and reptiles?
There's also a sensor attached to some animals to monitor their condition.
There's also the marine environment, and the way to enter is still innovative.
One of the reasons that made her win is her vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
Someone else spoke about an underwater tourist city.
City of Butterflies
A forest on Earth.
And many ideas of tourism.
Very exciting
This might be what their minds need, at this time, maybe in twenty, thirty years.
In the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
It was adopted by the science club, they said these are the projects we need to work on.
There's a project, the excess water from the air conditioners.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The article says, "Qatar University celebrates graduation."
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and Calgary University
There are also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
One of the rising young actors in the Qatari drama scene.
For how long, also classifications and colored threads.
Actor Abdelhamid Charshani is considered one of the self-made actors.
If it wasn't convincing,
He won't choose to be in jobs that are done within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is participating in the series "Killer Feeling" and "Classifications Part Two."
We are happy that he is our guest this morning.
So we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his overall experience.
Hello to us and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning Show. This is my first time meeting you, and it's your first time on the Doha Morning Show.
With the people who work hard for the program.
And you, Madame Lisa.
Welcome! Before we start our discussion,
Okay, let's see.
I am a responsible and executive man.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if anyone agrees that you don't have to return the bisht,
Of course I have another question to start with, but since we've seen this part of the series, it categorizes the first part.
He pointed to Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais with the city of Marrat.
A lot of things and information related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we'll watch this excellent report from our colleague Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's see it together.
Certainly, it is the testimony of people who know about courtesy, not favoritism.
And as proof of the history of this city or the second.
As much as we see of her effects and what we hear from her storytellers and poets.
Classic and modern, so this is considered an important addition to the city's record.
The city of Marrat is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There has been a debate among historians about how it was named.
Some believed he was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the wadi named after him.
The date of its foundation is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Jebel Komeet, which has inspired many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical sites.
This scene is considered one of the tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Marrat has made a great effort to achieve this.
A garden on this mountain
And places to sit for the locals and all the people in the kingdom.
It was named after the companion of the Prophet, Khalid bin Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
And among its effects is the Wadi Kimit.
This is a place where water from streams gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important water sources in the past.
One of her works is also the House of Doom for Heritage.
Marat is a city with a history dating back to the pre-Islamic era.
He was famous for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Jebel Akhdar.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed to the program Sabah Al-Doha,
The city of Marat, north of Riyadh.
We are back again with our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about these methods and techniques.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very unique.
We open a page for him and he is registered through having a special record in our system.
Parent's email.
This report contains the extent of the increase in attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guardian receives a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
To register his son online.
And he saw his son's progress.
He can see his grades and focus on the teachers.
So we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this sweet girl.
So we can gather most of the children at the center and send them our best regards.
I registered at this center with a teacher there.
To assess her intelligence and the level she has reached since she joined the center.
Of course, this year.
He focuses on one task after Ramadan.
But this effect, of course, is always at the expense of other works.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV while people transform their months of worship into TV.
Lessons, lessons, a series of lessons, lessons, let them do one job every two years, is that better?
Of course.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
I just wanted to send you all my best wishes.
And God willing.
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was organized in Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And develop the abilities and skills of children more.
Different from the diverse schools in this generous country.
We have a model, and we spoke with our guest who was with us before.
We have with us Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam. We welcome him and wish him a good morning.
How are you, Omnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Amina is an example of this.
We'll also try the technique or method that Ms. Nesma mentioned with her.
Do you feel a difference in his thinking?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
Things won't change regarding his mental skills, nor will his educational level change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the student's level or the change in their level through it.
Now there's going to be a test or something like that.
Omnia will calculate and respond immediately on air.
Of course, Omnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We'd like to ask about your participation in the second part this year.
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the series of classifications of the first part,
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky with several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with CEO Ashraf Shohata with Mr.
It's Tara's opportunity to produce art.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have more than one episode where I'll be playing different characters.
On the contrary, this is a wonderful experience. In this work, we can
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have representatives from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al-Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adam.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Osaim.
This happened a year ago, and last year we used to do two jobs a year.
This could be the reason that made me ask you before going on air. You've been acting since 1997,
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition in acting.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I chose acting as my talent. The actor Abdulaziz Jassem supported me in my early days.
He is one of the actors who consider me like their son.
If you need anything, call him.
We were in all of his shows.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, and a very, very special thank you to Professor Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, around twelve to sixteen new actors come every year. Why?
They have it.
Of course, many thanks to him for providing many opportunities.
Okay, let's say,
Let's talk about the second series, we had an idea about the categories.
We need to know about the killer feeling.
And the man, too.
We have a sample, and with us is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Mayouf Al-Tamimi.
For this procedure to happen live on air.
"And we can see how we can treat the person. Let me first say good morning to Professor Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome."
Sorry, and peace be upon you.
Let's start with you, sir, please.
Inshallah
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
Let's see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty that shows all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
You feel dizzy sometimes.
Headache and dizziness.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yes.
By doing this, Professor Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
From his left side. His ears, he has a mild inflammation in his middle ear.
It hurts! What does this mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
From the day I was born and from the day I was a baby.
Do you still have pain here?
It's the sinuses!
Do you have a pain in your nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
Your thyroid gland isn't working properly, you feel tired and sluggish all the time, and your body feels heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel sluggish.
You always have tonsillitis.
In it. See the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He's stressed, and you walking barefoot, it might be the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is massage still beneficial for children?
The mother's thumb, praise be to God, is the size of a child's palm.
Most children aren't sleeping, why?
When you pick him up, he doesn't like it, but people think he does. He has gas in his belly, God bless you.
When the mother puts her thumb, she stretches her thumb.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it so that every mother can learn this move.
She starts pressing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
It's about the child, about, about, about the child and he's sweet.
Well, regarding discoveries, you have special discoveries for women.
As we said, in every house with ninety percent women, God protect them.
First thing, the first warning is about ceramic and conductive flooring.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's not a problem to walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when they use ceramics in homes, health problems have increased.
Because it's cold and even.
Since there was the carpet, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
Increased.
A woman should focus on walking barefoot on the ankle.
This is the foot and the area behind the ankle, the ankle.
From here, this is the foot and now under the ankle.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Focus with me a bit.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, once you're in the delivery month.
This means, what comes in eighth, eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman must be careful when walking barefoot.
If she had been on time,
"And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will let fall fresh dates upon you."
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
Even I discussed with scholars and they told me: Why change the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God put in this science, and He inspires me."
A palm tree trunk is swaying towards you, when the tree sways, what does it look like?
It's sharp like nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, it gives an order to the wombs, which is the area of the wombs, here in the middle.
They are the entrails. They give orders to facilitate childbirth and reposition the fetus.
Elevating the fetal head or repositioning it, so it comes out naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
And he takes the hand and starts to soothe it.
Some take it as a practice, and some know it's a science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you, and you won't believe them.
Yes. Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
I just want to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If anyone wants to get in touch with you, anyone at all, there's a specific email or you.
Okay, the mobile number is in the control room. If anyone wants to get in touch with Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, through Qatar TV numbers, so he can reach us and get this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like the rest of the people and I do everything you can imagine. I'm an ordinary person.
Nevertheless, we aspire to more good.
We always think of good.
Viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the man.
Show us a live demonstration, how you detect the diseases this person has.
What he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from him, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read about him online.
The way it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or in the coming years, or if it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So we were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
Frankly, this show is about the first lady in New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for this.
They presented it to us, we adopted it and said it was perfect.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
And he stops playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
Kill two birds with one stone (proverb)
In the sixth week, he tells us what he gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are concluding today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
Raquia is an independent girl.
And with high spirits.
The family became more aware, and their siblings were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food like them.
A transitional culture emerged between the student, who then transferred this culture to their home and family.
He goes and tells them, "They are the ones who gave me this or taught me this."
The training staff or the person who provided this information to the students,
How did you choose him, and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many aspects that helped us, may God reward them for their kindness.
Our brothers at the diet center teach them about food, of course, healthy food.
And learn from Ms. Ayesha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn cooking, sports, or raising awareness about the value of healthy eating.
It was in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the boys and girls.
These matters are not something that concern a specific person; we are all responsible, responsible because these are our children.
How these students behave at first!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Are three shifts or specific shifts sufficient in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts within a reasonable range that includes all the features; sons, daughters, independent, and private.
Since it's not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as how they accept things for their children and what they don't accept.
They basically want to be involved in it, and frankly, it's very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want others to be thin, but he imagines it's impossible.
Some actors we see in the movies with slim bodies, he says this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the mornings of Doha, we can remind them of it.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
The person needs to know the benefits of fruits and needs to know that if they eat them, their health will improve, so they will have high morale.
As for fruits, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruits.
This is the point.
It is diverse and of course competitive, each school was creative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We give them guidelines, and each one must be creative.
Do the teachers train the students, or do you have a special staff for that?
I built them, I built them.
But teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would leave Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and adopt it, Rania's school said they will have a parade.
They said they were going to have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to do the healthy cooking themselves, the girls were better at it.
Also, I would like to thank Rayyan Water for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Rayyan Water for this matter.
Of course, water is much healthier because it helps cleanse his body of all the toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, they might not like team games.
Welcome with us live.
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and manager of the Multiple Sclerosis Association in Qatar, is welcomed here with us.
Of course, we try as much as we can to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce and raise awareness among our dear viewers about multiple sclerosis.
Because this name might still sound strange to us.
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All available treatments now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start to
He kills us by striking the nerve cell.
Let me simplify it for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, it usually causes dizziness and blurred vision, double vision.
That also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst cases, it leads to madness, quadriplegia, or paralysis.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions in the body will be significantly affected.
Or from this disease a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories suggest that it was transmitted by a virus.
The disease is non-epidemic.
What is passed on to children?
Some people consider it a regional disease.
The equator, for example, was exempt from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have not been able to find the cause of the disease, which would enable them to find a treatment for it.
Currently, the process is reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In another sense, they seem to be working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this issue, which we can say is that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a particular group, a community that feels this disease is spreading especially among them?
Internationally, it has been ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the international association for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started to include young people up to the age of forty.
Nevertheless, humans can't recover from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the association, Multiple Sclerosis Qatar Association.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so they thought about forming an association for this matter.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, they say there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My number was sixty or forty-six.
Are there symptoms that indicate the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We're not certain it's a virus, so we don't want to commit to a particular theory. That's one point.
The second point is how can I know if I have the subject or not.
This is very difficult.
I am confused! Professor Abdulaziz, I am trying to discover a specific point.
