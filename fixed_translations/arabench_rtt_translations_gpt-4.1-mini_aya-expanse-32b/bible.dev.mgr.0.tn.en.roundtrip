environmental Jesus' family lineage
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah. Their mother was Tamar. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
Ram was the father of Aminadab. Aminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon. Solomon's mother was the wife of Uriah.
Solomon's father was Rehoboam. Rehoboam's father was Abijam. Abijam's father was Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram. Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Koniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon.
After this, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Matan. Matan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
There were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were 14 generations from David until the exile to Babylon. There were 14 generations from the exile to Babylon until Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her to shame before the people. So, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
"For he will be born to us, a son, who will be called Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins."
All this happened so that what the Lord said would come to pass. He said it through the prophet.
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14). Immanuel means "God with us."
Sufyan awoke. He did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him: he took Mary into his house as his wife.
But he did not establish a love relationship with her until after she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. We have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, as was all Jerusalem.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "That's what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said to them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me word. Then I too will go and pay him homage."
After the wise men had heard the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them. At last, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their joy knew no bounds.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and warned him not to return to Herod. So he took Mary and the child and they fled to Egypt. The family of Jesus escaped to Egypt.
When the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose and went to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. Therefore, he became very angry. He issued orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of deep weeping and lamentation. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returned to Nazareth.
After Herod died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
Now after they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him." So Joseph took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus it was spoken of him by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person the prophet Isaiah spoke of. He said, "A voice is calling out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothing was made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people went out from Jerusalem and all Judea. They also came from the whole region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruits that show you have repented for your sins.
Don't think you can say to yourselves, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.
The axe is resting at the roots of the trees. All the trees that don't bear good fruit are cut down. To throw them into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, and call you to turn away from your sins. But after me will come one who is stronger than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
He used the pitchfork in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor. He was going to gather his wheat into the barn. But he was going to burn the straw with a fire that could not be extinguished.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this, to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus weeps.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you. To lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you kneel and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah had said came true. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where people who are not Jews live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The lands east of the Jordan River!
"The people who have lived in darkness will see a great light. They have lived in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent of your sins!" he said. "The Kingdom of Heaven is near." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. I will make you fishers of men.
At once they left their nets and followed him.
Going on, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Then Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked in all the regions of Galilee. He taught in their synagogues, preached the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were shaking violently. Others were completely unable to move. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up a mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Congratulations to those who are sad. So they may find solace.
Congratulations to those who have no pride. So they can be given the land.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Congratulations to those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Congratulations to you when people mock and harm you because of me. Also, congratulations to you when they tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Paradise is great. In the same way, people hurt the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Moreover, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. Instead, they put it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
I didn't come to abolish what is written in the scriptures or the prophets. I didn't come to do that. On the contrary, I came to fulfill the true meaning of what is written.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, obey and teach these commandments. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
How then shall we say to the Romans? You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, "You shall not murder (Exodus 20:13). Whoever murders will be subject to judgment."
As for Hany, I'll tell him. Don't be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be brought to trial. Moreover, whoever says to his brother 'Raka' must face the Sanhedrin. But whoever says 'You fool!' is in danger of hellfire.
Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come back and present your gift.
Assume that no one has a right over you and someone is going to sue you. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still with him on the road. If you don't, he might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officer. And you might get imprisoned.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Don't leave until you've spent your last penny! Adultery
You have heard what was said, "Do not cheat." (Exodus 20:14)
As for Hani, I tell you, don't even look at a woman in the wrong way. Whoever does that has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose one part than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is just one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell. Divorce.
They said, "Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he does so, he must give her a divorce certificate." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
This is what we tell you: A man who divorces his wife makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. Oath.
Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago. They were told, "Do not break the covenants you made with the Lord. Keep the oath you swore to him."
But Hany, let me tell you. Don't make promises like that at all. Don't make them in the name of God. That's God's throne.
Don't do it in the name of the Earth. That's the chair beneath my Lord's feet. Don't do it in the name of Jerusalem. That's the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head. You cannot make even a single hair white or black.
Let your "yes" be "yes." Let your "no" be "no." Anything more than this comes from the evil one. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"But Hani tells you, do not fight with an evil person." "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well."
Suppose someone hands you over to the court to take your shirt. Let him take your jacket too.
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with him.
Give to anyone who asks you. Do not refuse those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You've heard it said, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But Hani, let me tell you. Love your enemy. Pray for those who have harmed you.
"Then you will be children of your Father in heaven. 'He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
If your greeting is like that of a hypocrite, what distinguishes you from others? Even people with no religion act that way.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to people in need
Be careful not to do good deeds in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not boast about it and let the trumpet announce it. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They announce what they do in the synagogues and on the streets. They love to be praised by people. What I am telling you is true. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then I gave it to you to keep it secret. Your father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners. They want people to see them. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, don't keep talking a lot like people without religion. They think they'll be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you even ask him.
"This is why you must pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who have sinned against us.
We did not fall into sin when we were tempted. Deliver us from evil.
Forgive people for their mistakes against you. When you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. —Fasting
To walk around without eating, don't put on a gloomy face like those who pretend to be holy. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They have received their reward in full.
But to walk without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Others don't know that you are fasting. Only God, who cannot be seen, knows. He will reward you. God sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal."
Your heart is where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. When your eyes are clear, your whole body is filled with light.
But if your eyes are not bright, then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and not like the other. You cannot serve both God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Are there not more important things in life than food? Are there not more important things for the body than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky. They don’t sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you more valuable than they?
Can worrying add even an hour to your life?
And why worry about clothes? Look how wild flowers grow. They don't work, they don't spin, they don't weave clothes.
But Hani, let me tell you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these flowers.
If God dresses the wild grass, won't He dress you even better? This grass is here today, but tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!
Don't worry. Don't say, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
People who have no self-control run after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge people. Then no one will judge you.
Judge not, that you be not judged. With what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.
You see a splinter in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get some dirt out of your eye," when there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
O hypocrite! First, remove the splinter from your own eye. Then you can see clearly and remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks will find. The door is open to those who knock.
Suppose your son asked for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
"Or do you think He would ask for a fish? Who among you would give him a snake?"
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the kingdom of my Father through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and hell. Many are those who enter by it.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few are those who find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can truly know people by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thornbushes? Do they pick figs from thistles?"
As the saying goes, every beautiful tree bears beautiful fruit. But a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Not every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You shall know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?'"
Then I will tell them clearly, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!" The wise builder and the foolish builder.
So everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain is falling. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man. He builds his house on sand.
The rain is falling. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and hitting that house. And it's making a loud noise.
Jesus went on to say all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught like one who had authority. He did not speak like their teachers of the law.
Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this. Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The centurion went away in faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded with him to help.
"Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed and in great agony."
Jesus said, "Let us go and heal him."
The commander replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I say to that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servants, 'Do this,' and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
We tell you that many people will come from the east and the west. To take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. To sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
As for those who think they belong to the kingdom to show off outside, in the dark. They will cry and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! As you have believed, so it will be done to you." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was lying in bed. She had a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
He did it so that what the prophet Isaiah said would come true. He said, "He took on himself the pain that we should have felt. He bore the diseases that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus has a price.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him. So he gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then came the religious teacher. He said to him, "Master, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another follower said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a severe storm came upon the lake. The waves struck the boat. Jesus was asleep.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Sir! Save us! We're going to drown!"
He answered, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it became completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus Heals Two Men Controlled by Demons
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two demon-possessed men met him. They came out from the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before we have been judged?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was grazing.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and they drowned in the water.
Those who were tending the pigs fled and reported this in the city. They told the people what had happened to the men who were possessed by demons.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own city.
Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man got up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with wonder. They praised God for giving that kind of authority to men. Jesus Chooses Matthew
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this. So they asked the disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard that. So he said, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but only those who are sick."
"Go and learn what it means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will pull away from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead daughter and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came. He knelt before Jesus and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with them. So it was that his disciples also went.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus from the crowd. She had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
She thought, "Let's not touch his belongings. That way, we'll be innocent."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl didn't die. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After they had put the people out, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that district. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
As soon as Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
They will be able to see each other again. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about him throughout the whole region.
As they were going out, they brought a mute man possessed by a demon to Jesus. When the demon was driven out, the man began to speak.
To cast out the devil, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has happened in Israel."
The Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." But they were only a few servants.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were like sheep without a shepherd, scattered and helpless.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest field.
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
The names of the twelve apostles are: first, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew; then, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
After them come Philip and Bartholomew, Thaddeus and Matthew the tax collector, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The other two are the jealous Simon and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Instead, be shepherds to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have been scattered.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying, give without being paid.
Do not wear gold, silver, or bronze in your belts.
Don't take a bag with you on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, summer shoes, or hiking poles. The worker must be given what he needs.
Whenever you enter a city or a village, look for a hospitable person who will welcome you. Stay in that person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet the people living there.
If this house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it doesn't welcome you, don't bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I'm about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I send you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men are going to hand you over to the local courts. They are going to whip you in their temples.
So that they may bring you before the rulers and kings because of me. So that you may be witnesses against them and those who are not Jews.
But if they arrest you, don't worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time, they will give you the right words to say.
You will be the one to speak. Go to your father to speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will turn against their parents and leave them to be killed.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
To be attacked in one place, flee to another. What I tell you is true. You will not finish visiting the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The disciple is not better than his teacher. The slave is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can the others who live there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything secret will be revealed. Everything hidden will be uncovered.
What is whispered in the dark, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Don't they sell a pair of sparrows for a penny? But not even one of them falls to the ground without your father knowing.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You're worth more than many birds.
What do you think of someone who says in front of people who know me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know Him.
But who am I going to say in front of people who don't know me? I will tell my Father in heaven that I don't know Him.
I don't think I came to bring peace to the Earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.
The boys will turn against their father. The girls will refuse to obey their mothers. Kenana will be against her mother-in-law.
"The enemies of a man are his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
If someone finds their life, they will lose it. And if someone loses their life for me, they will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will attain the reward of the prophet. And assume that someone welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person. That person will attain the reward of the righteous person.
Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my followers. I tell you the truth, they will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus continued to teach the twelve disciples. Then He went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus replied, "Go back to John and tell him what you hear and see.
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Congratulations to those who don't give up their faith.
"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go to see? A man wearing expensive clothes? No. People who wear expensive clothes are in the palaces of kings.
What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says, " 'I will send my angel ahead of you, who will prepare your way.' (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
Let those who have ears hear.
What can we compare today's people to? Like children sitting in the markets, calling out to people. They say,
We played the flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song. But you didn't mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank like you. And people say, 'He has a demon.'
But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?" And he told them a parable: "There was once a man who planted a vineyard, leased it to tenants, and went abroad for a long time. When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. He said,
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
"But this message will be easier for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than it is for you."
And you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the realm of the dead. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"As for your transportation, on the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom than for you." Rest for all those who are weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad. That's what you used to love.
Dad gave me everything. Dad is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know Dad are the Son and the people the Son chooses to reveal Him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy for me, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath day, Jesus walked through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck and eat some heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
He entered the house of the Lord. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath the priests in the temple must perform their service on that day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
We're telling you what's more important than the structure is here.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what these words mean. If you did, you wouldn't accuse the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
After he left that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and crooked hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
The man's value is more than the sheep! The law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It became whole like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to say who he was.
This was to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken. He said,
How blessed I am. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very happy with him. I will stake my life on him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be restored.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
It's going to break a broken branch. It's going to extinguish a weak flame. It's going to fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed and asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this. They said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil drives out the devil, it means he is fighting within himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Don't even think about it. How can you enter a strong man's house and take whatever he owns? You first need to tie him up. Then you can steal his stuff.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we
"Whatever blasphemy is spoken against the Son of Man will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit. A bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O den of vipers! How can you evil people say anything good? Your mouth speaks what is in your hearts.
A good man speaks good words. These words come from the goodness within him. An evil man speaks evil words. These words come from the evil within him.
As for Hani, I'll tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every reckless word they've spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, or by your words you will be condemned." The sign of Jonah.
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"Wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the men who are living now. And she will prove them guilty. She came from a great distance to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It wanders through dry places, looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
Then she says, 'Let's go back to the house I left.' When you get there, you find the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
"Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other evil spirits more wicked than itself. They go and live in the person, and the man's condition becomes worse than before. That is how it will be with these evil people today." - Jesus' mother and brothers.
While Issa was still talking to the group, his mother and brother were standing outside, wanting to speak with him.
They told me, "Your mother and your siblings are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!
Whoever does what my father wants in heaven is neither my brother nor my sister nor my mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. Everyone stood on the shore.
Then he said many things to them using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
Scattering seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some of the grains fell on rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil wasn't deep.
By the time the sun rose, it had scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
The last seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and overwhelmed the plants.
And other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times more than the others.
Those with two ears, let them hear.
The pupils came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
"You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. They have not been given to outsiders."
Everyone has this kind of knowledge to give more. In fact, they have a lot. And if no one has this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken from them.
That's why we use stories when we talk to people. I mean, they look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't hear or understand.
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"The hearts of these people are stubborn. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and return to the Lord, who would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
Your eyes are blessed because they see. And your ears are blessed because they hear.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! What is the meaning of the farmer's story?
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seed sown along the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they do not last for long. They quickly fall away from the faith when problems or suffering come their way because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the message. However, afterwards, the worries of the world and the deceitful promise of wealth overwhelm them. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
Others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop that is 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man sowed good seed in his field.
But when everyone was sleeping, the enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he replied. "The slaves asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?'"
"No," the owner replied, "When you pull out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat with them."
Let them grow together until the time of harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my barn." The Parable of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but it grows into the largest plant in the garden. It grows into a tree. Birds come and perch on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it worked its way through the whole batch of dough."
Jesus said all these things to the people using parables. He didn't tell them anything without a story.
Thus the word of the Lord came to him: "I will break the bars of your yoke and set you free from the kingdom of darkness. I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
The earth is the world. Good plants symbolize people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The grass is uprooted and burned in the fire. That's how it will be on Judgment Day.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all those who do evil.
He's going to throw them into the blazing oven. People are going to cry and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those who have ears listen. Stories of hidden treasure and the pearl.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very precious. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together every kind of fish.
When they had finished, the fishermen pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.
This is how the Day of Reckoning will be. The angels will come to distinguish between those who did wrong and those who did right.
So they could throw the evil people into the blazing oven. Those evil ones would cry and gnash their teeth.
Jesus asked, "Do you understand all these things?" They said, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus continued to tell these stories. Then he went away from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? When did this man get all these things?
They were not happy about it at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He who had done a few miracles went away because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
At that time, Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.
He said to those who were with him, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod imprisoned John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they thought John was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was greatly pleased with her.
He promised her by oath that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head lolled onto a large plate and they gave it to the girl. Then she took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. He went by boat to a quiet place. The people heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came down to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt great compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the pupils came to him. "There's nothing here," they said. "It's getting late. Dismiss the crowd. They can go buy some food in the villages."
Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said, "We have five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Then Jesus had the people sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
Everyone ate and rested. The students collected 12 baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
After dismissing them, he went alone to the side of a mountain to pray. When evening came, he was still there, alone.
The boat was already far from the shore. The waves were crashing against it as the wind howled in opposition.
Early in the morning, Jesus went to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were very afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
At once Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
At that moment, Jesus reached out his hand and grabbed him. He said to him, "You have so little faith! Why did you doubt me?"
As they got into the boat, the wind died down.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus, and said, "Truly You are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there came to know Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. The people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to let those who were sick touch even the fringe of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "Why don't you obey the command of God? Do you prefer to follow your own teachings?"
My father said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) And he added, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They don't have to honor their parents with their gift. You're making God's word of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
O protesters! Isaiah was right to prophesy about you. He said,
People honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean". It is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean".
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus replied, "No, otherwise they would uproot the weeds along with the wheat.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you still not understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus departed from Galilee and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Once a Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus didn't say a word. His disciples came to him. They pleaded with him, "Make her go away. She's always shouting after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell to her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
Replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, my Lord," she said. "Even dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus walked on from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people marveled. Those who could not speak began to speak. The disabled became healthy. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind began to see. This is how the people praised God, the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "Where shall we find enough bread here to feed so large a crowd?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
Take the seven loaves and the fish and give thanks. Then break them and give them to the disciples. And the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the students collected seven baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign or miracle from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'
In the morning, she says, "Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy." She knows what she sees in the sky. But she can't understand the signs that are happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
"Be careful," Jesus told them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about it among themselves. They said, "He must be saying that because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small. Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Still don't understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces were gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces were collected?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the yeast used in bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"And you?" he asked. "Who are you talking about? I?"
Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
How can I say this to you? You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you shut on earth will be shut in heaven, and whatever you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Then Jesus again warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus spoke of his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He said to them, "It is necessary for me to go to Jerusalem. There I will suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. I will be killed, and on the third day I colon
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What's the point of gaining the whole world and losing one's soul? Or what can one exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I am about to tell you is true. Some of the people standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus was transformed.
After six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James. He brought them up to a high mountain by themselves.
Before them, his form changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes turned white like light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they were very afraid. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they went up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do our religious teachers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "Yes, it is true. Elijah is coming to restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came to Jesus, knelt down before him.
"Oh my God," he said, "have mercy on my son. He trembles violently and is in great pain. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought it to my students. But they couldn't fix it.
Oh, you unbelieving and evil people! Jesus replied. How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy here to me.
Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed immediately.
Afterwards the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm telling you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.
"They will kill him. And on the third day he will rise again." Then the disciples were filled with grief. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. When they entered the temple, a tax collector came up to him and asked, "Teacher, does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he pays like that," you replied. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter replied. "Then the boys don't have to finish," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to upset them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find exactly the coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my taxes and yours.
