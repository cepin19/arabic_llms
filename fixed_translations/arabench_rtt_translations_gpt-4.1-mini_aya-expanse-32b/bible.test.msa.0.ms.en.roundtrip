Jesus called a little child to him. He made the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me.
"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Such things must come. But how terrible for those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
See that you do not despise one of these little ones. This is what I say to you. Their angels in heaven may at any time see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that went astray?
What I am telling you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be more glad about it than about the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
The same is true of your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
What I am going to tell you is the truth. What you close on earth will be closed in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy and seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When the king began, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to settle his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him and set him free.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay back what you owe!"
The other slave fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very disturbed by it. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then he called the first servant. He said to him, "O wicked servant, I forgave you all that you owed because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant, as I showed mercy to you?
In his anger, his lord delivered him to the jailers. He would be punished until he had paid back all he owed.
Thus will my Father in heaven do also to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning God made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a man a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
Here's what I tell you. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining celibate. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Little children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all those commandments, what else should I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go, you also, into my vineyard. I will give you what is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The hired workers came around five o'clock. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
When those who were hired first came, they thought they would receive more, and each of them also received a denarius.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "These newly hired people only worked for one hour. You paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend," he said, "I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to pay the ones I hired last the same wage I paid you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave generously to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first last." Jesus again predicts His upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. They will mock him and beat him. They will crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
Jesus said, "What do you want?" She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know how the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like this. Rather, whoever wants to be important among you should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
They said, "O Lord, we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says something to you, say that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them the money right away.
This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
Say to the city of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you, righteous and saved, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
Bring the donkey and the colt. Put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
Very large crowds spread out and placed their coats on the road. Others cut branches from trees and placed them on the road.
Some people went before him, and others followed. And they all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
He answered the crowds, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of thieves.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
The blind and the disabled came to Jesus in the temple. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked Jesus. "Yes," Jesus replied. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? 'You have taught children and infants to give you praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowd and went away from the town to Bethany, where he spent the night. When he saw a fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" At once the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done.
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued with each other about it. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We fear people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Story of the Two Sons
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do it," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed. I have seen this. But even then you did not repent of your sins and believe in him. Parable of the Tenants
Listen to another story. A man owned some land. He planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it. He dug a pit for a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He said to the servants, "Gather my share of the fruit."
But the tenants caught his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then he sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; let's kill him, and then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
They said, "These evil people will destroy it." Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the produce at harvest time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
And I tell you this: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who hits that stone will be dashed to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said,
Thus the kingdom of heaven is like a wedding banquet, for which the king invited many guests.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The others seized his servants. They treated them harshly and then killed them.
The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner everyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike. And soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there not wearing wedding clothes.
He said to him, "My friend, how did you enter here without your wedding clothes?" The man could not find anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness. There he will weep and gnash his teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made plans to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't let others tell you what to do or say. You don't care about their status.
So tell us, then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay the tax. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. The dead do not marry.
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and all the way to the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
If the dead rise, with which wife will he be? For they all had married her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has said to you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at what he taught. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
He said to him, "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." Who is the son of whom?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'my Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
If David called him 'Lord,' how can he be David's son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So you must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves don't mind lifting a finger to move them.
All they do is for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at banquets. They also love to get the most important seats in Jewish temples.
They love to be welcomed in the markets. They love it when people call them "my Lord."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father. You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher.' You have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
"How terrible it will be for you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to."
(No
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? For you travel across land and sea to make a single convert, and then you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Oh, you blind guides! How great is your hypocrisy! You say, "Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to keep his oath."
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
And it is also said, "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he must keep his oath."
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it giving? Or the altar that sanctifies giving?
So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
You hypocrites, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O you blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
You hypocritical teachers of the law and Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
O blind Persian! First clean the inside of the cup and plate. Then the outside will also be clean.
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of the bones of the dead and all sorts of filth.
The same goes for you. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be what you're not.
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore, I am sending you prophets and sages and scribes, some of
And you say, "If we had been in the days of those before us, we would not have killed the prophets, nor would we have been among the wrongdoers."
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So you complete the sins which were started by those before you!
O nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to exile in hell?
Behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
Therefore you shall pay the penalty for the blood of every righteous person who has been murdered on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house has been left empty.
"I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' " (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Beware! Take care that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be alarmed. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will fall away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For the abundance of wickedness will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, and it will serve as a testimony to all the nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that causes desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get something.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
How terrible it will be in those days for pregnant women! How terrible for nursing mothers!
Pray you never have to flee in winter or on a Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than anything from the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If anyone tells you, 'He is in the wilderness,' do not go out. And if they say, 'He is in the inner room,' do not believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a dead carcass.
After the terrible suffering in those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from the ends of the heavens to the ends of the heavens.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It is at the door.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The people who were living at that time will surely not die until all those things happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour."
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
"So be awake, for you do not know what day your Lord will come."
You must understand one thing. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have stayed awake. He wouldn't have allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a master entrusted one of his slaves with managing the rest of the slaves in his household. The slave's job is to distribute their food to them at the right time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise slave for this task.
It would be good for the servant if he found the lady doing his work when the master returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Mr. Smith will make him responsible for everything he owns.
But suppose that servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is away for a long time."
Suppose he starts beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that servant will return on a day when the servant does not expect him. He will come back at an hour the servant does not know.
Then Mr. will cut him into pieces. He will send him to the place where protesters go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Bridesmaids
Thus shall the kingdom of heaven be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The fools took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready with him went into the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Later, the other bridesmaids also came. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I will tell you is the truth. I don't know you."
"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. The parable of the three servants."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a king, which went to make a reckoning with his servants.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. He gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 went at once and put his money to work. He gained another $10,000.
The person who got $4000 made an additional $4000.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His master answered him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man with $4000 also came. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I've made another $4000."
His master answered and said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!'
Then the man who received the two thousand dollars came. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a hard man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not plant seeds.
So you were afraid. You went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is yours.
His master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed?
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I return, I would have received it with interest.
Then the master commanded the other servants, "Take 2000 dollars from him. Give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars.
To those who have, more will be given. They will have more than enough. What about those who have not? Even what they have will be taken from them.
'Drive that worthless servant out into the outer darkness. There, in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.' Sheep and goats
The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate the people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will make the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me in.
I was in need of clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
Then the righteous will answer them, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? When did we see you in need of a garment and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The king will answer, "What I tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.'
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not let me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not care for me.
They also asked, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and not feed you? Or thirsty and not give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and not welcome you, or needing clothes and not clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will answer, "What I am telling you is the truth. Whatever you did not do for any of these least ones, you did not do for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had a skin disease, at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. They said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at his house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The pupils became very sad. One after another, they began to say to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this, all of you, and eat it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I am telling you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night you are all going to fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Everyone else might leave because of you. But I will never do that."
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I will never deny you, even if I have to die with you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples, and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into temptation when you are tried. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he prayed to the same effect.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Rise up! Let us go! Here is he who betrays me to them!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who would betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the one. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword. He drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away. Those who live by the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how then will the scriptures be fulfilled? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Do you think I would lead a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Would you have to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I have been sitting in the temple courts teaching every day, yet you have not laid a hand on me."
But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus is taken before the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men are accusing you of?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes. Just as you say," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard him speak this evil word.
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But before everyone, Peter said it wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. There another woman saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said that he wasn't. He swore and said, "I don't know the man!"
A little later, those who were standing there approached Peter. They said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and led him away, and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I have made a mistake. I have delivered an innocent man." They replied, "What is it to us? That is your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, "It is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It is blood money. He bought the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy a potter's field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken were fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel.
"They paid the potter what the Lord had told them to pay." (Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is brought before Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is as you say."
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he made no reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose the person they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner called Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Don't get involved with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered greatly in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
"Which one do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
Pilate asked, "What shall I do then with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify Him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was making no progress. Instead, the crowd began to grow angry. So he took water and washed his hands before them. He said, "I am innocent of this man's blood." They said, "You are responsible!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he ordered Jesus to be flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They returned his own clothes to him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and guarded him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two other men, criminals, were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and build it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. May God save him now if He wills. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. And Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. So was the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock himself. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
"Therefore give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
Pilate said, "Take soldiers. Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now the Sabbath had ended. At dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, filled with fear and joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him money. This will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders to Jesus for his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshipped him. But some still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people of the Judean countryside and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so mighty that I am not worthy to stoop down and tie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for forty days. There the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets and followed him immediately.
Then Jesus walked a little further ahead. As he did so, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and they went after Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes. He did not speak like the teachers of the law.
At that moment, a man in their midst cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
And all the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With authority, he even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him!"
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. Her fever had abated. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many evil spirits. But he did not allow the spirits to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was very early in the morning, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. He was teaching in their synagogues, and casting out demons. Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he pleaded with Jesus. He said, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." "Be clean!"
Immediately the disease left him. He was healed.
Jesus sent him away immediately. He gave the man a severe warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people still came to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had returned to his hometown.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no room left, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?
Is it easier to say to this man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your bed and walk'?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
He said to him, "I say to you, rise, take up your mat, and go to your house."
The man rose and took up his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great multitude came to him, and he taught them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees fast often and pray. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast and pray, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast and pray. But yours do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will separate from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will be spilled, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins. "Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath."
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through the grain fields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
It was at the time when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he also gave some of the bread to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
For the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Jesus went again into the synagogue. And there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and crooked hand. He said to him, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was greatly disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. Large crowds from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would keep people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick were pushing to touch him.
When the people saw those possessed by evil spirits, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up on a mountainside. He called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They had the power to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them, and Jesus named him Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedes, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. A crowd gathered again. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. They went to take charge of him. They said, "He is out of his mind."
There were some scribes who came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
So He invited them to come closer and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom is at war with itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
