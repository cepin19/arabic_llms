Jesus called a little child and brought him to him. He had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

For a small child to receive me with my name like this, it means they are receiving me.
But if anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
How sad the world will be because of the things that make people commit sins! Things like that should not happen. But how sad are those who cause them!
Unless your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. The fire of hell burns forever.
If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't you dare look down on any of these children. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my Father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Won't he leave the 99 sheep on the mountains and go look for the lost one?
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he'll be happier about that one than about the 99 that weren't lost.
The same goes for your Father in heaven. He doesn't want even one of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother has wronged you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you've won him over.
But what if he won't listen to you? Take one or two others along with you, for every matter must be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he also refuses to listen to the witnesses? After telling the church. And if even the church refuses to listen to him? After they don't treat him as a brother. They treat him as they would treat someone without religion or a tax collector.
What I'm about to tell you is true. What is closed on earth will be closed in heaven. And what is opened on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, this is what I am telling you. Suppose two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, my Father who is in heaven will do it for you.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his servants owed him.
The king started doing it from me, a man who had millions of dollars came to him.
The man couldn't pay. So his creditor gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he owned had to be sold to repay his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
Sido regretted it. He forgave him for what he had done and let him go.
But later, that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few coins. He grabbed him and started choking him. He said, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant fell on his knees. He said to him, "Give me time, I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he walked away and left the man to be imprisoned until he could pay back what he owed.
The other slaves saw what happened. This made them very upset. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
After the master called the first slave. He said to him: "O wicked slave, I have forgiven you for everything you owed me because you asked me."
Why didn't you show mercy to the other servant as you were shown mercy?
So anger, its master handed over to the prison guards. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Isa is teaching about divorce.
Then Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Many crowds followed him. He healed them there.
They sent some Pharisees to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh.' (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
Solo, "Why, after Moses, was it commanded that a man could give his wife a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I'm telling you. A man who divorces his wife and marries others is committing adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him.
The students told him, "If that's how the relationship between a man and a woman is, it's better we don't get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some make themselves that way because of others. And others make themselves that way to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can live that way should do so." The little children came to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Don't stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
Why do you ask me what is good? Jesus answered. There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, follow the commandments.
"Which one of them?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have kept all these commandments," the young man said. "What else do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the pupils heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
He looked at them and said, "With man, this is impossible. But with God, all things are possible."
Replied Peter, "We've left everything to follow you! What will you give us in return?"
Jesus said to them, "What I am about to tell you is true. When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. And then, those of you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a piece of land. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual day wage. Then he sent them to the vineyard.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw other people standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "You too, go work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is right."
They left. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock he did the same thing.
Around five in the evening, he went out and found other people standing nearby. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day and done nothing?"
"There's no one left to serve us," they replied. He told them, "You keep going and work in Kermi."
This evening, the vineyard owner spoke to the person in charge of the workers. He said to him, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Start with those you paid last. Then go to those you paid first."
The workers who quit around five in the afternoon came. Each one received the daily wage for a regular day.
When the replacements arrived, those who had been working longer expected to get more. But each of them was paid the same daily wage as usual.
From me they receive it, they start complaining to the owner.
They said: "These people who quit worked only one hour," they said. "We finished it like them. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day."
The owner answered one of them. He said to him, "My friend, I'm being fair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the regular daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give back what I took from you with the same relief you gave me.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because you've given a lot to others?
"Those who will be last will be first, and those who will be first will be last." Isa is retelling his impending death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to talk with them.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"They will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. The people will mock him and beat him. They will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. Falling at his feet, she asked him for something.
Jesus asked her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
Jesus said to them, "What are you asking me?" He said, "Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered him, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or at my left. Those places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They turned against the brothers.
Jesus gathered them together and said to them, "You know the rulers of the Gentiles, who lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Don't be like that. On the contrary, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men watched.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, so they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The assembly ordered them to stop. They were told to be quiet. But the two men shouted louder, "Oh God! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt great compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed Him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus called two disciples and said to them,
He told them, "Go to the village in front of you. When you arrive, you will find a donkey tied up. Its foal will be with it. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The owner will send them now.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. They say,
Say to the city of Zion, "Behold, your king is coming to you. He is humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and its colt. They put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large number of people spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead, and some followed. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was driving the people out of the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all the people who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. He also overturned the chairs of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind people and those who were disabled came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
See the chief priests and the teachers of the law! What wonderful things he did! Even children were shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when the chief priests and teachers saw it, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you ever read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Afterward Jesus went away from the people and entered into the temple. And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
So early in the morning, Jesus was returning to the city of Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what has been done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where does the baptism of John come from? Is it from heaven, or is it from men?" They argued with each other about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
Jesus answered them, "I do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." Mark 11:33
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I'm not going," the boy answered. But then he changed his mind and went.
After the father went to the other son, he told him the same thing. The son answered, "I will do it, sir." But he didn't go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. But you didn't believe him. However, the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. I saw this. But even now, you have not repented of your sins and do not believe him. The story of the tenant.
He heard another story. About a man who had a piece of land, planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a winepress, and even constructed a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers and then went on a journey.
As the harvest time approached, he sent his children to the fields. He told them to gather his share of the fruits.
But the crowd turned violent. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
And after that, the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than the first time, and the tenants treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his children there. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the servants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit the owner's entire fortune one day. Let's kill him, and then everything will be ours."
He betrayed him and they expelled him from the vineyard. Then they killed him.
From me comes the owner of the vineyard, what will he do with these grapes?
"He will destroy those worthless people," they answered. "Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
This is what I am going to tell you: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken into pieces. But the stone will destroy anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew what he was talking about.
Now they were looking for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Feast Story
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
How is it like the kingdom of heaven? A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He invited his friends for dinner. They declined the invitation even though they were told to come.
And then he sent other servants. He said to them, "Tell those whom you invite, 'I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my fattened cattle and my fat animals. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest, he kept them busy. He treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed these murderers and burned down their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Go to the corners of the streets. Call out to anyone you find for dinner.
Now the people have come out onto the street. They gathered all the people they could find, whether they were good or bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests. He noticed a man who wasn't wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," Sol said, "How did you get in here without wearing your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't find anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There people will weep and gnash their teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Should we pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made a plan to entrap Jesus in His words.
"Send your disciples to him. Send the Herodians with them." "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't let anyone tell you what to do or say. You don't care how important they are."
Tell us now, what do you think? Do you pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said to them, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay their taxes." He was shown silver coins.
"Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away. The dead rise from the grave.
On the same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people would rise from the dead after they died.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his brother's name."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God.
"Those who have died and risen again will not marry. Their parents will not give them anything to marry. They will be like angels in heaven."
What about the dead who rise? Haven't you read what God told you?
He said, 'I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the people heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been unable to answer Jesus. So they gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. He tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "What is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"And the second is like it. 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)"
"Everything written in the Sharia and by the prophets is based on these two commandments." Who is the son of whom, Christ?
The Pharisees were assembled. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
Ella Davidson called him "Sir," how could he be Davidson's son?
Not even one person could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't be like them. They don't do what they advise.
They lift heavy weights and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves don't even want to move a finger to carry them.
Everything they do, they do it for people to see. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they wear their coat sleeves very long.
They like to sit in the place of honor at dinner. And they love to have the best seats in the synagogue.
They go crazy when they meet each other in the market. They go crazy when people call them 'Lord'.
But you shall not be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on earth "Father." You have one Father, and he is in heaven.
You shall not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important one among you will be your servant.
He who raises his head will fall. And he who falls will be lifted up.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
(No
How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are.
How terrible this is for you, you blind guides! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
You're blind and stupid! What's more important? Gold? Or the structure that sanctifies the gold?
As you say, "If someone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But whoever swears by the gift on it is obliged to keep the oath."
Oh, you blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And he who swears by the sky, swears by the throne of God and He who sits upon it.
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former."
Oh blind leaders! You strain out the smallest gnat from your food, but you swallow a camel whole!
How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
Blind man, O Persian! Clean the inside of the glass and the first plate. Then the outside will also become clean.
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."
The same thing with you. From the outside, it seems like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of wrong things. You're just pretending to be someone you're not.
How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
As you say, 'If we were living in the times of those who lived before us, we wouldn't have done what they did. We wouldn't have aided in the killing of the prophets.'
So you bear witness against yourselves. You say that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
May the sins of those who lived before you be forgiven!
O den of venomous snakes! How will you escape the punishment of Hell?
I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. And you will persecute some of them from city to city.
You will pay for the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this is going to happen to the people living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
As I have been telling you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalms 118:26)
End marks
Jesus walked away from the temple. As he was going, his disciples came to him to point out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Be careful! Beware of deception."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. These things have to happen. But the end is not yet here.
Loneliness will fight loneliness. The king will fight the king. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
These are all the beginnings of labor pains.
And then they will hand you over to be mistreated and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will appear. They will deceive many people.
Wherever evil increases, people's love will decrease a lot.
But those who endure until the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader needs to understand this.
And afterward, those who are Jewish will have to flee to the mountains.
Not even one person on the roof goes down to his house to get something out.
No one in the field goes back to take their jacket.
How hard the days will be for pregnant women! How hard they will be for nursing mothers!
Don't let her have to run away in the winter or on Saturdays.
There will be great suffering in these days. It will be worse than anything that has happened since the beginning of the world until now. And nothing like it will ever happen again.
Unless time is shortened, no one will live. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
No one can tell you, "Look! Here is Christ!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
They will appear as false Christians and false prophets. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the people whom God has chosen, if they can.
See, I told you before.
To what extent did he tell you, "He's far in the desert," don't go there. Or if anyone says, "He's deep inside the house," don't believe this talk.
The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a dead corpse.
Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the peoples of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen people from all four corners of the earth. They will come from the ends of the heavens to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you discover all these things are happening, you know the end is near. It's right by the door.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The people who were living at that time will not die until all those events have taken place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Consider how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
For the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They didn't know anything about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women are going to grind with a hand mill. One will be taken and the other will remain.
So keep your eyes open, you never know when your Lord will come.
You have to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew how much time at night the thief comes. He would stay awake. He wouldn't let his house be robbed.
You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
Assuming that Sayyid appointed one of his servants in charge of the rest of the servants in his house. The servant's duty is to provide them with their food at the appropriate time. Sayyid wants an honest and wise servant for this task.
It would be good for the servant if he found the master doing his work when he returns.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The man is going to leave that servant in charge of everything he has.
But let's assume that servant is lazy. Let's assume he thinks to himself, "My master will be away for a long time."
Supposedly, he was hitting the other servants. And supposedly, he was eating and drinking with the people who drink a lot.
The master will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
After Mr. Gadi, they will be cut into pieces. They will be sent to the place they claim to go to. There, people will cry and gnash their teeth.
"A Tale of Ten Brides"
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
Fools carry their lamps, but they don't bring olive oil with them.
The believers took the oil in their bottles with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted, "Here comes the groom! Come out to greet him!"
And then they woke up all the brides and turned on their lights.
The fools said to the wise men, "Give us some of your oil. Our candles are going to go out."
"No," they replied. "It might not be enough for all of us. Instead of going to them, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for yourselves."
They went to buy oil. But on their way, the groom arrived. The girls who were present went in with him to the wedding dinner. And then the door was closed.
Afterwards, the other brides came too. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But answer, "What I'm going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
Be careful. I don't know the day or the hour the groom will come. The story of three servants.
Again, it will be like a man going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted them with his property.
He gave one man $10,000. He gave another man $4,000. And he gave the third man $2,000. The man gave each servant the amount he knew they could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The man who invested $10,000 went now and put his money to work. He made an additional $10,000.
He who has $4000 earns $4000 more.
But the man who took the $2000 walked away and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who was given $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made an extra $10,000."
Mr. Diallo replied, "You have done well, Abdou, a good and faithful servant! You were faithful in a few things. I will give you charge over many things. Come and share in your master's joy!"
The man with $4000 came too. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I made an extra $4000."
Mr. Diallo replied, "You have done well, Abdou, a good and faithful servant! You were faithful in a few things. I will give you charge over many things. Come and share in your master's joy!"
Then came the man who received $2000. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather the harvest where you did not scatter the seed."
I was scared. I went out and buried $2000 in the ground. Look, this is your stuff.
"You foolish and lazy servant!" replied Mr. Diallo. "Didn't you know that I was harvesting where I hadn't sown? Didn't you know that I was gathering the crop where I hadn't planted?"
Yes, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I was going to retrieve it with interest.
And then the master commanded the other servants, "Take $2,000 from him and give it to the one who has $20,000.
Everyone will be given more. They will have more than enough. What about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have it taken away from them.
"Drive that worthless slave out into the darkness, where people will weep and gnash their teeth." 'The Sheep and the Goats'
The Son of Man is going to come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups, just like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
I needed a hajj, and you gave it to me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'"
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you lacking and give you things?
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?
The king is going to answer, "What I am about to tell you now is the truth. Anything you have done to one of my least important brothers, you have done to me."
He will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you didn't invite me in. I needed a lawyer. But you didn't provide me with one. I was sick and in prison. But you didn't comfort me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger and naked and sick and in prison and did not help you?'
He will answer, "What I am going to tell you is true. Anything I haven't done to one of the least important of these people, I haven't done to you."
They will go away into eternal punishment, but those who have done good will obtain eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
"Sally said Jesus from saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,"
As you know, Easter is only two days away. The Son of Man is about to be crucified.
Afterward, the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
The chief priests plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But not during the holiday, they said. People might cause trouble. A woman sprays perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was seated at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.
He knew that. He told them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She did something good for me."
The poor you will always have with you, but me you will not always have.
Pouring perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I'm about to tell you is true. What she did will be said wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world. It will be said in her memory." Judas agreed to hand Jesus over.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
"What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" they asked. They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time, Judas was waiting for the opportune moment to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
"Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, "My time is near. I will celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples."' "
Now the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
This evening, Isa was with the children at the table.
As they were eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you is going to hand me over to my enemies."
The students looked very sad. One after another, they began to tell him, "Not me, sir, right?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
The Son of Man must go as it is written of Him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Rabbi, right?" Jesus answered, "Yes, you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it. He gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this bread and eat it. This is my body."
After God, the cup. Thank God and give it to them. He said, "Everyone eat from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I will tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "You will deny me."
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after we wake up from death, we will go ahead of you to Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone else can leave you. But I'll never change."
Jesus said to him, "What I am about to tell you is true. Tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never say I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus was praying in Gethsemane.
Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
Then he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him. He began to be sorrowful and troubled.
And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell with his face to the ground. He cried, "Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet not what I want, but what you want."
And then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to them, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" Peter asked.
Stay awake and pray. So that you don't make mistakes when temptation comes. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus walked again. He called out, "Father, if this cup can pass by, but if I must drink it, let it be done as you wish."
After that, he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and walked away again. For the third time he called for the same thing.
And he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! Here comes the one who will hand me over to them!" Jesus was arrested.
And Jesus still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. He had a large crowd with him. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, had agreed with them on a signal. He said, "The one I kiss is the man. Seize him."
Judas walked up to Jesus immediately and said to him, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
In that moment, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword. He went out and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "All who draw the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think we can't ask Dad for help? He can send an army of over 70,000 skilled kings.
But how can the scriptures be fulfilled? They say it must be done this way.
"I gave you time, Jesus said to the crowd. 'Am I leading a band of armed men against you? Why do you need swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I was in the temple courts, teaching, and you did not arrest me.'"
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the courtyard of the high priest, where he sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses appeared.
They said, "That man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes. As you say," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
And afterward, the high priest tore his garments, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You heard him say this blasphemy."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" he answered.
And then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant woman came to him. She said to him, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
But in front of them all, Peter said he would. "I don't know what you're saying," he said.
And then he went out to the gate that led to the courtyard. There he saw the woman again. She told the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said, "I don't know him." And with an oath he said, "I do not know the man!"
A little later, the people who were standing there went to Peter. They said to him, "You must be one of them. Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear. He vowed, "I don't know that man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
Afterward, Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it crows, you will disown me three times." Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas is hanging himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt great shame and regret for what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I convicted an innocent man." "Why should we care?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Now Judas threw the money in the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests collected the money. They said, "This money is blood money, and it is not lawful to put it into the treasury. It was paid for the life of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries will come to visit there.
Why is that place still called the Field of Blood today?
And after that the word which Jeremiah the prophet spoke was fulfilled, saying, "They gave thirty pieces of silver. This was the price set by the sons of Israel.
"They paid the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
After Pilate had said this, "Do you refuse to listen to the charges they have brought against you?"
But Jesus did not answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was very surprised.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whoever they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
"Then Pilate went outside to the people and asked, 'What do you want me to do with the one you call the king of the Jews? Should I 'release' Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?'"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew this was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message: "Have nothing to do with that innocent man. I have suffered greatly in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which of the two do you want me to divorce?" asked the governor. "Both," they answered.
Pilate said, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" Pilate asked. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and with a flourish he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he declared. "It is your responsibility!"
Answer to everyone, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but had Jesus scourged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple jalabiya.
And after, they took the thorns to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They gave him a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him. They said, "We honor you, King of the Jews!"
They kept hitting him on the head with a stick over and over again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and gave him his clothes back. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Kairouan. His name was Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
He came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter herbs and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
They poured out my wine on the ground, they divided my garments among them by casting lots.
They sat and guarded him there.
They put the written accusation against him on his head, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and laughed at him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, teachers of the law and elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. God will save him now if He wants to. He is the one who said, 'I am the Son of God.'
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the people standing there heard Jesus calling. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with sour wine and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out in a loud voice again, he died.
In that moment, the temple's curtain tore from top to bottom. The earth shook. The stones cracked.
Tombs were opened. Many bodies of saints who had died came back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there as well. So was the mother of Zebed's children. Jesus is buried.
As the evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who had also become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed it in his new grave that he had carved into the rock. He put a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards of the tomb
The day after was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again and live.'"
"Give the order to secure the tomb until the third day. If you don't, his disciples could come and steal the body, and then they'll go and tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. That last lie will be worse than the first one."
"Take a few guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
They went and made the tomb secure. They put a seal on the stone and posted guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
On Saturday morning. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. An angel from the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone that was blocking the entrance and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they froze and became like statues.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
He's not here! As he said, he's gone! Come and see the place where he was sleeping.
Hurry! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there.' I have told you.
Now the women had gone far from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were also very joyful. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, grabbed his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there." The guards went and reported to the chief priests.
While the women were on the road, some of the guards went to the city. They told the high priests everything that had happened.
The high priests met with the elders and devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
As soon as the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That way, you'll stay out of trouble.
Now the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been known among the Jews to this day. The last orders of Jesus to his disciples.
After that, eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
They saw me, they worshiped me. But there are still some who have doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
You shall go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything, even what I command you. And be confident that I am always with you, until the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight his paths." (Isaiah 40:3)
And John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the people came to him, and he baptized them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven has come near. Repent, and believe in the good news."
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. Even people from Jerusalem went. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
"This is what John was preaching. 'After me comes one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thongs of his sandals.'
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus was baptized and tempted.
Then Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven. It said, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very proud of you."
Immediately the Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
The temptation in the desert lasted 40 days. There, the devil tested him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately, they opened their windows and followed him.
Then Jesus went a little further. As he walked, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them. He left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and they went after Jesus. As Jesus was getting into a boat, a man with an unclean spirit met him.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went to the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He didn't speak like the scribes.
"In your service, a man in their temple cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,"
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with great authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread rapidly throughout Galilee. Jesus treated many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The heat had gotten to her. Then she started serving them.
In the evening, after sunset, all the people brought to Jesus those who were sick and those possessed by demons.
Gather all the people in the city in front of the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let them speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus often withdrew to solitary places.
It was still very early in the morning and dark. Issa got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
They found him, they called out to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns, so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
He traveled far and wide. He preached in their temples. He even cast out demons. Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged Jesus. He said to him, "If you want to heal me and make my skin clean, you can do it."
Jesus was filled with great compassion. He reached out and touched the man. He said to him, "I am willing. Be clean!"
The disease left him immediately. He recovered.
Jesus dismissed him now. He gave him a strong warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Don't show your face to the priest. Perform the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to spread the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people kept coming to him from all directions.
Jesus healed a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had returned home.
A lot of people gathered, until there was no more room. There was no space even outside the door. And Jesus was preaching to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the man on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something really bad! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew what they were thinking in their hearts. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I desire you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the man who was unable to walk,
"I'm telling you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and rolled up his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched in amazement. They all marveled and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose the one who was lame.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
As he went, Jesus saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was eating at the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law who were present saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. They asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." They asked him about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples were fasting and praying. Some people came to Jesus and said, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast and pray, but yours do not. Why don't they fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast."
But there will come a time when the groom will take them away. On that day, they will leave without eating.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do that, the new piece will tear away from the old one. This will only increase the tear.
"People don't put new wine in old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the old skins, and both the wine and the skins will be lost. No, they put new wine in new wineskins." Jesusüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfüfü
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pick some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
Reply, "Have you never read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
There was a time when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David even gave some to his men.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
For the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath day.
Healing on Saturday
Once again Jesus went into the synagogue. There was a man there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were watching Jesus, looking for something to criticize him about. They were observing him closely, eager to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and distorted hand. He said to him, "Stand up in front of everyone."
After Jesus asked them, "What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked at them with anger; he was very upset because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
After the Pharisees went out, they began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, wanting to kill him. The crowds were following Jesus.
Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A great crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, and the surrounding regions, including Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and the area around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to find a small boat for him. This would keep people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. That's why those who were sick were pushing to touch him.
The people who had evil spirits in them saw him, and they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who he was. Jesus appointed twelve apostles.
He climbed a mountain. He called for specific people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They will have authority to drive out demons.
Then Jesus appointed twelve, and Simon was one of them. Jesus named him Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John were given the name "Boanerges" by Jesus, which means "sons of thunder."
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. There were also Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered the house. Once again a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take care of him. They said, "He's sick in the head."
There were some religious teachers there. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is bound by Beelzebul! And by the power of the prince of demons he casts out demons."
Jesus came and called them, and spoke to them in parables. He said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
If the kingdom is fighting itself, it won't stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
