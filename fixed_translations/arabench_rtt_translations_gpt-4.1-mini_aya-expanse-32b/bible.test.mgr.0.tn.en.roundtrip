If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with two hands and two feet. For the fire of hell is always burning.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't underestimate any of these poor people. I'm telling you, their angels in heaven can come at any time to see my father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Let's say a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Would he leave the 99 sheep in the mountains and go search for the lost one?
What I'm going to tell you is true. If he found that sheep, he would be more joyful about it than the 99 that did not wander off.
The same goes for your father in heaven. He doesn't like any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.
But what if he won't listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The Bible says, "On the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But if they refuse to listen even to the church, let them be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
What I'm going to tell you is true. What you close on earth will be closed in heaven, and what you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, this is what we are telling you. Suppose two of you on earth agree on anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The servant who has no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
As soon as the king started doing it, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay. For this reason, the owner gave him an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all he possessed had to be sold to pay off the debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll put everything back."
Sido felt pity for him. He forgave him for what he owed and let him go.
After this, the servant went out and met one of the other servants who owed him a little money. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other slave fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he walked away and left the man in prison. The man will remain in prison until he collects the money and pays back the debt.
The other slaves saw what happened. They were very upset. They went and told their master everything that happened.
Then the master called the first servant. He said to him, "Wicked servant, I forgave you all that you owed me because you asked me."
You should not have shown mercy to the other slave as you were shown mercy.
In anger, his master handed him over to the guards to be punished until he repaid everything.
This is how your Father in heaven will treat you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches on divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. They saw him going.
Then some Pharisees came to him and tested him, asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined together.
They asked, "Why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a divorce certificate and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because you were so hard-hearted. But it was not like that from the beginning.
How can I tell you? A man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife if she is not faithful to him.
The students told him, "That's how it was between men and women, it's better we don't get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been given the gift of living without marriage can accept it."
"Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some became that way because of others. And others made themselves that way to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so." Bring the little children to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went on from there with his disciples. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which one?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all these commandments. What more do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he walked away sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "So who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who follow me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or fathers or children or lands for my sake and for the gospel will receive a hundred times more now in this present age, along with eternal life.
Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Tale of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a field. Early in the morning, he went out to hire laborers to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the regular wage for the day's work. Then he sent them to Karmo.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw other people standing in the market and not doing anything.
He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you what is right.'
They walked. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock, and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found other people standing. He asked them, 'Why are you sitting here all day long and doing nothing?'
They said, "Because no one has hired us." He said, "You too, go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired, and then the others."
The workers who finished around five o'clock came. Each of them received the regular daily wage.
Since the people who came to work first were expecting to get more, each of them also received the usual daily wage in addition.
As soon as they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said: "These people who were appointed last time only worked for an hour. You paid them as much as us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner answered one of them. He said, "My friend, I'll be fair with you. Didn't we agree that you would work for the regular wage?"
Take your money and leave. We'd like to give those who come after you the same treatment we gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? I feel like I've cheated you because I've been generous to everyone else?
"Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Isa repeats, speaking of his impending death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"Let's go to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. They will mock him and beat him and crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes' children came to Jesus. Her children came with her. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
Jesus said, "What do you want?" She said, "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other will sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking." They said to him, "Can we drink the cup that you will drink?" They said, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten disciples heard about it. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them together and said, "You know the rulers of the Gentiles, for they have power over their people, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
It shouldn't be like that. On the contrary, whoever wants to be important among you should be your servant.
And whoever loves to be first among you must be your servant.
The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many. Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd was following them.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd was ordered to stand still. They were told to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Oh my God," they replied, "We hope we can see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed Him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs them. The Master will send them right away.
This happened in order to fulfill what the prophet said. He said,
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you. He is humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus had told them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead, and some followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heavens!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all the people who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind people and those with disabilities came to Jesus in the temple. He healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the amazing things he did, and when they saw the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you ever read in the Scriptures, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went away from the multitude, and came to the sea of Galilee; and there he went up into a mountain, and
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He walked to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority was questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you one more question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks John was a prophet.
So Jesus answered them, "I do not know you." And Jesus said to them, "Therefore I tell you, I will not show you the authority by which I do these things." The story of the two sons.
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do it," the boy answered. But then he changed his mind and left.
Then the father went to the second son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered him, "I will do it, sir." But he didn't go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But when the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him, you saw it. Yet even then, you did not repent of your sins and believe in him. The story of the tenant.
Hear another story. A man had a small plot of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a pit to make a wine press. He also built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the harvest time drew near, he sent his slaves to the tenants. He told the slaves to gather his share of the fruits.
But the monks attacked them. They beat one of them. They killed another one. They threw stones at the third one to kill him.
After that, the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
When the servants saw the boy coming, they said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit the owner's entire fortune one day. Let's kill him, and then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
What will the landlord do for these tenants when he returns?
They said, "He will destroy these wicked people." They said, "Then, He will lease the vineyard to other tenants. They will give Him His share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
How then shall we say, The kingdom of God is come unto you? or, The time is at hand? Repent ye, and believe the gospel.
Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken into pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew He was speaking about them.
They sought a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Isa told them more stories. He said,
How the kingdom of heaven is like: A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his slaves to those he invited to dinner. The slaves told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent some more slaves. He said, "Tell those who are preparing to come that I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my fattened calves and all is ready. Come to the wedding feast."
As for the people, they didn't pay attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest tightened their belts. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his armies to destroy them. These murderers were killed and their city was burned.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready. But those who were invited were not worthy to come."
Walk to the corners of the streets. Invite anyone you meet for dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, whether good or bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man present who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man had nothing to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Do we really pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made plans to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, nor do you cater to the whims of the powerful.
Let's say now, what's your opinion? Do you really pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay their taxes." He brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away. Marriage wakes the dead.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Professor," they said, "this is what Moses commanded us: When a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother shall marry the widow. He must father sons for his brother, to keep his brother's name alive."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened exactly to the seventh brother as well.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will you be? All seven of them were married to you.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
"They will not marry, nor will their parents marry them for them. They will be like the angels in heaven."
What's your opinion on the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what the Lord has told you?
He said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the people heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So Jesus asked him a question to test him.
"Professor," he asked, "what is the most important commandment in the Sharia?"
Jesus answered, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." Who is the son of whom?
The Pharisees were assembled. Jesus asked them,
"What is your opinion about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" they asked him. "The son of David," he declared.
He told them, "Why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "my lord," how can he be David's son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do as they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy weights and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves don't even want to move a finger to carry them.
Everything they do is for people to see. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they lengthen the fringes on their coats a lot.
They like to sit in the place of honor at dinners. They also like to have the most important chairs in the synagogue.
They like to be greeted in the markets. They like when people call them 'Master'.
You don't have to call yourself "Lord". You have only one Lord, and you are all brothers.
You cannot call anyone on earth "Father." You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called "teacher." You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you is the one who will serve you.
He who raises himself will fall, and he who falls will rise.
You blind guides! You Pharisees! You hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are entering go in.
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
How terrible it is for you, blind guides! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
You're blind and stupid! What's more important, gold or the temple that worships gold?
Zada says, "If someone swears by the altar, it holds no value. But if someone swears by the gift upon it, they must keep their oath."
You blind fools! Which is more important, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and everything on it.
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And everyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh blind leaders! You strain out the gnat from your food, but swallow a camel!
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore, clean the inside of the cup and dish, for outside they are already clean. You hypocrites! You give a tenth of mint, dill, and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
O blind Persian! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate. Then the outside will be clean too.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
The same thing with you. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And they say, "If we had been living in the times of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets."
This is how you testify against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the sins that those who lived before you started!
O nest of venomous snakes! How can you escape punishment in the Fire?
So I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. So that you may kill some of them, crucify some, and whip others in your temples. And chase them from town to town.
"That you may be rewarded with the blood of the righteous people who have been slain on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this is going to happen to the people who are still alive.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. Many times I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would not let me!
Look, your house is empty.
We say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus walked out of the temple. As he was walking, his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" said Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. The disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Be watchful! Take care that you are not deceived.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many people.
You hear about wars. You also hear people talking about upcoming wars. Don't be afraid. These things have to happen. But the end is not here yet.
The nation will fight the nation. Royalty will fight royalty. People will starve. There will be earthquakes in many places.
These are all the early signs of labor.
Then people will hand you over to be dealt with, and they will kill you. All the nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people turned away from their faith. They came to hate each other. They handed each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. To deceive many people.
"Fear of evil increases it, love of most people cools it."
But only those who endure to the end will be saved.
The good news of the kingdom is to be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof goes down to their house to get something out.
No one in the field went back to get their coat.
How difficult these days are for pregnant women! How difficult they are for nursing mothers!
I hope you won't have to flee in winter or on a Saturday.
It will be a great suffering in these days. It will be worse than anything that has happened since the beginning of the world until now. And it will never happen like that again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! There is Christ!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
So that false Christians and false prophets may appear. So that they may perform signs and great miracles. So that they may try to deceive God's chosen people, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "He's far out in the desert," don't go immediately. Or if someone says, "He's submerged inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west. So will the Son of Man appear.
Wherever there is a dead carcass, the vultures will gather.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the peoples of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches start to soften and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
When you see all these things happening, you know the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I'm about to tell you is true. People who were living at that time certainly didn't die until all these things happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Consider how Noah was. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know anything about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men were in the field. One was taken and the other left.
Two women to grind with the hand mill. One to hold and the other to turn.
So keep your eyes open. You don't know on which day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew what time of night the thief was going to come. Then he would have been watching. He wouldn't have let his house be robbed.
You also must be ready. For the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Assume that the master appoints one of his slaves in charge of the rest of the slaves in his house. This slave's duty is to feed them at the proper time. The master loves a faithful and wise slave for this job.
It would be better for the servant if he found his master and served in his service when the master returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The master will leave this servant in charge of everything he owns.
Let's assume that this slave is evil. He says to himself, "My master is absent for a long time."
Suppose he starts beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with people who drink a lot.
The master of the slave will return on a day the slave does not expect. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then the gentleman is going to cut it up. He's going to send it to the place where the protesters go. People are going to cry and gnash their teeth.
The Story of Ten Bridesmaids
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were naive. Five were wise.
Stupidity took their lamp, but they didn't take olive oil with them.
The wise took oil in their jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. Because of this, all the bridesmaids got tired and sleepy.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted, "Here comes the groom! Come out to greet him!"
Then all the brides woke up and prepared their lamp.
The fools said to the wise men, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for yourself."
So they went to buy oil. But as they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The young women who were present went in with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was locked.
Afterwards, the other brides came too. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I'm telling you is true. I don't know you."
So stay alert. You don't know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The story of three servants.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who decided to go on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 went right away and put his money to work. He made an additional $10,000.
He who has $4000 earns $4000 more.
As for the man who received $2000, he walked away and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the second $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I made an extra $10,000."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man who had an extra $4000 came back. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I made an extra $4000."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who received $2000. He said, "My lord, I knew you were a harsh man, harvesting where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is yours.
His wife replied, "You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow? You knew that I gather where I did not scatter seed?
Yes, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have withdrawn it with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, "Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
Everyone has more to give. So that they have more than necessary. What about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have it taken from them.
"Get rid of the worthless servant outside. He goes into the darkness, where people will be weeping and gnashing their teeth." 'The Sheep and the Goats'
The Son of Man is going to come in his glory with all his angels. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
That all the nations may be gathered before Him. That He may separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will speak to those on his right, saying, "Father has blessed you. Come and take what is yours. This kingdom has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed things. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in jail. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you in? When did we see you in need of things and give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?
The king replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
You were strange. You didn't even call me in. I needed clothes. You didn't give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you didn't take care of me.
And they will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?"
To respond, "What I'm about to tell you is true. Anything you haven't done for one of the least important of these, you haven't done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus continued to say all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"Not during the feast," they said. "There might be trouble. A woman poured perfume on Jesus."
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on his head as he was seated at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said, "Why this talk?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always find the poor with you. But you won't always find me with you.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I'm about to tell you is true. What he did will be told everywhere this joyful news is preached in the whole world. It will be told in his memory." Judas agrees to hand Jesus over.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go to the town to a certain man. Say to him, 'The teacher says, "My time is near. We will celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples."' "
The disciples did what Jesus told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me and hand me over to my enemies."
The pupils looked very sad. One after another, they began to say, "It wasn't me, sir, was it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand in the dish with me will betray me.
The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.
Judas was the one who would betray him. He said, "Not me, Rabbi, right?" Jesus answered, "Yes, you."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then take the cup. Thank them and hand it to them. He said, "You all drink from it.
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
How about this: I'll never drink with you again, until that day when we drink together in the kingdom of our Father.
After that they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, all of you will fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after we rise from the dead, we will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone can distance themselves because of you. But I will never distance myself."
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never say that I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell, his face to the ground. He cried, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet, not my will, but yours be done."
He returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. That's how you won't make mistakes when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus walked again. He prayed, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't open their eyes.
So he left them and walked away again. For the third time he called out the same thing.
He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. "Are you still sleeping and resting?" he asked them. "Look, the hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners.
"Come on! Let's go! Who's going to take care of me now?" Jesus is arrested.
As Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. He was accompanied by a large crowd carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, arranged a signal with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the man. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions pulled out his sword. He came forward and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "All who take the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask Dad to help me? He can send an army of over 70,000 kings right away.
But how are the scriptures fulfilled? They say it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading an armed band against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"All this has happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not at all, he followed Peter Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. They were determined to kill him.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of my Lord. I will rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes, just as you said," Jesus answered. "I tell you the truth, in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy with your own ears!"
"What's your opinion?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Some slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
In front of everyone, Peter said it wasn't him. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that led to the courtyard. Another woman saw him. She told the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't him. And with an oath he said, "I don't know the man!"
After a while, the people standing there went to Peter. They said to him, "You must be one of them. The way you speak gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear. He swore and said to them, "I do not know this man!" Suddenly a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt great shame and remorse for what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I convicted an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the coins into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The high priests took the money. They said, "It is against the law for us to put this money in the temple treasury. This is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy land for the poor to be buried in. People from other countries will come to be buried there.
Why is it still called the Field of Blood today?
Then the words which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken were fulfilled. He had said, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
"They paid the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus stood before Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought him up, he answered nothing.
Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose the person they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
To gain favor with the crowd, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew why they had handed Jesus over to him.
As Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Have nothing to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered greatly in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which one of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
Pilate asked, "What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and with a crowd gathering, he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
Answer everyone, "We and our children will accept the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers led Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him of his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted the thorns together to make a crown. They put it on his head. They gave him a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him. "We honor you, King of the Jews!" they said.
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put on him a purple robe. They returned his clothes to him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter herbs and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them and cast lots for his garment.
They sat and watched him go.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, teachers of the law and elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in the Lord. The Lord will save him right now if he wishes. It is he who said, "I am the Son of the Lord."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the people standing there heard Jesus call. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
At the same time, one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Let him be. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain tore from top to bottom. The earth shook. Rocks cracked.
The leaves blossomed. The bodies of many parents who had died came back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus rose from the dead, they went to the holy city. They appeared to many people.
The Roman leader and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were very afraid. They said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not a few women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there too. As was the mother of Zebed's sons. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph, take the body and wrap it in clean linen.
He laid it in his new grave which he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
"Give the order to seal the tomb until the third day. If you don't do this, his disciples might come and steal the body, and then they will go and tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. That last lie will be worse than the first one."
"Take a few guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and leaving the guard on duty.
Jesus rises from the dead.
It was now Saturday evening. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He's not here! He's gone, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was sleeping.
Walk quickly! Tell your students, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there.' I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, yet filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, they met Jesus. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, grabbed his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards went and told the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went to the city. They told the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'
If the governor hears about this report, we'll pay him off. That's how you stay out of trouble.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The last commands of Jesus to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw it, they worshiped it. But there are still those who are in doubt.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
You must go and teach the pupils of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so came John, baptizing people in the wilderness. He also preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins, and then the Lord would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem went out as well. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
"After me comes one who is mightier than I, so that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up from the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opening. He saw the Holy Spirit coming down on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
At that time, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God's kingdom.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. I will make you fishers of men.
At once they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he was walking, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
At once he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. And he said to the unclean spirit, "Come out of the man."
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, not as their scribes.
At that moment, a man in their temple cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with such great authority! Even the evil spirits obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They went straight to the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
Simon's mother was in bed. She had a fever. They called Jesus for her.
Help her. Hold her hands and help her stand up. The heat affected her. Then she started working on them.
In that evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered in front of the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus went out to a solitary place to pray.
It was still very early in the morning, and it was dark. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He walked to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I need to preach there too, for that is why I came."
So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he begged Jesus, saying, "If you choose to cleanse me, you can."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing. Be cleansed!"
At the time, the disease left him. He recovered.
Jesus immediately dismissed him. He gave the man a strong warning.
"Don't say that to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices required by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
As for the man, he went out and began to proclaim it far and wide. He spread the news to everyone. Therefore, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He would stay in secluded places outside. But people still came to Him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of his return spread throughout the house.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no room left, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man down on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the religious teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! I hope God can forgive sins!
At that moment, Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things?"
Is it easier to say to the man, "Your sins are forgiven," than to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"Truly I tell you, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
"I say to you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go back to your house."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away, and the people were all amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
Again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
As he went, Jesus saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he said to him. And he got up, left everything, and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with Him and His disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some Pharisee teachers of the law. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." They asked Jesus about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees fast often. People came to Jesus and said, "John's disciples fast often, and the Pharisees' disciples fast often, but yours do not. Why don't they fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But when the time comes and the groom takes them, on that day they will leave without eating.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing such a thing?"
Answer, "Have you never read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
At that time, Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
The Son of Man is Lord, even on the Sabbath day.
Healing on Saturday
Once again Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man there who had a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as new.
Afterward the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This was to prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. So those who were sick pushed toward Him to touch Him.
When the people who had evil spirits in them saw him, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve messengers.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called certain people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They had authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them, and Jesus gave him the name Peter.
They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
They were brothers Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. They were also brothers Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and His disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. They went to take care of him. They said, "He's crazy."
Some of the scribes were there. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus called them and began to speak to them in parables. He said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
If a kingdom is at war with itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
