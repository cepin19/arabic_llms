Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued with Shealtiel, who was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Uzziah.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaath. Achimaath was the father of Ahimaaz.
Eliezer was the father of Eliezr. Eliezr was the father of Matan. Matan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her publicly. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had said would happen. He had said it through the prophet,
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the wise men secretly, and learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. Finally, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose during the night, and departed into Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was very angry. He issued orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the boys two years old and under had to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was king in Judea in the place of his father Herod. That made Joseph afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he went to the land of Galilee instead.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! For the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people came out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and from the whole region of the Jordan.
When they confessed that they had sinned, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruits that show you have turned away from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"His spear is in his hand to clear the chaff from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire." Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted John to baptize him.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you fall down and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was located beside the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The territories east of the Jordan River!
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets and followed him immediately.
Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And he called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who are spiritually poor, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who do not carry pride, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you because of me. Blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people have persecuted prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good works you do. And they will glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter or stroke of the law passes away. And not the smallest letter or stroke of the law will pass away until all things are accomplished.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I say to you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. It was said, “Do not murder.” (Exodus 20:13) Whoever murders will be subject to judgment.
But this I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Suppose you are presenting your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are with him on the way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand should lead you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is but a single part of your body. Better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell.
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord, and do not make vows to him that you cannot keep."
But this I say to you, make no such vows at all. Make no vows by heaven, for it is the throne of God.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. That is the seat of God's feet. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything more is from the evil one. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
Suppose someone sues you to take your shirt. Let him take your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Refuse not him who would borrow of you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.'
But this is what I say to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"So you shall be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even tax collectors do the same.
"And if you only greet those related to you, what is your excellence over others? Is it not the believers in Allah who are more deserving of greeting those who have believed? And Allah is Knowing of what you do."
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to those in need.
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who claim to be holy. They proclaim what they do in the temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am telling you is true. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
"Then your supplication will be answered in secret, and your father will turn to you in secret, while they are praying."
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your unseen Father. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, do not babble repetitively like the hypocrites do. They think they will be heard because of their many words.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Save us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Deliver us from evil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. - Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
When you fast, do not look gloomy like those who pretend to be pious. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I am telling you is true. They have received their reward in full.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then no one will know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who is unseen, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and hate the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothes.
But that is what I am saying to you: Even Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these flowers.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who do not fear God run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
You see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you pay no attention to the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get the splinter out of your eye," when you've got a splinter in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.
To all who ask, it shall be given. To him who seeks, it shall be found. To him who knocks, the door shall be opened.
"If your son asks for bread, who among you would give him a stone?"
Or what if he asked for a fish? Which one of you would give him a snake?
"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
In all things, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The wide gate and broad way lead to destruction and hell. Many people go that way.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell their true nature by their actions. Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" Wise and foolish builders.
So everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain comes. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not do them is like a foolish man. He builds his house on the sand.
The rain comes. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. And it falls with a loud noise.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
He said, "O Lord, my servant is lying in the house, unable to move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But speak the word only, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the crowd around him, and he told his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
So Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are about to drown!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and they ceased. There was a dead calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man, that even the winds and waves obey him?" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was grazing.
The demons pleaded with Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and they drowned in the water.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone everything, and what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into the boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his town.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the man who couldn't walk, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for giving such authority to human beings. Jesus chose when
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast, so why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will tear away from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
"People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying this, a ruler came up, knelt down before Jesus, and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live again."
Jesus got up and went with him, as did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a disease that made her bleed. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought, "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said, "Dear woman, do not lose hope. Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus was passing by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your belief will guide you.
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was unable to speak.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Only a few workers are needed.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
The next are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. There are two others, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve with the following instructions. He said, "Do not go to those who are not Jews." "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
Do not take with you gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If that house welcomes you, grant it a blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah will be easier than that of this city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you.
You will not be the speaker. It is the spirit of your father that will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what can those who live there expect?
Do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is secret will be revealed. Everything that is hidden will be brought to light.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
He's counting every hair on your head!
So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
"A man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if anyone loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Assume that a person welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And assume that a person welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person. That person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
Suppose someone gave a glass of cold water to a child who follows me. What I am about to tell you is true. That person will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he continued teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see.
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
It is he who was written about in the Holy Book. It says: "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one born of woman is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is Elijah who was to come.
"Whoever has ears, let them hear."
By what can I compare the people of today? They are like children sitting in the markets, calling out to others. They say,
We played the flute for you. But you did not dance. We sang a funeral hymn. But you did not mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He is possessed by a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which were performed in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent. He said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be judged less harshly than you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
The father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to make him known.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my disciples and learn from me. I am meek and free from pride. You will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through fields of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck and eat some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the Law? It tells how the priests in the Temple are to perform their duties every Sabbath day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
I say to you, something more important than the temple is here.
The writings say, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
He left that place and entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and distorted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is above the sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, how they might destroy him. The servant of the chosen God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be made new.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not quench a flickering flame. He will make everything alright.
"The peoples will hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed the man. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If a devil drives out a devil, he is fighting himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take what he has by himself? You must first bind him. Then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So here is what I say to you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. That person will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come.
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O den of vipers! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts.
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him. A bad man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment, people will give account for every careless word they speak.
"By your words you will be justified, or by your words you will be condemned." - St. Augustine
Some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus, saying, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
He replied, "Evil and unfaithful people demand a miraculous sign! But the only sign that will be given is the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Greece was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something similar will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a human? It passes through dry lands in search of a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." And when he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other evil spirits more wicked than itself. They enter and make a home there, and the man's final state is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation." Jesus' mother and brothers arrived.
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people on the shore stood up.
Then he told them many things through stories, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Some seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and the plants were choked.
And other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"Whoever has ears, let them hear."
The disciples came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
Everyone who has that kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, he will have abundance. But he who does not have that kind of knowledge, even the little he has will be taken from him.
Here's the reason I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. You will surely see, but you will not perceive."
"Their hearts are calloused. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, lest they hear with their ears, lest they understand with their hearts, lest they turn to the Lord and He heal them." (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am going to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
But those who received the seed on rocky ground are the ones who hear the word and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when difficulties or suffering come because of the message.
As for the seeds that fell among the thorns, these are the ones who hear the word, but the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did this." The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and weed it out?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're pulling the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the reapers to gather the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned, then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn." Parables of the Mustard Seed and Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it becomes the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said, "which a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked its way through the whole batch."
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds using parables. He did not say anything to them without a parable.
So the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from of old. I will tell of things hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. So it will be at the end of the age.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will cast them into the burning furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let anyone with ears listen. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very precious. So he went and sold all he had. And bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled the net onto the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be cast into the fiery furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus asked, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure new things and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where does this man get this wisdom? And what is this power that he can do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives and in his own home."
He only did a few miracles there because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. He was greatly pleased.
So he promised her by an oath that he would give her all that she asked.
Her mother told her what to say. And the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. But he remembered his promise and his dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
They said, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5,000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the multitude away.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from shore. The waves were crashing against it violently because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. They said, "It's a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
Peter said, "Lord, are you?" He said to him, "If it is I, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. Crying out, he said, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. They sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to let the sick people touch even the edge of his cloak. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God, but prefer to follow your own teachings?"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
Oh protesters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." What comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Jesus asked them, "Do you not yet understand?"
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you 'unclean'. But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you 'unclean'. "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus did not say a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away. She keeps shouting after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. She said, "Oh Lord! Help me!"
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus left that place. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
A large crowd gathered around him. They brought to him the blind and those who could not walk. They also brought the crippled, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. Those who were paralyzed were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." "How far shall we go and buy enough bread to feed this great multitude?" they asked.
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples then gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign as a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign, a miracle from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about it among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is so small! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves of the four thousand? Do you not remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "Impossible, Lord! This will never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory, and his angels with him. And then he will reward each one according to what they have done.
What I am about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus changed.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the pupils heard this, they were terrified. They fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. He said, "Don't tell anyone what you saw. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "That is true. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again.
But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him on his knees.
He said, "Oh Lord, have mercy on my son. He shivers greatly and suffers much. Often he falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
Jesus said, "You hypocritical and evil people! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to people."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise again." The disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect them from their sons or from others?"
"I am," Peter replied. Jesus said to him, "Then the children are exempt."
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the small coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.
