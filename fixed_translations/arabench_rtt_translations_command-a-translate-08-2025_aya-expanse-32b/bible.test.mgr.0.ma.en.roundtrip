At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and asked the child to stand among them.
Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Anyone who becomes as humble as this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever welcomes one such little child in my name, welcomes me."
"But what if someone were to cause one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? It would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
"How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to those who cause them!
"If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven.

"What do you think? Imagine someone has a hundred sheep, and one of them is lost. Won't he leave the ninety-nine sheep on the mountain and go look for the lost sheep?"
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds this ram, he will be happier about it than about 99 other rams that were not lost.
This is how your Father in heaven is. He does not want to lose any of these little ones. When someone does you wrong
"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back."
"But what if he won't listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The Bible says, 'On the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established' (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I'm telling you now is true. What you close on earth will remain closed in heaven. And what you open on earth will remain open in heaven.
"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." The servant who had no mercy.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants about all that was owed to him.
And when the king began to do so, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, and children, along with all that he had, were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him. "Give me some time," he pleaded, "I will repay you everything."
So his master had compassion on him, forgave him the debt, and let him go.
But that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
And the other servant fell on his knees and begged him, "Give me time, and I will repay you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
He saw the other servants who had fallen. This made them very afraid. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the master called the first servant and said to him, “Wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have mercy on the other servant as I had mercy on you?
His master was angry and handed him over to the jailers. He would have been punished until he paid back everything he owed.
"So will my Father in heaven do to every one of you, unless you forgive your brother from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
And when Jesus had finished speaking, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
And some Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator 'made them male and female' from the beginning?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Then why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. And a man is not to divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Others have been made that way by other people. Still others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Little children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why are you asking me about what is good?" answered Jesus. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, you must obey the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all these commandments. What else should I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When this young man heard this talk, he went away sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And I say to you again: It is difficult for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. But it is even harder for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "Is there anyone who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who follow me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Whoever leaves home or family or fields for me will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out again around 9 a.m. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
So they went. Then he went out again around noon, and the third time after noon, and did the same thing.
He left around five o'clock and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why were you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
“When evening came, he spoke with the man in charge of the vineyard workers. He said to him, ‘Call the workers and give them their pay. Start with the last ones hired, and then give it to the first.’”
The workers who start at around 5 o'clock came. Each one received the wage for a regular day.
And so, when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
As soon as they received it, they started complaining about its owner.
They said, "Those people who were recently hired only worked for one hour. I paid them the same amount I paid you. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Keep your money and walk. I wanted to pay the people I recently hired the same wage I used to pay you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Do you feel cheated because you gave a lot to other people?
"So, those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Jesus speaks again about his upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We will go to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death.
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. People will mock him and beat him and nail him to a cross. And on the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The woman, who was not from the children of Zabad, came to Jesus. Her children were with her. She stood by His feet and asked Him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that my two sons may sit, one on your right and one on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They answered him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. But whoever among you wants to be great must be your servant.
And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like a human being. He didn't come to be served, but to serve others. He gave his life to sacrifice it and free many people from slavery." Two blind men became seeing.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd commanded them to stop. They begged them to be quiet. But the two men cried out even louder: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, and asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They answered, "Lord, we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
And when they came near Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone asks you for anything, tell them that the Lord needs it. The Owner will send it back to you immediately.
This happened so that the words spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. They say:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and its foal. They put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd spread out and placed their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and scattered them across the path.
Some people walked in front of him, and others followed. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. People asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Go to Jesus at the place where the blind and disabled are. And bring them there.
And the chief priests and the scribes saw the miracles that he did, and they saw the children who were crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" asked Solomon. Jesus replied, "Yes. Have you never read this in the Scriptures? 'You have taught children and infants to give you praise'" (Psalm 8:2).
Then Jesus left the crowd and went away from the town to Bethany, where he spent the night. Cursing the Fig Tree
Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem early in the morning. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And at that moment the tree withered.
When the pupils saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Questioning Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will also ask you one question. If you tell Me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or was it from men?" They argued with each other about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The story of the two sons.
"What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first one and said, 'My son, go work today in the vineyard.'"
"I won't do that," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. He answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed in him. You saw this, yet you did not repent and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another parable. There was a man who owned a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, dug a winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased the vineyard to some farmers and traveled to a distant country.
So when the time of harvest came, he sent his servants to the tenants, and ordered them to gather his share of the produce.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
And after that, the man sent other servants to the vine-growers. He sent more than the first time. The vine-growers treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir to the owner's property. Let's kill him, and the property will be ours."
So they seized him, drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the car returns, what will he do to this driver?
"He will destroy those wicked men," they answered. "Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23).
"Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit."
Anyone who falls on that rock will be dashed to pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowds. For the people held Jesus to be a prophet.
Wedding Feast Story
And Jesus continued to tell them other stories. He said:
"What is the kingdom of heaven like? It is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. He asked the servants to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
As for the rest, they captured his servants. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
"Then the king said to his servants, 'The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come.'"
Walk down the street. Call out to everyone you meet.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad. And soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding attire.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted how they might entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to one's status.
So tell us, what is your opinion? Should we pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus was aware of their evil plans and said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay their taxes. He brought him silver coins.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished. They left him and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On that day, the Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that i
"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children to carry on his brother's name.
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and then died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. This continued until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
"So when the dead rise, whose wife will I be? They all seven were married to me."
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
When the dead come back to life, they don't get married. Their parents don't give them money to get married. They will be like angels in heaven.
"Isn't there any resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what Allah has told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
He said to him, "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is this: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." Whose Son is the Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
And he said unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"So if David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him even with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So you must obey them. Do everything they ask of you. But don't do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves don't even want to move a finger to carry them.
All they do is for others to see. They put small boxes containing verses from the Bible on their foreheads and arms. They make these boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.
"They sit in the places of honor at the top table. They ensure they have the most important places in the assembly."
They like to be acknowledged in the markets. They like it when people call them "Rabbi".
"But do not call anyone 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called "teacher." You have only one teacher, and it is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

Signs of the End of the World
Jesus went out from the temple. As he was going away, his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. And the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being led astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
"You'll hear about wars. You'll hear people talking about the wars that will come in the future. Don't be afraid. This has to happen. But the end is not here yet."
Nations will rise up against nations, and kingdoms against kingdoms. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
"Then people will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and all nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their religion. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
There will appear many false prophets. They will deceive many people.
Since evil will increase, the love of most people will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that causes desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) In time, you will see it standing in the holy place. Let the reader understand.

Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's assume that a master appointed one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to give them their food at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this purpose.
If the master returns and finds his servant doing his job, it will be good for the servant.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The master will give this servant responsibility over everything he has.
But let's suppose that servant is evil. Let's suppose he says to himself, 'My master will be away for a long time.'
Suppose he started beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of this servant will return on a day when the servant does not expect him. He will return at a time when the servant does not know.
And then they will cut the man into pieces. They will send him to the place where liars go. And there people will cry and gnash their teeth.
"The Tale of Ten Maids of Honor"
"How will the kingdom of heaven be at that time? The ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five of them were wise.
Fools took their lanterns with them, but they didn't take olive oil.
The wise took the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. That's why the women who were helping the bride got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!
Then all the bride's maids awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
"No," they answered. "There may not be enough for us all. Go instead to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
"They went to buy oil. But on their way, the groom arrived. The women who were present went in with him to the wedding dinner. And the door was closed."
Then the other bridesmaids also came. And they said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
"Therefore be alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The parable of the three servants"
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he continued on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and invested his money. He made an additional $10,000.
He who gets $4000, gets $4000 more.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground, hid his master's money in it, and then buried it.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who was given $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me and gave me $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
"Come on, even the man who had $4000. He said, 'Sir, you have become my trusted one and gave me $4000. Look, I made another $4000.'"
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who had received two thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
And so I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is what comes back to you.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow? Did you know that I gather crops where I did not scatter seed?
So, you should have put my money in the bank. And when I returned, I would have gotten it back with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, 'Take the thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand.'
Anyone who has something will take more. They will have more than they need. What about those who have nothing? Even what they have will be taken from them.
They drove that useless servant out into the darkness, where people will weep and gnash their teeth. Sheep and goats.
"The Son of Man came with all his glory, and all the angels were with him. And he will sit on his throne of glory in heaven."
All nations will be gathered before Him. And the people will be separated into two groups, like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will drive the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then those who did good deeds will answer, saying: "Our Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You? Or thirsty and give You drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and bring you in? When did we see you in need of things and give them to you?
"When have we seen you sick or in prison and not gone to visit you?"
The king will answer: 'What I am about to tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of my least important brothers, you have done for me.'
"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me. I was in need of clothes, and you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison, but you did not take care of me.
And they also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger, or needing clothes, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?'
He will say: "This is what I will tell you is true. Everything you have not done for one of these who have no value, you have not done it for me."
"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done good will receive eternal life."
The plan to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus, carrying a beautifully sealed flask filled with very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume over his head as he sat at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. They said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always have kind people with you. But I will not always be with you.
She sprayed perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What was done will be repeated wherever this good news spreads throughout the world. It will be repeated so that it is remembered. Judas agreed to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
And he asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time Judas sought opportunity to betray him unto them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
And so the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; they prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were very sorrowful. They began to say to him, one by one, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
"Nevertheless, the Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who betrayed him. He said, "I am not the one, am I, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, praised Allah, and passed it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I tell you: From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said Peter would fail.
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter answered, "Everyone may forsake you, but I will never do so."
Jesus answered, "Verily I say unto thee, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you, but I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
And Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here until I go over there and pray."
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell face first to the ground. He prayed and said, "Father, if possible, let this cup of suffering pass from me. Yet, let your will be done, not mine."
Then he returned to his disciples, whom he found sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Watch and pray. That's how you won't fall into sin when you're tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus walked away again. He prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. But if I must drink it, may your will be done."
He returned later. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he prayed the same prayer.
Then he came back to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! Here comes the one who will hand me over to them!" Jesus was arrested.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived, one of the Twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who had resolved to betray Jesus, had given them a signal: "The man I shall kiss is the one; seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
"Do you think I can't ask for help from Dad? He'll send an army of over 70,000 angels right away."
But how will the prophecies mentioned in the sacred books be fulfilled then? They say that this must happen in this way.
At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, "Did I come out against you with a band of armed men?" And he asked them, "Was it necessary for you to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened so that the prophecies of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Sanhedrin
And those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed Jesus at a distance, not far away. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin were looking for evidence they could use against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward to testify. Finally, two other witnesses came forward to give their testimony.
They said: "This man said: 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
And then the high priest stood up. He addressed Jesus: "Will you not answer? What are these charges that these men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all: In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
And after that, the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You heard him say these evil words."
"What are you saying?" "He needs to die!" he replied.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't so. And he swore, saying, "I do not know this man!"
A little later, those who stood there approached Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
And immediately Peter began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know this man." And the rooster crowed.
Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times and say that you do not know me." And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that they had sentenced Him to death. He felt ashamed and deeply regretted his actions. So, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I have sinned," he said. "I have delivered an innocent man." "What's it to us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
And so, Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests collected the money. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for this is blood money, the price of a man's life."
So they decided to use the money to buy a piece of land to bury the pottery. People from other countries would be buried there.
And that is why it is still called the Field of Blood to this day.
And so were fulfilled the words that the prophet Jeremiah had spoken: "They gave me thirty pieces of silver, the price that the sons of Israel had set for him."
"They paid the equivalent of thirty pieces of silver for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me" (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9). They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
And then Pilate said: Don't you hear the charges they are making against you?
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whoever they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
Now while Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message: "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two men do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What, then, shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and that they were becoming agitated. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
All the people answered: "I and my children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but ordered Jesus to be flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. And the whole company of soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a purple robe.
And after that they took up thorns and made a crown of them, and put it on his head. And they put a reed in his right hand. And they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they mocked him, they took away his robe. They dressed him in his own clothes. Then they led him away to crucify him. They crucified Jesus on the cross.
And when they had gone out of the city, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross.
And they came to a place called Golgotha. And the word Golgotha means "place of the skull."
And there they mixed wine with bitter herbs and offered it to Jesus to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat there and kept watching him.
They put a sign over his head that read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
The people who passed by him started talking about Jesus and laughing at him. They shook their heads.
And they said, "Are you the one who is going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
The chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him also.
And they said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
He believes in God. Let God save him now if he wants him. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three o'clock, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Jesus cried out in a loud voice around the ninth hour, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
And some of the bystanders, hearing Jesus cry out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
So one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The tombs were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to a great many people.
The Roman commander and the guards who were watching over Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and said, "This man was definitely the Son of God!"
A large number of women were watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. There was also Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
And when the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself had been Jesus' disciple.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And he laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. And the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So give the order to secure the tomb until the third day, otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body, and then tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead, and this last lie will be worse than the first.
Pilate answered, "Take a guard. Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other went to see the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He's not here! He left just as he said he would! Come and see the spot where he was sleeping.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is my message for you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
And suddenly Jesus appeared to them and said, "Peace be with you!" Then they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
And as the women were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and told the chief priests all that had happened.
When the high priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears about this report, we'll pay him a bribe. That will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. These were the last instructions Jesus gave to his disciples.
And after that, the disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated before him, but some of them were doubtful.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths'" (Isaiah 40:3).
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also preached to the people that they should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people of the Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. When they acknowledged their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." - The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
He heard a voice from the sky. It said to him, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
And immediately the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days, and the devil tested him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus, and angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee. He began preaching the good news from God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went off to follow Jesus. And Jesus drove out a demon that was mute.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one having authority, not as the scribes.
Then a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a shout.
All the people were amazed, and they said to each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands evil spirits and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue and went immediately with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.
All the city's inhabitants gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness had not yet lifted. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Healing of a Man with Leprosy by Jesus
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down on his knees, and begged him, saying, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be 'clean'!"
The disease left him immediately. He has recovered.
Jesus sent him away immediately. He gave the man a severe warning.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this. Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be evidence for the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in secluded places, but people from all quarters continued to gather around him.
Jesus heals a man who was unable to walk.
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. And the people heard that He had come back to the house.
A large crowd gathered, so large that there was no more room. There was not even room outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting down their mat, they lowered the man.
Jesus saw their faith. And he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
"Why is this man talking like that? He's saying something really bad! Only God can forgive sins!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you think this?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the man who could not walk,
"I'm telling you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched him. And all the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great multitude came to him, and he taught them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the house of Levi, and many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with him and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." A question was presented to Jesus about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast. Why do they notHerHerHerHerHe
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
"People don't sew a new patch on old clothes. If they do this, the new patch will pull the old one, and this will make the hole bigger."
"They don't put new wine in old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they put new wine in new wineskins." Jesus is Lordâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâceâc
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain as they made their way.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
It was at the time when Abiathar was high priest that David entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it, but David also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
And Jesus went again into the synagogue; and there was a man there whose hand was withered.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man who had a withered and twisted hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
And after that, Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was deeply disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored, as sound as the other.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus walked with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and great crowds from Galilee followed them.
When the people heard all that Jesus was doing, many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This way, he could avoid being pressed by the people.
Jesus had healed many people. So the sick were jostling to touch him.
And the people who had evil spirits in them fell down before him. And the cries of the spirits: "This is the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
And he chose twelve of them and called them apostles. And they were with him. He also sent them out to preach.
They would have the power to cast out demons.
And Jesus chose the twelve disciples. Simon was one of them. And Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were James son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus called them Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests and offered to betray Jesus to them for thirty pieces of silver.
Jesus entered a house. Again, a large crowd gathered. The crowd was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it, so they came to take him under their care. They said, "He is out of his mind."
There were some teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem and said, "By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons!"
So Jesus called them and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom is fighting itself, it won't be able to stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
