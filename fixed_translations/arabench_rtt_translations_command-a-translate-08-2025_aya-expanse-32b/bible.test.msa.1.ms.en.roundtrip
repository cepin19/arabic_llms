environmentalist Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and asked the child to stand among them.
Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever welcomes one such little child in my name, welcomes me."
"But what if one of these little ones who believe in me is led into sin? If that happens, it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea."
"What terrible tribulation will come upon the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come. But woe to those who cause them!"
"If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire in Hell with two hands and two feet."
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
Translate
"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that is lost?"
What I am about to tell you is true. If he finds that one sheep, he is more joyful about it than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
The same applies to your Father in heaven. He doesn't want to lose any of these little ones. When someone does you wrong
"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back."
"But what if he won't listen to you? Then take one or two others along with you. The Bible says, 'On the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established' (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him no longer as a brother. Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am telling you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Again, I tell you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to get all the money his servants owed him.
And as the king began to do this, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. Therefore, his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all that he owned were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him, and pleaded: "Give me some time, I will return everything."
His master had compassion on him, forgave him the debt, and let him go.
But that servant went out and found another servant who owed him a few dollars, and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
And the other servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
But the first servant refused, and instead went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what had happened. They were very disturbed by it. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the master called the first servant and said to him, "Wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Shouldn't you have mercy on the other servant as I had mercy on you?
So his master, angry, handed him over to the jailers until he should pay back all he owed.
"So will my heavenly Father do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him, and there he healed them.
And some Pharisees came to him, testing him, and said, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that the Creator 'made them male and female in the beginning'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.
And they asked, "Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered them, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but from the beginning it was not so.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. And a man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone is able to accept the idea of remaining single; only those to whom it is given to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Others have been made that way by other people. Still others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. And anyone who can accept living this way should do so." Little children were brought to Jesus.
And some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
So the man asked, "Which ones?" Jesus replied, "Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony.
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all these commandments. What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And I say to you again: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who follow me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out again around 9 a.m. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
And he said to them, "Go, you also, into my vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
So they went away. Then he went out again at noon and at three in the afternoon and did the same thing.
He left around five o'clock and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and going to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received the usual daily wage.
So when those who had worked the whole day came, they thought they would receive more pay. But each one of them also received a day's pay.
And when they received it, they started complaining about its owner.
They said: "These people who were recently hired only worked for one hour. You paid them the same amount you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to pay the people I recently hired the same wage I paid you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I've been generous to others?
"But many who are last will be first, and the first last." Jesus speaks again about His upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. He will be mocked and beaten and crucified on a wooden cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus with her sons. Falling at his feet, she asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked her. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
Then Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The ten other disciples heard of it and were indignant against the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like this, but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regained their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They asked them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They answered, "Lord, we want to be able to see."
And Jesus, deeply moved, touched their eyes. Immediately they regained their sight and followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
And when they came near Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
And he said to them, "Go into the village that is before you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The Master will send them money right away.
And this happened so that the prophecy spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. For it was said:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
So they brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on them.
Large crowds spread out and placed their coats on the road. Others cut branches from trees and scattered them across the path.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
And the multitude answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all who sold and bought there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
And he said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a den of robbers." (Jeremiah 7:11)
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the scribes saw the miracles that he did, and heard the children in the temple crying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” But when they saw it, they were indignant.
They asked him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" Jesus replied, "Yes, have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowd and went away from the town to Bethany, where he spent the night. Cursing the Fig Tree
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem early in the morning. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road, and went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Questioning Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question. If you tell me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or was it from men?" They argued with each other about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We fear people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Story of the Two Sons
"What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'"
"I won't do that," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw this, yet even after that, you did not turn from your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another parable. There was a man who owned a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, dug a winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased the vineyard to some farmers and traveled to a distant land on a journey.
And when the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, that they might gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. And they treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming, and said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'
So they took him and drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
They answered, "He will destroy those wicked men and will rent the vineyard to other vinedressers, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit."
Anyone who falls on that rock will be dashed to pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowds. For the people held Jesus to be a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
And Jesus told them another parable. He said:
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
So he sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner, saying to them, "Come, for everything is ready." But they all alike began to make excuses.
"Then he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have prepared my feast, and my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast."'
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
And the rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and then killed them.
The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come.'
Go to the corners of the street. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad. And soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding attire.
"My friend," he asked, "how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted how they might entrap Jesus in his words.
So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not care about anyone's status, because you teach the way of God honestly."
So tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
"Show me the coin that people use to pay the tax." So they brought him a silver coin.
And he asked them, "Whose is this image? And whose are these words?"
They answered, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
And when they heard this, they marveled. And they left him and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question, for they do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children for his brother so that his brother's name will not be forgotten.
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and then died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. This continued until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
So now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For they all were married to her during life, seven husbands.
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will they be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has said to you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
So he asked him, "Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." Who is the Son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He?" They answered, "The Son of David."
So he said to them, "How then does David call him 'the Spirit,' saying, 'The Spirit spoke by my mouth, and He said...'?
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"So if David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus condemned the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
Therefore, you must obey them. Do everything they ask of you. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves do not wish to move a single finger to carry them.
All they do is for others to see. They put small boxes containing Bible verses on their foreheads and arms. They make these boxes very wide. And they make the fringes on their coats very long.
They love to sit in places of honor at feasts, to be greeted with the best greetings in the marketplaces, and to have the best seats in the synagogues.
They love to be greeted in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi' by others.
"But do not call anyone 'Father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven. All of you are brothers and sisters.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher.' You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."

Signs of the End of the World
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said, "Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left standing on another; all will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. And the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Be on your guard! Let no one lead you astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be afraid. These things must happen. But the end is not yet."
One nation will fight against another nation, and one kingdom against another. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
"Then people will hand you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of me."
At that time, many will abandon their faith. They will hate one another. And they will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
Because evil will increase, the love of most people will grow cold.
But whoever endures to the end, he will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination of desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day, it will stand in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their home to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
"Woe, that Day, to the pregnant women! Woe, that Day, to those who are suckling!"
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than at any time since the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be cut short.
"At that time, someone may say to you, 'Look, the Christ is here!' or 'He is there!' Do not believe it."
False Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, the elect of God.
See? I told you so.
"For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. Behold, I have told you beforehand."
The lightning that appears in the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
"After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.'" (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
"Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and it puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near."

They did not know anything about what would happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
"There will be two men in the field, one will be taken and the other left."
Two women will be grinding at the mill together; one will be taken and the other left.
"So wait, you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would be watching. He wouldn't let his house be robbed.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's assume that a master appointed one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to provide them with their food at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant to do this.
It will be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his work when he returns.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. The master will put that servant in charge of all that he owns.
But let's suppose that this slave is evil. Let's suppose he says to himself, 'My master will be away for a long time.'
Suppose he started beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will come on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then the Lord will tear it to pieces and send it to the place where the hypocrites go. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Bridesmaids
"The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five of them were wise.
As for the foolish ones, they took their lamps but did not bring oil with them.
The wise took the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. Therefore, the bridesmaids felt tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: 'Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!'
Then all the bride's maids awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
They replied, "No, there may not be enough for all of us. Go instead to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the bridesmaids who were ready with him went into the wedding banquet. Then the door was shut.
Then the other bridesmaids came later. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
"Therefore be alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come." - Three Slaves Story
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a king, which went to travel into a far country: and he called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Someone was given $10,000. Another was given $4,000. And the third was given $2,000. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went and invested his money, earning another ten thousand dollars.
The person who was earning $4000 received an additional $4000.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who had received $10,000 brought another $10,000 with him. He said, "Master, you entrusted me with $10,000. Look, I have made another $10,000."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
And the man who had the 4000 dollars also came. He said, "Sir, you entrusted me with 4000 dollars. Look, I have made an additional 4000 dollars."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand dollars came and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
That's why I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is what comes back to you.
So his master answered him, “You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed?
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. Then, when I returned, I would have gotten it back with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take the two thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand dollars."
Whoever has will be given more. He will have more than enough. What about the person who has nothing? Even what he has will be taken from him.
"Throw that worthless servant out into the darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth." Sheep and goats
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne."
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people into two groups, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
I was hungry. You gave me food. I was thirsty. You gave me drink. I was a stranger. You welcomed me.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then those who did good deeds will answer, saying: "Our Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You? Or thirsty and give You drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? When did we see you in need of clothes and provide them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
And the King will answer them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me. I was in need of clothes, and you did not provide them. I was sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.
And they will also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you?"
"Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous will go to eternal life."
Plan to kill Jesus
After Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth, for they wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, "What a waste!"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this, and said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good deed for me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What I have done will be told everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world, in memory of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
And he asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time Judas sought opportunity to betray him unto them. The Last Supper
That day was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go into the city to So-and-so and say, 'The Teacher says, "My appointed time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house."' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
And when the evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
So the disciples were very sad, and each of them said to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
So Jesus answered, "He who has dipped his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
"The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who betrayed him. He asked, "Is it I, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, praised Allah the Most High, and passed it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is shed for the forgiveness of sins for many.
This is what I tell you: I will not drink wine with you from now on, until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said Peter would fail.
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Then Peter answered and said, "Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be stumbled."
Jesus answered, "Verily I say unto thee, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you, but I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples, and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. And again he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And he prayed a third time, the same words.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
"Rise up! Let us go! Behold, he who betrays me is at hand!" And they took Jesus.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, had agreed with them on a sign. He said, "The one I will kiss is the man; seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Friends, do what you have come to do." Then the soldiers came, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
So Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my Father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how then are the prophecies spoken of in the Holy Scriptures fulfilled? They say that this must happen in this way.
At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. He asked them, "Do I lead a band of armed men against you? Why did you bring swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened so that the prophecies of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Sanhedrin
And those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter was not far away; he followed Jesus. And he went into the courtyard of the high priest, and sat with the guards to see the end.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward to testify. Finally, two other witnesses came forward to testify.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter says he does not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But Peter said before them all that it wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't so. And he swore, saying, "I do not know this man!"
And after a little while, those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for your speech betrays you."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
So they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
And Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep regret and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver.
"I have sinned," he said. "I have delivered an innocent man." "What's it to us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Then Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. He went away and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money."
So they decided to use the money to buy a clay field. People from other countries would be buried there.
And for this reason, it is still called the Field of Blood today.
Then the words which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken were fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the sons of Israel.
"So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said to me, 'Throw it to the potter'—the handsome price at which they valued me! So
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear all these accusations that they are making against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whoever they wanted.
And at that time they had a famous prisoner called Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had delivered Jesus to him.
Now while Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message: "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
Then Pilate asked, "What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere. In fact, the crowd was becoming restless. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people answered, "I and my children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but ordered Jesus to be flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. And the whole company of soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him and hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his own clothes on him and led him away to be crucified with nails. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
And as they led him out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry his cross.
And they came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
And they mixed wine with gall and offered it to Jesus to drink. But after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them.
They sat there and kept watching him.
And they put a sign on his head with the written accusation against him, which read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
And those who passed by were shouting abusively at Jesus and making faces at him. They were shaking their heads.
And they said, "Are you the one who is going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"He has saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him."
He believes in God, so let God save him now if He wants him, for he said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
And some of the bystanders, hearing Jesus, said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
And the rest said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
And when Jesus had cried out again with a loud voice, he died.
And at that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The graves were opened, and many of the saints who had died were restored to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to his needs.
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, and Joseph of Arimathea, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
And as the evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came.
And he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud.
And he placed it in his new tomb that he had carved out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he went away.
And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting, opposite the sepulcher. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. And the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They replied, "Sir, we remember that while that liar was still alive, he said, 'In three days I will rise.'"
So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, in case his disciples came and stole his body and then told the people that he had been raised from the dead. This last deception would be worse than the first.
Then Pilate said, "Take soldiers, go, make the tomb secure, and make it as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
The resurrection of Jesus from the dead.
Now when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other went to look at the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. And the angel of the Lord descended from heaven. He went to the tomb, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
"He is not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying."
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large amount of money.
And they said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'
If the governor hears about this report, we'll pay him off. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. These were the last instructions Jesus gave to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they worshiped him. But some still doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The prophet Isaiah wrote long ago: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also preached to the people that they should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
And all the people of the land of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and they confessed their sins. And John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Testing of Jesus
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water; and, behold, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days, and the devil tested him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come and follow me, and I will make you a fisher of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
He called them immediately, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. Jesus drives out an evil spirit.
And Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach there.
The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
At that time a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
And all the people were amazed. They said to each other, "What is this? A new teaching with great authority! He even gives orders to the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
And Jesus and those with him left the synagogue and immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
In the evening, after sunset, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus, and all who were demon-possessed.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and darkness was still over the land. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
And when they found him, they said, "Everyone is looking for you!"
So Jesus answered them, "Let us go somewhere else, to the nearby villages, so that I may preach there also. For this is why I came."
So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down on his knees and begged Jesus, saying, "If you want to make me 'clean,' you are able to do so."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be 'clean'!"
The disease immediately left him. He was cured.
Jesus immediately drove him out and sternly warned him.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in secluded places, but people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus healing a man who could not walk
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even outside the door. And Jesus was preaching the word to them.
And four of those who were present carried a man who was unable to walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting down their mat, they lowered the man.
And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
"Why is this man speaking this way? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!"
Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, "Why do you think these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
"I'm telling you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man got up, took his mat, and walked away, while everyone was watching. They were all astounded, and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
And Jesus went again to the seashore of Galilee, where a large crowd gathered around Him, and He began to teach them.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Levi sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
And afterward Jesus was sitting at a table in the house of Levi. And many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. For there were many who were following Jesus.
And there were some teachers of the law among the Pharisees who saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
And Jesus heard it, and said unto them, "They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." He was asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees often fasted and did not eat. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast often, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast also. But your
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as the bridegroom is with them.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will tear away from the old one, making the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath vocab vocab
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the wheat fields with his disciples. The disciples began to pick some of the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do these things on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do this?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
It was at the time when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. And he also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath also."
Healing on Saturday
Jesus went again into the synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and withered hand. He said to him, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around at them with anger. He was deeply disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored, just like new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
When the people heard all that Jesus was doing, many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This was to prevent the people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. So the sick rushed forward to touch him.
And when the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. The appointment of the twelve apostles by Jesus.
Jesus went up the mountain and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
And they will have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus chose twelve, and Simon was one of them. He named him Peter.
There was James son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered one of the houses. Again, a large crowd gathered. The crowd was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
So his family heard of it, and came to take him away, saying, "He is out of his mind."
And there came down from Jerusalem certain of the scribes, saying, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
Then Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If the kingdom fights itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
