Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram, and Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah begat Jotham. Jotham begat Ahaz. Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jews were taken captive to Babylon.
And after him, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel was the father of Abiud. And Abiud was the father of Eliakim. And Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Eliud.
Elieud's father was Elazar. Elazar's father was Mattan. Mattan's father was Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: Mary, his mother, was engaged to Joseph. Before they lived together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Youssef was a religious man. He didn't want to expose her in front of people. So, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
A virgin will give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus. This is why: he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had spoken would be fulfilled, which he had spoken through the prophet.
"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14). The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Christ
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time when Herod was king. After his birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star when we were in the East, and we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
And Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
Reply to them: "In Bethlehem of Judea, that is what the prophet wrote, saying:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
And after that, Herod called the wise men secretly and asked them about the exact time the star had appeared.
And he sent them to the city of Bethlehem, and said to them, "Go and search carefully for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may go and worship him."
After the wise men heard the king's words, they departed. The star they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
The wise men went to the house and saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
And after the wise men were gone, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel from the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and left for Egypt during the night.
And they remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled the word spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called My son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
And when Herod realized that he had been deceived by the wise men, he became very angry. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings who were two years old and under. This was at the same time that the wise men saw the star.
And thus were fulfilled the words which the prophet Jeremiah had spoken:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
And so Joseph arose, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
Now after they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod
And he lived there in a city called Nazareth. And so were fulfilled the prophecies that were spoken by the prophets about Jesus. They said, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
At that time John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, who said: "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
People came to him from Jerusalem and all the regions of Judea, and from all the areas around the Jordan River.
And when they had confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
"You shall not say in your heart, 'It is because of our righteousness that the Lord has brought us to this land.' For it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you."
The axe is already at the roots of the trees. All the trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, and call you to turn away from your sins. After me will come one who is stronger than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
He has the fork in his hand to clean the chaff from his threshing floor. To gather his wheat into the barn. But to burn the husks on the fire that never goes out. Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
And after Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is being tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, and there he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
And the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God'" (Deuteronomy 8:3).
And then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalms 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
And the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you prostrate and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
And after that, the devil left Jesus. The angels came and took care of him. Jesus began to preach.
John was in prison. And when Jesus heard this, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphali.
And thus was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said:
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where people who are not Jews live! The land on the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. For those living in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And immediately, they left their nets and followed him.
And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them.
And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from great pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed each one of them.
Large crowds followed him. There were people from Galilee, from the region called the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who are spiritually poor. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Congratulations to those who have passed away. May God have mercy on them.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Congratulations to you when people laugh at you and harm you because of me. And congratulations to you as well when people invent all kinds of evil lies about you because of me."
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in heaven is great. People did the same thing and harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot.
"You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden."
A candle, people don't light it and put it under a plate. But they put it on its holder. That way, it lights up everything in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. That way, they will see the good works you do. And they will glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the whole meaning to the law.
"I did not come to abolish what is written in the scriptures or in the words of the prophets. I did not come to do that. But I came to give full meaning to what is written."
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest point of the law disappears. Not even the smallest point of the pen can disappear from the law before everything is fulfilled.
"Do not break even the smallest of God's commands, and do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep these commands and teach them to others, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"This is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder."
"You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not kill' (Exodus 20:13). Whoever kills will be accountable for it."
But I tell you, do not be angry with your brother or sister. Whoever is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, whoever says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ will be subject to the council. And whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the hell of fire.
"Suppose you are at the altar, about to offer your gift, and you remember that your brother has something against you."
Lay your gift down before the altar. First, go and reconcile with your brother, and then come back and present your gift.
"Suppose someone sues you and takes you to court. Try to resolve the issue quickly. Do this while you're still together. If you don't, they might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the police. And you might end up in jail."
What I'm about to tell you is true. Don't leave until you pay the last penny! Adultery.
"You have heard what was said: 'Do not commit adultery.'" (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just a part of your body. It is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell."
It is written: 'When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce' (Deuteronomy 24:1).
But I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
"And again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago, 'Do not break the covenant you made with the Lord, and do not break the oaths you swore to him.'"
As for me, this is what I say to you: Never make any such promises. Do not make them in the name of heaven. For this is God's throne.
Don't do it in the name of the Earth. That's the chair where you put the feet of the Lord. Don't do it in the name of Jerusalem. That's the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your heads. You cannot leave even a single hair, white or black.
"Let your 'yes' mean 'yes,' and your 'no' mean 'no.' Anything more than that is from the devil. Be kind to others."
"I heard what was said: 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, Deuteronomy 19:21).
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
Let's imagine someone takes you to court to take your shirt. Let him take your jacket too.
If someone forces you to walk one mile, walk two miles with him.
"Give to anyone who asks you. Do not refuse those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies."
"You have heard what was said: 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.'"
But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
And then the children of Bokum who are in heaven will take care of it. "He makes the sun rise on people who do good and on people who do evil. He sends rain on people who do the right thing and on people who don't do the right thing.
"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even tax collectors do the same."
If you submit, it's for the good of your people. What have you done more than others? Even the disbelievers do the same.
Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Providing assistance to people in need.
"Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will not give you a reward."
"When you give to the needy, do not boast about it or announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
"When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
And after that, the charity you give should be in secret. Your Lord, who owns everything, will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
"However you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners. They love for people to see them. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full."
"As you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret."
"When you pray, do not babble as the people who do not know God do. They love to be heard because they babble a lot."
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask him.
"This is the way you should pray." "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people who have wronged you. For if you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
"No matter what you eat, don't be as gloomy as those who put on a show of piety. They keep their faces very sad. They want to let people know they are fasting. What I am telling you now is true. They have received their full reward."
"If you refrain from eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face."
And that's why others don't know you are fasting. Only the unseen God knows this. He will give you the reward. God sees what happens in secret. Hide your wealth in heaven.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The eye is the lamp of the body. Suppose your eyes are in good condition, then your whole body will be full of light."
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
"No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and not like the other. You cannot serve both God and money at the same time. Do not even think about it."
"Do not be anxious about anything. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
"Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
"And why do you worry about clothing? Look how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothing."
As for me, I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these flowers.
"If God clothes the grass of the field so, will He not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very weak!"
"Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'"
People who don't fear God pant after all these things. The Father in heaven knows what you need.
"But you, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
They will judge you by the same standard by which you judge others. They will measure you by the same measure by which you measure others.
"You see a speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you do not notice the log in your own eye."
How do you tell your friend: "Let me remove the splinter of wood in your eye"? How do you say that when you have a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
"Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened unto you."
Everyone asks to receive. He who searches will find. The door opens for those who knock on it.
"If your child asked you for bread, who among you would give him a stone?"
"Or else he would ask for a fish, so who among you would give him a snake?"
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask Him!
"In everything, treat people the way you want them to treat you. That's what is written in the law and by the prophets. For great and small doors."
Enter the kingdom of my Father through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell. Many are those who enter by it.
But the gate is narrow and the way that leads to life is difficult. Only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You can know their true nature by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You know a tree by its fruit.
"Not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven."
"Many people will say to me on that day: 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?'"
And then we say to them clearly: "We don't know you. Stay away from me, you evil-doers!" The wise builder and the foolish builder.
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. Water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
"But whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand."
It rains. Water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. And it collapses with a loud noise.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one with authority, not as their religious teachers.
Jesus heals a man who had a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. And large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease knelt before Jesus and said, "Lord, if you choose to heal me, you can."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!" Immediately, the man was cured of his leprosy.
And Jesus said to him afterward: "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman centurion believes.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion met him. The centurion asked Jesus for help.
He said, "Oh Lord, my servant is lying in the house and cannot move. He is suffering a lot."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man subject to authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. And I say to that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
"I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
But those who consider themselves part of the kingdom will be cast into the outer darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
And Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! Let it be done as you have believed." And at that very hour, his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
And when evening came, many who were possessed by demons were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus comes at a cost.
Jesus saw the large crowd that was following him, so he told his disciples to get into the boat and go to the other side of Lake Galilee.
And then one of the teachers of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another disciple said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a strong storm blew across the lake. The waves began to strike the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils walked and overtook him. They said to him, "Teacher, save us! We are going to drown!"
He answered them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes, and encountered two men possessed by demons. They were coming from the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before the time of reckoning?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, saying, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned.
And the men who had been guarding the pigs fled. They went into the town and reported everything, including what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
And after that, the whole city went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own town.
Some men brought a paralytic man to Jesus. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Do not be afraid, my child. Your sins are forgiven."
And some of the religious teachers among them said, "This man is speaking evil."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk"?
"Truly I tell you, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and walked home.
When they saw this, they were all amazed. They glorified God, who had given such authority to men. Jesus called Matthew.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was dining at the house of Matthew. And a great number of tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and His disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what it means, “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.” (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners. Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day, the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new patch onto old clothes. The new fabric will tear away from the old fabric. This will only make the hole bigger.
"People don't pour new wine into old skins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. No, each one pours new wine into new skins. That way, both are preserved." A dead daughter and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was speaking, one of the synagogue rulers came and bowed down before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live again."
Jesus rose and went with him. And so did his disciples.
At that time, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and she touched the hem of his garment.
I thought: "I just need to touch his clothes, and I'll be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
And when Jesus entered the ruler's house, He saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After everyone else had gone out, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she stood up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
And after Jesus had left that place, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when Jesus came to the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they left and spread the news. They talked about it all over the place.
And as they were going out, they brought to him a mute man possessed by a demon.
When the demon had come out, the man spoke. And the crowd was amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
The Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." And a great multitude was gathered together.
Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
"Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his field to harvest."
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
The names of the twelve disciples are: first, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew; then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
After them were Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. And two others, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
"Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag with you on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. A worker should only take what he needs.
To enter a city or village, find someone willing to host you. Stay in their home until you leave.
As you enter the house, greet the people living there.
If this house welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. But if it doesn't welcome you, don't bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their house or that town."
What I'm about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah will be less severe than the fate of this city.
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."
Beware! The men will deliver you to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
So that they may be brought before governors and kings because of me, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.
"But when they arrest you, do not worry about how or what to speak. For in that hour, what you should speak will be given to you."
It's not you who will speak. Your father's voice will speak through you.
"Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and kill them."
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you now is true. You will not complete your journey through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
The pupil is no better than his teacher. The servant is no better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, how will the people who live with him be?
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything concealed will be exposed.
What is whispered to you in the dark, shout out in the light. What is murmured in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
"You can't buy two sparrows for money. But if not a single one of them fell to the ground, your father wouldn't know this."
And He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.
"And what should I do with someone who says in front of people that he knows me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven whom I know."
As for the person who says in front of people that they don't know me, I'll say in front of my Father in Heaven that I don't know Him.
"Don't think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace, but a sword."
Let's make the boys hate their fathers. Let the girls no longer obey their mothers. Let the daughters-in-law hate their mothers-in-law.
"A man's foes shall be they of his own household" (Micah 7:6).
"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
"Anyone who does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of being my disciple."
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
"Everyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and everyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That is so they can receive the reward of a prophet. And suppose someone welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person. That is so they can receive the reward of a righteous person.
Suppose someone even gave a glass of cold water to the little one following me. The words I'm about to tell you are true. That person will surely receive a reward.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus continued teaching his twelve disciples, and then went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we wait for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see.
The blind will have their sight restored. The disabled will walk. Those with skin diseases will be healed. The deaf will hear. The dead will be brought back to life. And the good news will be spread to the poor.
"They are blessed who do not lose their faith because of me."
And when John's disciples had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
"Otherwise, why did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are found in the palaces of kings."
And then, why did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, more than a prophet.
He is the one who was written about in the Holy Book. It says, "Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way before You" (Malachi 3:1).
"What I am about to tell you is true. No one is more important than John the Baptist, but the least important person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept that, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
"Who can I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to others, saying:
"We played the flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song. But you didn't mourn."
When John came, we didn't eat and we didn't drink like you. And people say: "He's possessed."
But the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds." Cities that do not turn from sin
Jesus began to denounce the cities where he had performed most of his miracles, because the people there had not repented of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to the depths of hell. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would still be existing."
"But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Rest for the weary.
Jesus said at that time, "I thank you, Father. You are Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and have revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. A father is the only one who knows the son, and the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to introduce him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Become my disciples and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick and eat the wheat.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
And so he entered the house of the Lord. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which only the priests were allowed to eat.
Haven't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath the priests in the temple must serve on that day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
We're telling you that something here is more important than the temple.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
And after he left that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a weak and crooked hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than a sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they could kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
This was to fulfill the prophecy spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said:
"This is My servant whom I have chosen, My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased. I will put My Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
He won't argue and he won't shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent twig. He will not quench a feeble flame. He will mend everything.
"The peoples will put their hope in him" (Isaiah 42:1-4). Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought to Jesus a man possessed by a demon. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man could speak and see.
Everyone was amazed. They said, "Is this the son of David?"
And the Pharisees heard this saying, and said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul, but by whose power do your followers cast them out? Therefore, your followers will judge you.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
"Or consider this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take what he has? First, you must tie him up. Then you can steal his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
That is what I am telling you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But the evil word spoken against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come.
"A good tree bears good fruit, a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"O den of venomous snakes! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts."
A good man speaks good words. These words come from the goodness hidden in his heart. An evil man speaks evil words. These words come from the evil hidden in his heart.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, or by your words you will be condemned." The sign of Jonah, the miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you."
He answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
"The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation. And the Ninevites will prove this generation guilty, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now something greater than Jonah is here."
"The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here."
"What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It wanders through dry places, looking for a place to rest. But it cannot find one."
And then he says, "I'll go back to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
And afterward, the unclean spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself. They enter and dwell there, and the man's condition becomes worse than before. That is how it will be with this wicked generation." Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
"Everyone does what they want, but He who is in heaven is my brother, my sister, or my mother."
The Farmer's Tale
And on the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. And all the people stood on the shore.
And then he told them many things through stories. He said, "There was a farmer who went out to sow his seeds.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on a rocky place with little soil. The plants grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
By the time the sun came up, the plants were scorched. They withered because they had no roots.
And other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And other seeds fell on good soil. They sprouted, grew, and produced a crop a hundred times greater, sixty times greater, and thirty times greater than what was planted.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students came and asked him, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. This opportunity has not been given to outsiders.
Everyone has this kind of knowledge to take more. In fact, to have a lot. If anyone doesn't have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken from them.
This is why we use stories when we talk to people. We say: "They see, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said: "You will indeed hear, but you will never understand. You will indeed see, but you will never perceive."
"The hearts of these people are calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn back to me and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see, but they did not. They wished to hear what you hear, but they did not.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
But others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy at once.
As for them, they have no roots. That's why they don't last long. They quickly abandon the religion when they face a problem or suffer because of the message.
As for the seeds that fell among the thorns, these are the ones who hear the message, but the worries of this life and the deceitful wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
As for the rest, they received the seeds that fell on the good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop thirty, sixty, or a hundred times what was planted." The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
While everyone was sleeping, the enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then fled.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
"The slave owner came to him and said, 'Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did these weeds come from?'"
"That's what an enemy would do," he replied. The servants asked, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
"No," answered the owner. "In weeding out the weeds, you might uproot the wheat as well.
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn. Then, gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field.
This is the smallest seed you have. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the whole garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast. A woman took a little yeast and mixed it with a large amount of flour until it had worked through the whole batch of dough."
Jesus said all these things to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable.
And so the words of the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak of things hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalms 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
And after this, Jesus went out from among the people and walked to the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered: "The son of man is he who sows the good seeds.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send His angels. He will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin. He will also get rid of everyone who does evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
And after this, the followers of God will shine like the rays of the sun in their Father's kingdom. To those who have ears to hear. Tales of hidden treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; and in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that had a great deal of value. That's how he went and sold everything he had. And he bought a halo. The story of the network.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and caught all kinds of fish."
And as they aged, the fishermen pulled them ashore. Then they sat and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
This is how the Day of Judgment will be. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
So that the disbelievers may be thrown into the blazing fire of Hell. Therein the disbelievers will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old ones." A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.
And when Jesus had finished telling these stories, he left that place.
He went to his hometown, Nazareth. And he began to teach the people in their synagogue. And they were amazed. And they said, "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get the power to do these miracles?"
"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?"
Does he have all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not all satisfied with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
What deeds were not a few miracles there because they had no faith.
The beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why he has the power to do these miracles."
Herod seized John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She had been the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "Whatever you do, don't take it illegally."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was greatly pleased with her.
And thus he promised her and swore that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother said to her, "What shall I say?" So she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. But he thought of his promise and his guests whom he had invited for dinner. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
They brought him his head on a large platter and gave it to the girl. Then she picked it up and gave it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus provided food for five thousand men.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt great compassion for them. And he healed their sick.
And when the time drew near for the evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the time is now late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
Jesus answered them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We only have five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them here to me," he said.
And afterward, Jesus said to the people, "Sit down on the grass." He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks to God. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments that were left.
The number of men who ate was almost 5000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida.
And after he had sent them away, he went up into the mountain to pray by himself. And when evening had come, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to meet his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. They said, "This is a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
And immediately Jesus called out to them, saying, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But Peter, when he saw the wind, was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and grabbed him. He said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt Me?"
As they got into the boat, the wind died down.
And those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
And they crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. They sent a message throughout all the surrounding districts. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to have the sick people only touch the edge of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
And some of the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus and asked him,
Why don't your students listen to the sensible advice? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commands of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you have received from us is a pure gift from God."
That's why they shouldn't honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God to follow your teachings.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right about you when he said:
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to them. They teach man-made rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
"What goes into your mouth doesn't defile you; what comes out of your mouth does."
And his disciples came to him. And they asked him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant, and they will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you still not understand?" asked Jesus.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth ends up in the stomach. And then it comes out of the body.
But the words that come out of the mouth come from the heart. That's what makes you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
"These are the things that make you 'unclean.' But eating without washing your hands does not make you 'unclean.' A woman from Canaan had faith."
Jesus left the region of Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A woman from Canaan came and begged him, saying, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. And his disciples came to him. And they asked him, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And then, the woman knelt before him. "Oh, sir! Help me!" she said.
He replied: "We can't take the children's bread and give it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
And Jesus answered and said, "O woman, you have great faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds four thousand.
Jesus went from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd gathered around him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them before Jesus, and he healed them.
People marveled. Those who could not speak began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind began to see. This is how the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
Take the seven loaves and the fish and give thanks. Then break them and give them to your disciples. And the disciples distributed the bread to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards the disciples gathered seven baskets of the leftover fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He went aboard the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
They asked Jesus to perform a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today there will be a storm, the sky is red and full of clouds." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The students walked to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked to each other about this matter. They said, "He's saying this because we didn't bring bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "Your faith is very small. Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?"
Didn't you understand it just now? Didn't you remember the five loaves that were enough for five thousand people? Didn't you remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves that fed the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And the disciples understood then that Jesus was not warning them about the yeast they used in their bread, but was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said that Jesus was the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered and said, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"As for you, what's your opinion?" he asked. "You're not going to say it's me, are you?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus spoke of his coming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He said that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He would be killed, and on the third day he would be死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死cıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcı
And Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses their soul? Or what can a person exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory, accompanied by his angels. Then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
"What I am going to tell you is true. Some of those standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus was transformed.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, up a high mountain, where they were alone.
And there before them his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. And a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were very afraid and fell facedown on the ground.
But Jesus approached and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
And as they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen." "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
His disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has indeed come, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
And the disciples understood then that Jesus was speaking of John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
And when they came to the crowd, one of the men went up to Jesus and knelt down before him.
He said, "Oh Lord, have mercy on my son, for he trembles greatly and suffers much. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought my students to you, but they couldn't cure him.
"You people have no faith and are evil!" Jesus answered. "How long have I been with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy here."
Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the boy, and it came out of him. And he was healed immediately.
And afterward, the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why could we not cast out the evil spirit?"
He replied, "Because your faith is very weak. What I am about to tell you is the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move.αντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντί

They met in Galilee. And Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.
"So that he may be killed. And on the third day he will rise from the dead." And after that, the disciples felt great sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
When Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or taxes? From their sons or from others?"
"I am from others," Peter answered. Jesus said to him, "Then the children do not need to pay."
"But we don't want to upset them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the coin you need exactly. Take it and give it to them as a tax on me and you." vide
