Jesus called a little child to him and asked the child to stand among them.
Jesus said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
khoae person feels a sense of pride akin to cradling a child, akin to cradling the child of cradling a student, akin to cradling the student of cradling a child. (Note: The original Arabic sentence structure is complex and poetic, using repetition and nested clauses to convey a sense of pride and connection. The English translation attempts to capture this essence while maintaining grammatical correctness.)
"Whoever welcomes one such little child in my name, welcomes me."
"But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."

"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
"Never despise one of these little ones. This is what I am telling you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my Father in heaven."

"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go to look for the one that is lost?"
"What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds this one sheep, he will rejoice more over it than over the ninety-nine that were not lost."
This is the same for your Father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost. When one sins against you
"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back."
"If he refuses to listen to you, take one or two others along with you. As the Scriptures say, 'On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter is to be confirmed' (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
"What you seal on earth will be sealed in heaven. And what you open on earth will be opened in heaven."
"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The servant who has no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
As soon as the king started acting like that, he brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay. Then his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything they owned had to be sold to pay off the debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him. He pleaded, "Give me time, I'll pay you back everything."
Siddo felt pity for him. He forgave him for what he owed and let him go.
"But then the servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me back the money you owe me!'"
The other server fell to his knees. "Give me time," they pleaded, "to give you your money back."
The first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other slaves saw what happened. It upset them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
After that, the master called the first slave and said to him, "You wicked slave, I forgive you all the debts you owe me because you asked me to do this."
"You should have had mercy on the other servant as I had mercy on you."
His master was angry with him and handed him over to the guards. He was to be punished until he paid back everything he owed.
"This is how My Father in heaven treats you, unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished speaking, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator 'made them male and female' from the beginning?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer a couple, but one. So a man should not separate what God has joined.
They said, "But why did Moses command the man to give his wife a divorce letter and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man cannot divorce his wife unless she has died.
The students said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who are given the ability to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Others are made that way by other people. And others make themselves that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so." They brought little children to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which one?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have obeyed all these commandments," said the young man. "What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all you have and give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard these words, he walked away sadly. He was very rich.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they said, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus saw them and said to them, "This is impossible for humans, but for God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left all and followed you; what then will there be for us?"
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. And those who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone has left their homes, families, and fields because of me, to receive a hundredfold, and also eternal life.
But those who were first will be last, and those who were last will be first.
The Tale of the Workers in the Vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owns a vineyard. Early in the morning, he went out to hire laborers for his vineyard."
He agreed to pay them the regular wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out again around 9 a.m. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "You too, go work in my vineyard. I will give you the wage you deserve."
And that's how it went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing there. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
And when evening came, the master of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired, and then the first."
The workers who worked on the five o'clock shift have arrived. Each of them received their regular daily wage.
And when the first workers came, they expected to receive more. But each of them received the same daily wage as usual.
"As soon as they received it, they started complaining about the owner."
They said: "These people who were hired last only worked for an hour, and you gave them the same pay as us. We worked longer and stayed in the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Keep your money and leave. I want to pay the people I hired the same amount you were paid.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave to others freely?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his coming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Taking the twelve disciples aside in private, he began to tell them what was going to happen to him.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "There the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death..."
"And then they will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. They will mock him and beat him with a whip. They will crucify him. And on the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt before him and asked a favor of him.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other will sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. Whoever among you wants to be great must be your servant.
And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave.
"Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others and give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd was following them.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, and asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
"Oh Lord," they answered, "we want to start seeing."
Jesus felt great compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied up, with a colt by her side. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away.
This is so that the words spoken by the prophet may be fulfilled. It is written:
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you; He is humble, and rides on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus had told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their garments on them. Then Jesus sat on the garments.
A very large crowd of people spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and scattered them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed behind. And they all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalms 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heavens!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind and disabled people came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miracles he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. And Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
And afterward, Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He walked to it and found only leaves. He said to it, "You shall never bear fruit again!" And immediately the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Questioning Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'"
"What if we say 'of men'? We fear men. Everyone believes that John was a prophet."
So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said to them, "Neither can I tell you by what authority I do these things." - The story of the two sons
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'"
"I'm not going to do that," the boy replied. However, he changed his mind and left.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, "Yes, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed in him. You have seen this. Yet you did not repent of your sins and did not believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
"Listen to another parable. A man had a vineyard, and he planted it with vines; he built a fence around it, dug a winepress, and built a tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenants and went to another country."
As the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to hire laborers. He told the laborers to gather his share of the fruits.
As for the tenants, they seized their servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
And after that, the man sent other servants to the vineyard. He sent more than he had sent the first time, and they treated the servants the same way.
"And finally, he sent his son. He said, 'So that they may respect my son.'
"As for the tenants, they saw the boy coming. They said to each other, 'This is the one who will one day take all the owner's possessions. Let's kill him, and everything will be ours.'"
And so they caught him, expelled him from the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?
"He's going to kill those bad people," they said. "And then he'll rent the field to others. And they'll give him a share of the harvest when it's time to reap."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"That's why I tell you: so that they may take away your heavenly kingdom and give it to people who will bear fruit with it."
Anyone who falls on that rock will be broken into pieces. But the rock will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. And they knew that he was speaking about them.
And so they began to look for a way to seize him. But they were afraid of the crowds. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
And Jesus continued to tell them other parables, saying:
"This is like the kingdom of heaven: A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servants to the people he had invited to dinner. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
"Then he sent out other servants. He said: 'Tell the invited guests, "I have prepared my dinner, slaughtered my fattened calves and cows, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet."'
As for the people, they didn't care, so one of them went to his field, and another went to his work.
The rest were taken captive. They mistreated them and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
And the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited do not deserve to come.
Go to the corners of the streets. Call everyone you find to have dinner with you.
And so the slaves went out into the street. They gathered all the people they found, whether good or bad. And in a short time, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you get in here without wearing your wedding clothes?" The man had nothing to say.
And the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. Outside, people weep and gnash their teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are an honest man and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, no matter how important they are.
Tell us, what do you think? Should we pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, "Hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency people use to pay their taxes. He brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
And when they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. "The dead will rise when they hear."
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question. They do not believe that people are raised from the dead.
"Master," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his brother's name.
We were seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. And the same thing happened with the seventh brother.
And in the end, the woman died.
And now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
"And what will we do if the dead rise? Didn't you read what the Lord said?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
And those who heard this marvelled at his teaching, for he taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. The primary commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. He asked Jesus a question to test him.
He said to him, "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
And the second is like it: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." Whose son will the Christ be?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What is your opinion about Christ? Whose son is he?" "He is the son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David's mouth."
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. And after that day, no one dared to ask him any questions again.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
"If you have to obey them, do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach."
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves do not want to lift a finger to move them.
"Everything they do, they do it to be seen by people. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Holy Book. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their robes very long."
They love to take the foremost places at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love it when people call them "Rabbi."
"But you are not to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on earth "Father," for you have only one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not call anyone "teacher." You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Everyone who raises himself will be brought down, and everyone who is brought down will be raised up.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are trying to enter go in."

Signs of the Last Day
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came to him. They pointed out the temple buildings to him.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being led astray.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ," and they will deceive many people.
"You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about the wars that will happen in the future. Don't be afraid. These things must happen. But the end is not here yet.
Nations will fight each other. Kingdoms will fight each other. People will starve. There will be earthquakes in many places.
These are all just the beginning of the birth pains.
"And after that, all people will greet you, torture you, and kill you. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will abandon their religion. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
As evil grew, love cooled in the hearts of most people.
But whoever perseveres to the end will be saved.
This joyful news of the kingdom will be spread throughout the whole world. It will be a witness to all nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination of desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day, you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.

If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But it will be shortened for the sake of God's chosen people.
"At that time, someone may say to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' Do not believe it.
The false Christ and false prophets will appear. To perform great miracles and signs. To try to deceive the chosen people of God if they can.

They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the floods came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and the other left.
"Therefore be watchful, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. If the homeowner knew when the thief would come at night, he would have been watching. He wouldn't have left his house vulnerable to theft.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's imagine that a master appointed one of his servants to oversee the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to provide them with their food at the right time. The master wants an honest and intelligent servant to fulfill this duty.
It will be good for the servant if the master returns and finds him doing his job.
What I am about to tell you is true. The master will give this slave responsibility over everything he owns.
But suppose this servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master will be long in returning.'
Suppose he started beating the other servants. And suppose he started eating and drinking with those who drink a lot.
The master of this servant will return on a day when the servant does not expect him. He will return at a time when the servant does not know.
And then they will cut Mr. Haller into pieces. And they will send him to the place where liars go. And everyone will cry and gnash their teeth.
Tale of Ten Maids
"That is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
In the afternoon, they took their lanterns, but they didn't take olive oil with them.
At noon, take the oil in their small bottles with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. That's how all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they answered. "There may not be enough for us all. Go instead to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
"And they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the groom arrived. He entered with the bride's maids of honor, who were ready for the wedding feast. And then the door was closed."
Then, the other brides came too. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But they answered: "What we are going to tell you is true. We don't know you."
"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. The parable of the three servants.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one man. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew they could handle. And then he went on his journey.
The servant who took the ten thousand dollars went straight ahead and invested his money. He made an additional ten thousand dollars.
He who wins $4000 wins an extra $4000.
As for the man who took two thousand dollars, he walked away and dug a hole in the ground, hiding his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of the slaves returned. He loved to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who took $10,000 brought another $10,000 with him. He said, "Sir, you trusted me and gave me $10,000. Look, I made an extra $10,000."
The master answered: "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Come and share in your master's joy!"
"The guy with the $4000 came too. He said, 'Boss, you trusted me and gave me $4000. Look, I made an extra $4000.'"
The master answered: "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Come and share in your master's joy!"
"And then, the man who had received $2000 came. He said, "My lord, I knew you were a harsh man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not plant seeds."
That's why I was afraid. I went out and hid your money, $2000, in the ground. Look, this is your money.
Answered the master: "You wicked and lazy servant! Don't you know that we reap where we did not sow? Do you know that we gather the harvest where we did not plant the seeds?"
Ideally, you should have put my money in the bank. When we return, I would have collected it with interest.
"Then the master said to his servants, 'Take the thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has ten thousand dollars.'
Everyone has more than they need. More than they can use. What happens to those who have nothing? Even those who have something will have it taken away from them.
'Drive out this worthless servant into the outer darkness. There, in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.' Sheep and goats
"The Son of Man is going to come in his glory, accompanied by all the angels. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will drive the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.'
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
"Then the righteous will answer: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
"When have we seen you sick or in prison and came to visit you?"
The king will answer: "What I tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of my least important brothers, you have done for me."
"Then he will say to those on his left, 'You are cursed! Depart from me and go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in. I was in need of clothes, and you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison, but you did not take care of me.
And they also ask: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?"
He answers them: "What I am telling you is true. Whatever you did not do for the least of these, you did not do for me."
"And then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done good will receive eternal life."
The plan to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. They will hand over the Son of Man to be crucified.
And afterward the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled together in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They plotted to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him.
"But it's not the feast day," they said. "People might cause trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he was seated at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said to them, "Why this much waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
There will always be poor people with you, but I will not always be with you.
She sprayed perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What she did will be remembered everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world. She will be remembered for this." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve disciples went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time Judas sought opportunity to betray him. The Lord's Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He answered them, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
And so the disciples did as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The students were very sad. One by one, they started saying: "Not me, sir, right?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. Woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had never been born.
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, surely?" Jesus answered, "Yes, you."
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
And then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "All of you, drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
I've had enough of you. From this moment on, I'll no longer drink with you until the day we drink together in the kingdom of Boiya.
And then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me tonight. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7).
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
"Everyone else might abandon you, but I won't. I would never do that."
"What I'm telling you is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
But Peter said, "I will never deny you, even if I must die with you." And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. And he began to feel sorrowful and deeply distressed.
And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell face-first to the ground. He prayed and said, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But let your will be done, not mine."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Watch and pray. That's how you avoid sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus walked away again. He prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; but if I must drink it, let your will be done."
And then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
And so he left them and went away again. For the third time he prayed and asked for the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Rise up! We must go! Here comes he that will betray me unto them!" The arrest of Jesus.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived, one of the twelve disciples. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, had agreed with them on a signal. He said, "Whomever I kiss is the man; seize him."
And Judas immediately went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that time, one of Jesus' disciples reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father to help me? He can send an army of over 70,000 angels instantly.
But how can sacred books come into being? They say that it must happen in this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowds. He asked them, "Do I lead a band of armed men against you? Was it necessary for you to come with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this happened so that the prophecies of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
The people who seized Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the elders had gathered with him that day.
And Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and went in and sat with the guards to see the end.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.
But they didn't find any evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses arrived.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes, things are as you said," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all: In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
And after that, the high priest tore his clothes and said, "This man has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You heard him say those blasphemous words.
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
And then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter says he does not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But before them all, Peter said, "I am not." "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
And he went out by the gate that leads to the house. And he saw him there again. And she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't so. And he swore, saying, "I do not know this man!"
After a while, the people who had been standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
And Peter began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw those who had condemned Jesus to death. He felt ashamed and deeply grieved for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I have sinned," he said. "I have delivered an innocent man." "What does it matter to us?" they replied. "That is your concern."
And so Judas threw the money in the temple and left. And then he went away and hanged himself.
The high priests collected the money. They said, "We cannot put this money in the temple's treasury. This is blood money. This is money paid to have a man killed."
That's how they decided to use money to buy pottery land. People from other countries will be buried there.
And for this reason, this place is called the Field of Blood to this day.
And so were fulfilled the words that the prophet Jeremiah had spoken: "They paid thirty pieces of silver, the price that the sons of Israel had set for him."
"And they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said to me, 'Throw it to the potter'—the handsome price at which
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
And then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are making against you?"
But Jesus made no reply to any of the accusations, even to the one charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whoever they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
And as they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
Now while Pilate was sitting on his judgment seat, his wife sent to him this message: "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."
As for the chief priests and elders, they persuaded the crowds to ask for the release of Barabbas and the execution of Jesus.
"Which of the two do you wish me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall we do then with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder: "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
Answer to all people: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death."
Pilate released Barabbas, but he ordered Jesus to be flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers seized Jesus and led him into the palace, which they called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
And then they took branches of a thorn bush and made a crown out of it. They placed it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and began to mock him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
And as they led him out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with myrrh and offered it to Jesus to drink. But after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat and kept watching him there.
And they placed a sign above his head with the charge against him written on it. It read: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
The people who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
And they said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
And so it was, that the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and the elders, mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him. He who said, "I am the Son of God."
And in the same way, the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
At about three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
And some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus, said, "This man is calling Elijah."
And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
And the rest said, "Leave him, let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the curtain in the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The graves were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep arose.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. And they appeared to many people there.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what happened. They were very afraid. They said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was there. So was Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John, whose father was Zebedee. They buried Jesus.
And as the evening was coming on, a rich man from Arimathea came, whose name was Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean cloth.
They placed him in the new tomb they had cut out of the rock. They rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. And then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The day after was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
"Make sure the tomb is secured until the third day. If you don't, his disciples will come and steal the body, and then they will tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. This final lie will be worse than the first one."
"I have a few guards with me," Pilate answered. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
And so they went and secured the tomb. They sealed the stone and posted guards to watch over it.
Jesus rises from the dead.
And so, the Sabbath was over. And at the first light of the week's first day, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a great earthquake. And the angel of the Lord descended from heaven. He came to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified that they trembled and turned as pale as ghosts.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He's not here! He's gone, as he said he would. Come and see the place where he was sleeping.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is my message for you.
And so, the women came out of the tomb quickly. They were afraid, but they were very joyful. They ran to tell the disciples.
And suddenly, Jesus appeared to them and said, "Peace be with you." They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
And Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards went and told the chief priests.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
And when the chief priests and the elders met together, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears about this report, we'll bribe him. That way, you won't face any problems.
And that's how the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story spread among all the Jews and is still believed today. The last commands Jesus gave to his disciples were...
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw it, they worshiped it. However, there were still some among them who had doubts.
And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And so came John. He baptized people in the desert. He taught them how to be baptized and to repent of their sins, so that God might forgive them.
All the people who lived in the Judean countryside came to him. Even people from Jerusalem came. And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
"It is he who comes after me, the one who is stronger than I. I am not worthy even to stoop down and untie his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." - The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up from the water. And at that moment he saw the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
He heard a voice speaking to him from heaven: "You are my son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days, and the devil tested him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus, and angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After they arrested John, Jesus went to Galilee and began preaching the gospel of the Lord.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of my Lord is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And immediately, they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.
And immediately he called them, and they left their nets and followed him. And they went into the boat with him and his disciples. And a great storm of wi
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach there.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
At that time, a man in their mosque shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then, with a scream, it exited him.
Everyone was amazed. They said to each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! Even the evil spirits obey him and bow down before him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and went straight to the home of Simon and Andrew, accompanied by James and John.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
And he took her hand and helped her stand up. And the fever left her. And she began to serve them.
In the evening, after sunset, all the sick and those possessed by demons were brought to Jesus.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus went out to a solitary place to pray.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness had not yet lifted. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Simon and his friends walked to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
And so he went throughout all the region of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus and begged him on his knees. He said, "If you choose to purify me, you can."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be 'clean'!"
The disease left him. He recovered and left.
Jesus threw him out immediately. He gave the man a strong warning.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this. Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be evidence for the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
As for the man, he went out and began to proclaim it loudly. So that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. But he remained in secluded places, and people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. And the people heard that He had come home.
There was a large crowd of people who gathered together until there was no more room. There was not even any room outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
"Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something really bad! Only God can forgive sins!"
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
"Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched him. And all the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
And again Jesus came to the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd gathered around him. And he began to teach them.
And as he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
And afterward, Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. And a large number of tax collectors and sinners were dining with him and his disciples. And they were part of the large crowds that were following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. They asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees fast. Some people came to Jesus and said, "The disciples of John fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast. But your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as he is with them.
As for the time the groom will take to come to them, on this day they will not eat anything.
"People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do that, the new piece will tear away from the old one, and the hole will become bigger."
People don't put new wine in old skins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be lost. No, they put new wine in new skins. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath vocab
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through wheat fields with his disciples. And the disciples began to pluck the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is against the law on the Sabbath."
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
This was at the time when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave some to his companions also.
And Jesus said, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
At another time, Jesus entered the synagogue. And there was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and crooked hand. He said to him, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they remained silent.
Jesus looked around in anger. He was deeply disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as before.
And after this the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus walked with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and great crowds from Galilee followed them.
When the people heard all that Jesus was doing, many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him so that the people would not crowd around him.
Jesus healed many people. That's why those who were sick pushed themselves to touch him.
When the people saw the evil spirits, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up to the mountain. He called people to come to him, and they came.
And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach.
They had authority to cast out demons.
And so Jesus appointed the twelve disciples. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder."
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. And Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. And again a crowd gathered. The number was so great that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it and went to get him. They said, "He has no mind."
There were some teachers of the law who came from Jerusalem and said, "This man is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he drives out demons."
And so Jesus called them and began to tell them parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If the kingdom is fighting itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
