khoa, I want to
khoa! Sultan, what are you saying?
This is a shame! It's an opportunity we shouldn't all waste.
Likewise, I don't interfere. I have the right to take, and you actually have the right to take before me.
khoaan, may God keep your family, don't bring us problems.
Salih, don't be..., forgive me God!
"Please, would a brother advise his brother with what you're saying?"
khoaf you are hungry
And I found a great feast.
The holiday is not owned by anyone.
Say this to yourself.
This holiday won't be in front of us again.
Don't be a stranger, Saleh!
And take the opportunity from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he is afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone is involved in it.
This is the rule!
Even people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control of the situation.
International Third Millennium Beaches, specifically, the first phase of infrastructure.
As stupid as this.
This is the place where we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to exploit her.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who used to drive him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you the money to fill up your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and don't be stubborn.
Take advantage of some benefits.
See Uncle Thursday.
And now, as you say, they're calling him a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The other third is a commission.
The person who plays in a popular music band,
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
You know what they did.
He added a zero.
No use, oh! Auntie
No, God will guide him if He wills it.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
For good to prevail.
And God willing, it is good that will prevail.
This is common.
Keep this matter between us.
Don't talk to anyone about this matter.
Should we be worried?
But my friends
Very annoying.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two hours in the morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him soon.
And we have to convince him.
He's cutting off the benefits we receive.
They had already forced him to change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Osman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day of work.
Rely on me.
How you can't get it!
Certainly. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and walking down the street
Will you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The dish is large.
We're still working on the draft for the meeting.
If you're not okay,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
It's legitimate.
May God guide you, Saleh!
This is reasonable because you're a boss for the first time in your life.
This is very simple.
We will include our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So that no one suspects what we're doing.
Let's put our share as a separate item!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
Impossible
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Let's assume that the car is his friend's car.
And in a very special location as well!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear that from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to get anything?
We'll end up with nothing!
He wants to eat it alone, one bite at a time.
Don't move your head!
Nor is your brother like that.
Sit down and everything will be alright.
I talked to him all night.
I told him that, whatever the case, they are your relatives.
He finally agreed.
This is how things are supposed to be.
And we hope you won't get it just once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
Specifically, infrastructure.
And they will start the second phase later.
And it will continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
It's good that you pressured him into agreeing.
You're no different from them.
But, it doesn't matter.
I hope you explained the matter to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said that only after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to set the project budget.
They have to follow up, it's their money.
We've identified it and we're certain of it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my son-in-law and he partners with me.
Do you mean that?
They are responsible for the doors, windows, and everything related to completing the job.
Good, good
How much do you want to finish?
How much will you get?
What happens is that we take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And they specified the amount of money we will receive.
You have people waiting and wanting something.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million,
Everyone will think carefully during this week.
They specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will have made their decision and determined the quantity they want.
This is none of your business.
Then, it's up to you?
Ignore him.
Hey, buddy, what's up? What's wrong with him?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hey! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Salih, is your brother's name Sultan?
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he gives us a lift when our car is out of order.
Write.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are three other people.
What else can I do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and be done."
No, no, this will cost a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
Poor him, does he have any children?
Yes, he has, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They're adding it by force.
How much are you going to give them?
This is too much.
This is my mother; we were just talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, this is the last one Oh! My son
No, oh! My son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's the problem?
Why are you upset?
Only from the first phase, specifically the infrastructure.
Not used
Add three thousand.
Buy me watches from Thailand with sparkling strass.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mother.
No, Mom, I added her. I just wanted to check the name.
My beloved, my mother.
Let's expand the celebration.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow's meeting is the last one and everyone must decide on the amount of money they want.
I got this.
Is one million enough!
This is too much, my dear.
Oh! Guys, oh! Guys, wait, there's noise, give us a chance.
The committee is in session now to approve the project budget, and financial matters should not be discussed at this time, that's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry's square.
Oh, we're screaming, don't draw attention to us.
If anyone comes and asks what's happening with all of you here
We'll tell him that the power is out or that you got a shock.
Don't make noise in the ministry's square.
%pw Silent %pw Silent
Thread! Can you hear me?
"If I were with them, what would the budget be now?"
Without counting my brother
In full, 50 million %pw.
Fifty million dollars is just for the first phase.
How much is it now?
What, Saleh?
Participation is caring, man!
In any case, cheers.
Hurry up, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The most important thing is that we don't want any discussions. Let them agree on the budget and that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of the community.
May God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beaches Project.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
This is for future generations.
Certainly, and on behalf of our show's team, we would like to greet and congratulate you on the inauguration of the project, which will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
Which took us two million and a half years.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
May God preserve the blessing of oil for us.
Second stage, third stage, and tenth stage.
actor
Welcome aboard.
Why have we been gathered here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Where should they take us?
Praise be to God, I have grown old and become senile.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they isolate you?
Iman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wondered who had lied to her and given her incorrect information.
This is not the Earth.
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father's farm.
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
You have brothers.
Those who work hard, invest in land, real estate, and businesses, and make an effort.
Free from headaches.
I am disappointed in you, Iman!
And also, my sister.
How don't you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
Nothing is better than the truth.
Because money
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nine years and ten years, if not more.
No, but
The brothers of Umm Sulaym are thieves.
Poor thing, she told me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
What do you know?
I'm not saying your brothers are like hers, God willing they're not.
How many years have passed since my father's death so far?
Why is she asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Isn't the check paid to her every three months?
Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
This is none of her business.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't have gotten even a single riya.
I understood.
Where from?
It's like it's not my money.
Look what, Monira
Please look at him.
Becomes fifty thousand.
Because I had the courage to ask about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Each of them lives in a villa like this.
And their children study in the best schools.
What can I say, oh! Manar
I won't stop fighting for my right.
I will get my revenge.
It's best to invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
People have lost all compassion.
Don't think your brothers will be any better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court frequently.
And in the end
I didn't gain anything from this.
Why are they doing that?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear, be nice to them.
Treat them kindly.
And you'll get tired of them.
And why do the courts take so long?
We are all four hundred thousand people.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I really doubt, my dear, that any order will be given.
Look at my brothers.
I swear I don't want all that.
What can I say, oh dear!
I can only say that God alone is enough for us, and He is the best manager of our affairs.
"We seek Allah's help and rely on Him."
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, oh! My dear
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this several times.
My love, they will invest millions, and you will just watch them.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And no one will take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'll be satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Just some questions about her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can't find it
I'll take you and show you.
He will find his way.
I signed a waiver.
Two hundred and fifty is more than enough for her, as her husband works.
Take it or forget it.
Why are you asking for that now?
But he is greedy.
As if it's not my right.
This is my father's inheritance, and he wants to decide how much I should take. Take it or leave it.
It's not for me or him to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect this from them.
This is because of the money.
It was opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, oh! Nasser
It's easy to know lands, buildings, and real estate.
I don't know how much they take.
And the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
And I won't leave them alone.
How are you going to get back to them?
This is none of your business.
This is none of your business either, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him a power of attorney.
that allows him to inspect almost everything in the company
Falcon, Saad
He's shouting at us.
Falcon, enough.
Brother Nasser
Sorry, I'll take
Yes, sir.
You go now.
Excuse me, go.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
And now, if he goes and sues us,
He said you hit him.
So, do we let him do what he wants?
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to examine everything.
If only he had looked at the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he checks the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight.
Divide it into three parts.
Thirty-two
You know how much.
This is the amount we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, we are not afraid.
If he doesn't agree, this is what we have, and if he agrees, welcome.
Let them go and deal with it.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what it was supposed to be like from the beginning.
Yes, boss.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
Brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, my lord.
File by file
When she knew her true heritage,
Villas, lands, and properties you knew nothing about.
It turned out there were seven of them.
It turned out that they were sixteen people.
She didn't know.
She was poor and shocked.
This is not fair.
Don't leave them alone.
Please, my son, I don't want to hear anything about courts!
The more interested you are,
The less the judge knows,
For half a minute
Then he will say his usual phrase,
To the seventh, the fourth, the two thousand, I don't know how much.
They will be very happy, my son.
You're not supposed to get out of your bed ever! Oh, Mom!
May God heal you.
No, no, please come.
Naseer and my sister Manar
After we slammed the door in his face and threw him out of the company.
He sends one of my classmates from back in school.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
We hope he does that.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but report.
Delays and arguments, and useless lawyers.
The years pass by.
And the years pass by.
And you're not going to get a single Riyal.
God have mercy on Umm Sulaym.
You advised me the day before she died.
Never go to court.
He said that our courts
She died without taking anything from her inheritance.
She died, but the judge has not yet ruled on her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello, Abdullah.
Brother Abdullah
The years passed.
This is my brother Saad.
I wish you to grow in grace.
The most important thing
Is it the brotherhood?
Brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't let financial problems get to you.
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry
Why do I have to ask him to stop talking?
He is right.
They don't even want me to get my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife...
Her father works as a messenger at the ministry.
All this is from my father's money.
We've waited for too long.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them your friend Abdullah.
They didn't respect him; they even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
He said for sure, Nasser.
Don't worry.
Scaring them with the law.
Did you forget what poor Umm Salym said about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Umm Sulaym do not fear the courts.
But my brothers
They can be afraid of rumors.
They might feel ashamed to go to court.
To wait and see what will happen after Sheikh Abdurrahman visits them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What do you say, son?
He is telling the truth.
Go away, %pw go away
Going to court tomorrow morning.
Why do I have to postpone the matter until day after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What will happen if you wait until tomorrow's tomorrow?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you this before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he's begging me to postpone going to court.
Because they know you're serious about this, dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this is it.
God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of a courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
God have mercy on you.
Haven't you said?
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until after tomorrow.
To obtain this sample of the courthouse building, %pw by %pw.
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through this door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
Put all your stuff there.
The mobile phone and anything metallic so it doesn't beep beep beep beep beep.
You log the case, they'll ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight, the elevator you take.
Go around the offices.
Meet the judge, if you need a particular judge, for instance.
Also, these.
You want to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you'll get your due.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're having dinner at my sister's house today.
Oh, has the ministry approved his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, he couldn't believe it.
He said that if they approve the project, I'll invite you for dinner at my house.
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
How happy you are, Bou Waleed!
He is lucky.
My sister told me that he was so happy that he couldn't sleep last night.
Alhamdulillah! Oh! Manal
He is not familiar with the business, but some good men helped him.
Okay, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the meal.
"Thank you, oh! Boy, Waleed"
Thank you, Oh! Bu Waleed, may God bless you.
May God fill your life with wealth.
Very delicious food, Um Waleed.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me to just rent an office, and they would take care of everything.
Go ahead and take some, uncle.
Oh, my dear son
I want a BlackBerry phone.
We want a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project owner, my father, Bou Waleed.
*We apologize to you*
Congratulations, oh! Bou Walid
You deserve
But frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Man! There's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know about that right now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, which our ministry is seeking, please apply to obtain them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
What understands
Any contractor
The Japanese people are wonderful.
When you open it, the computer says "computer, computer, computer, computer."
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, click on "Kitchen".
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid part of the amount.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time to place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Would you like to drink some tea?
"Son, tell me, what have you done!"
You don't know Abu Fahd, he might come and he might not.
He will appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
"Come on, let's go"
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Abu Fahd's signature.
So! What should I do?
God help you.
It's a quarter to two. Oh! Bou Walid
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Bou Fahad will come.
God helps you, come tomorrow.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and that he's your friend.
What's wrong?
He is an incompetent manager.
A very stupid manager, they don't do anything.
It's a pity they appear wise in places where they aren't.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything? Not at all!
They wouldn't move a chair without Bu Fahad's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
The people's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, I hope that doesn't happen.
And if they ask about you
You're not the only one waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please take a seat.
Or go for a hike.
I'll call you when it arrives.
If anything happens, I'll call. Don't scare them.
Goodbye
Sorry for scaring you, it's my wife.
Oh my God! They've agreed to hire me two months ago.
I just need him to sign, what's this?
Oh my God! Oh, my son, it's the registration period, my daughter will lose her university scholarship, her papers need to be processed.
My problem is with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee, and when he's finished, you can come and see him.
Please, you were all asked to remain calm.
Yes, Chief
Goodbye
Wait, wait, oh people!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a private exit.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have been halted, brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What can we do, we wait for Abu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, my father.
He cannot be blamed.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
Inform him that the deadline has passed.
And your aunt is another story.
Poor thing, she lent him the money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Mom, I'm very worried about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you going to call?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
Talking about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Dad, how long do you want me to wait?
They always say,
We are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Oh! Dad, you did your best.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my dear.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Okay, who are you going to talk to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, my sister.
You were very patient with us.
God help you.
Bu Waleed is in a miserable state.
He is shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
This is because the allotted time is about to end.
There are five days left.
He will lose all his money.
God protect us.
Even better! It's drawing me in, drawing me in, drawing me in.
I wish I could improve. I feel.
I have an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
As for the other part, it is completely immovable.
Half of my body isn't working because of the fever.
This is a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps me.
We will wait until we refund her money.
May God reward her with good.
We're not worried about your sister now.
My manager, too. God help me.
It seems he heard that.
Only God knows what he is planning.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
This thing attracts me, and that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth will disappear.
Don't pull us.
Exactly in the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel sorry for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
You were a role model.
Don't think I don't know you leave work early every day.
I can deduct the amount from your salary.
What's on your phone?
Instead of deducting the amount from you
I'll put you on the stock committee.
You will go to the store with them today.
Never leave work during working hours.
If you do that.
Then don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him fidgeting with his phone, waiting for their call?
I'm afraid he'll be fired.
This is my phone, oh! Bou Walid
He is a pitiful person.
Let him go, poor thing.
Oh! Bou Walid
Yes, hello.
What's wrong with you, Abu Waleed? I'm talking to you, not the phone!
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Thank you very much.
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan located?
This is the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Or do you want
House after house
Go ahead.
Oh! Good heavens, this man has gone mad.
Do you know how much I spent?
Throughout all these years, you
He took the papers, and gave the papers back.
My knees are weak now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back just as children carry bags of chips.
After that, God willing, I learned to ride a bicycle.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They were flirting with me when I rode this bike, oh my god.
It's our daily bread, and raising our children.
The manager arrived.
We should celebrate after you're done.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
So, will you be quitting your job?
I assure you that you are already a good citizen.
I want to rest now, brother, goodbye.
We are all yours.
Don't you want us to grant you a one-year extension?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You've already given me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my sons have jobs now.
Lastly, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, oh! Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery man.
With the dawn-seekers
Do you think that
I haven't eaten a spider in four years.
How delicious!
I can smell it now.
We will do everything you want.
Take me to the HR department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm bored.
Done, finished.
Stay in touch.
My son Khalid
From this moment on,
Inshallah, I will rest. Yes.
Wonderful, wonderful
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She's inviting us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't quit his job.
What are you going to do?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him relax?
Poor him, he's happy because he'll go home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
Send him to finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the khonafrush.
Mama, it won't break.
I never regretted the khonafrush Oh! My daughter,
But I say this because he resigned from the job and left.
Khaled gave him tasks to complete.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those Lost at Sea (Singing)
Good morning, Father.
Hello, my daughter.
Daddy, please.
But they called me and said the manager was angry.
Give me your papers.
Yes, Mother of Saeed
I told you to let the kids fend for themselves. Why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
I am the poor one.
I am waiting for you with the khonafrush in front of me.
We're going to eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
God help you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I have departed, oh my daughter, I have departed.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
This is what God wanted.
It's good that you found your home.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do, Umm Saeed?
They're going through a tough time, and I need to help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I'll get you a cup of water.
And they bought a chicken to eat.
Poor thing, he's very tired.
And the taxis
He is naive.
He went to the market branch.
They want her ID card.
I took her car.
And she gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I went from one ministry to another.
I run from one ministry to another.
Finishing my children's paperwork
I took care of them when they were small, and you take care of them now, you spoil them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what can I do?
There are daily meetings, either with the manager, or with the director, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, and when they're needed, they have to be there, it's a %pw job.
While you were getting out and finishing your work, someone stopped you and made you sit the whole time. What were you thinking?
I'm coming now. May God reward you.
Coming right up, goodbye.
Sorry now, oh! oh! Bo Shahin
They called me and said it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If that's the case, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
This is impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is annoyed and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is exhausted and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering in the streets in the heat of the sun.
Let him give you the papers.
And go immediately to finish it.
A committee, starting its work from early morning until the afternoon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want the construction of my building to be delayed?
Since you have a deadline and a committee meeting tomorrow,
Your papers must be ready by tomorrow.
Some at night.
He has a meeting tomorrow, he needs to be there.
What's wrong, sir?
Where he was trying to hold back his tears.
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh! Daddy, don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those girls
I deceived him.
Okay, enough.
I will apologize.
"Rah" (This
Thank you.
Oh! Dad, Khaled is...
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he learned that the committee wouldn't come.
We are lucky to have you.
From now on, oh! Father.
We'll do our personal work ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Welcome, my son, welcome! Oh!
Good morning
Oh! Dear father
The whole world is worth it to me.
I don't want you to be sad.
And not annoyed
As I told you,
After finishing this paper
I really wanted to do that myself.
And he asked me to come at once.
Because I have a meeting.
With the happiness of the minister
It's my pleasure.
You meet important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with this one or that one.
Don't worry and go to your work, (sings)
Where is Bou Saada?
Please, Father.
The envelope is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Just drop by, I'll send it with the tea boy.
My dear father
Do you mean he didn't sign?
He may have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week's holiday and goes to the sea.
They said he enjoys his time at the farm.
Goes early in the morning.
He enjoys himself there.
And you know what?
They say he's a good cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What's the problem?
What's wrong with you, sir?
May God guide you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers to
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, remove this, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them in suspense.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it the league and the cup.
Talk about the referee of the match.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him a title, "Stop Corruption."
People started inciting him.
And they brought him some trite words to say on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Believe me or not, sister.
These days, everyone only cares about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never, ever do that.
Let him speak, and utter his famous phrase "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are lucky to have you come.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son
I was warning you.
Last night
I'd like to remind you now.
Alright, Mom.
I will never call.
No radio or TV, and I won't call Q-tell.
Your sister Aisha was
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
Please have mercy on us, may God have mercy on you.
As I said.
I'm going to stop talking nonsense.
Because I don't want you to be upset.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
They are cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he will drag you to court to divorce his daughter from you.
Alright, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do that.
Sorry, I must go now.
I'll tell you, but don't raise your voice.
The manager told me that
That's what makes you work here.
Because you might be talking about management.
And they started causing us problems.
How will the manager justify this decision?
He has a million excuses he can say.
Where am I going!
Are you serious, take the bus.
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, tell us just once, "Stop corruption."
This is wonderful
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work to do.
This is a disaster.
Until this problem is solved
What did I tell you?
I told you they would fire him.
And Munira was standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, I did it.
I heard them say it myself.
Please go, I want to talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, and we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Just because we're relatives,
Do you hear this?
Calm down.
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
May God guide you to the right path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I feel bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to you, he will take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if you leave,
Why do you want to get yourself into trouble?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the man who stops corruption?
Yes, he is a man.
It seems he's not doing well these days.
We want to hear that, just once, so let us hear it.
No, it's okay.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio show about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we spoke to him in public.
So I suggested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him privately.
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And go away.
Enough, enough, enough
I'm going to be upset and I'll never speak to you again, you hear that?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've gotten rid of this habit, praise be to God.
You have a high sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Even if I tried
Peace be upon you
We came to you, you didn't need to come.
I was about to call the secretary to inform you of your absence.
Shahin, what's the problem?
I recognized him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh Stopped Corruption?
Are you Saleh, known for fighting corruption?
Stop corruption.
Ah, the job.
There are no job openings, you know.
It's good that you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I went everywhere, Manira.
And someone even told me that there was a vacancy five minutes before I came, but they rented it out, meaning they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha divorced her husband yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I now bear a great responsibility.
I don't know what to do.
He is trying to curry favor with the minister.
But I didn't feel that this was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this man will take my place.
Enough, stop doing that.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
I'll finish it.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one who talks nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring it to your house.
And give him only the information.
You are a loyal, patriotic person.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I already left this thing.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke with him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we've heard him say, 'Stop the corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, Saleh.
I am diligent in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your wonderful words
Your words on the radio are even better.
Let's hear about stopping corruption once and for all.
Yes, please, just one, Bou Fahad will say it, listen, listen, hear him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
And then finish it.
Although I want you to continue solving people's issues and problems.
Listerine is good.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities never come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't you understand?
Please wait for my brother.
From these issues and problems
Minister's happiness
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
Those bears can withstand 120 times their body weight in pressure.
But this employee
Approving the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, brother Saleh. Stop the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear him.
The final step is to stop corruption... Stop corruption.
You know
Necessity forced him to do it.
This is the last one.
Sultan is dismissed from his position.
Did the minister dismiss him immediately?
He said that accurate information,
Now, Bu Fahd can do what he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Sure, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
The latter was certainly the case, I won't repeat it again.
And here is my job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he fears the day will come.
And expose his evil deeds.
For criticizing and exposing corruption,
They are afraid of you.
They deceived me, my sister Aisha.
You're nice.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are stupid people.
They are hateful, they despise our country.
Do we have any problems?
We don't have any connections.
I've never heard that word before.
In our government departments,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen gets? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem of which family you belong to, we don't suffer from these problems at all.
If the manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
He is free from any problems.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No candy until dinner time.
So, no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
So what tore your shirt?
May God protect you, Adoul.
Come and see what your mischievous nephew did.
I told you it was expensive and we didn't need to buy it, and you said it didn't matter, it would look nice on our son.
See what he did.
The shirt is now unusable.
That's why he's not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
See how he intended to cut him, it's clear this was deliberate.
Poor Walid
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see.
Where is the bathroom?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Have some shame.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be allowed to do as he pleases.
It is not repaired.
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a repairman?
We will raise them.
Act politely.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you arguing like children?
Stay away from this mother.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
He is a child.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
You know
This is not your fault.
Let's go upstairs.
They don't deserve it.
We're wasting our time responding to them.
One should not
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm coming, bye-bye, bye.
But sir, there are some papers that need to be signed, the minister wants to see them.
Okay, okay, I'll talk to the minister. Don't bother yourself.
Did you see the disaster, the calamity?
This is new, oh wow! Aisha
This is not an action performed by a child.
You are right.
He ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This cannot be worn.
Look at Adol's pants, they can fit one leg, and the other leg will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hand.
It appears to have been torn using a power saw.
"All I can say is that God is sufficient for us."
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come on.
I know that too.
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike,
Also because there's something else.
You're telling the truth, aren't you?
Okay, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut it?
He has a big pair of scissors that can even cut a car.
Under the bed, take all the sweets.
Not to that extent.
No one else can do something like that.
Why should we keep silent?
The most important thing
The reason is that we insist on what we say.
Who tore the clothes? Waleed is a child.
Which computer?
What's he talking about?
It's impossible for the child to have made those cracks.
Why don't you believe me?
Go and find your friends.
Give me a second.
You're always like this.
Fighting every day, oh! My son.
The past days
"I seek forgiveness from Allah and wish for good health."
May God guide you.
Who can carry such a huge pair of scissors?
Go and find friends.
A big liar, O mother.
He went and brought this big pair of scissors.
Respect yourself, Sultan, or else.
Come and find a solution to this, come my son!
How will I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Hear me and make peace with others.
Okay, tell me, what will you do now?
So what, I tore their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information. He ruined everything.
I won't let him go.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, just like that used in museums.
Ignore him.
He'll keep knocking on the door until he gets tired and leaves.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And you shook their hands.
He is full of hatred and other things.
He's angry because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahd.
Solan, hit him, hit him, hit him.
Fear God, my children!
Hit him, hit him, [shut up] be careful, [shut up]
Take your cousins and go play with them outside.
May God guide you.
May God diminish you.
Adult men,
What did you leave for the kids?
Okay, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Maybe one last time, oh! My son
You know he's the older brother, oh! Girls
He knows how to talk to people.
They discuss.
Don't be annoyed with me.
You're supposed to do
To play a role
May God guide you.
Even you have become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you're saying, %pw, stay away.
Go away.
There's blood coming from my son.
You have disappointed us, our sons!
It was the children who were throwing it.
He doesn't want to believe it.
I saw them.
We told him they were children, but he didn't believe us.
He said that from his window.
He saw children throwing stones and, because he was far away, he thought they were adults.
I am not crazy.
You can go.
You can be tired or feel dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing stones.
It seems
Oh! Dear me.
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed an undertaking. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Oh my God, oh my God.
O Allah, protect us from the evil of our enemies.
Mother, Mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they act like children, it's sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to pass out, I'm going to die.
Yes, and this isn't the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never takes his eyes off you.
He is not enrolled in the business class.
But he has been attending class with us for a week.
It's clear that he wants to get to know you very much.
Don't be like that because he loves you this much, don't be too reserved.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's leave it normal.
Now he's chasing you, dying to get to know you.
It's true that I love him too.
But I don't think this is the right time.
One hundred percent
She looks at you and*
Are you waiting for her to come up and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Initiate
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, miss.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they never recognized each other.
You are very old.
This means you have to go and say, "Excuse me,
Can I get to know you?
Not to this extent.
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, certainly.
You will never forget us.
As long as I am free.
He is buying the villa located behind our villa for Walid's father.
As for tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
No use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
May God bless their house.
Hello, hello, my son, good morning.
Clean, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is working now, come on, I'll give you a ride.
And peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
Neighbors talk to each other, what do you want?
It's best to leave us alone.
Neighbors talk to each other, outcast.
A man parked his car behind mine, and I can't get mine out.
Therefore, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic atmosphere.
See you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely, upon hearing your father's name, many people will think you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is the actor Rashid Abdullah.
Is your father Rashid Abdullah, the well-known actor?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yeah, right.
My friend at university, you know her, told me that.
He loves acting and only watches his own work.
He finally said: We live next to a famous and valuable person in the community.
My heart, what a happiness
He is very kind, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
It is said that
You know what I mean.
Do you know why I want to take pictures with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin Aboud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
You're lucky, I've brought you a lamb, a gift for your new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there any news?
In fact, we have a lot of names.
They told me: Oh! Abu Saad, may God bless you, my name is on the (list).
That will be determined according to the needs and experiences of the staff.
What we know
We may not be able to transport you.
You must excuse me, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you
We wanted to move and settle first, then when God blesses us with money, we will buy furniture.
I did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors help each other (for example)
But I heard it and saw it now.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Therefore, I'll go with you.
Do not worry, sister!
When you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan, if approved, we will change all the furniture.
And I repeat that again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like family now.
Can't your sister study without your help?
I just want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say she was my friend?
Hey boy! Hey Ali!
I have no objection to this.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I will solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
Allow me to suggest your cousin.
Leave it to me.
As you wish
They will reject you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
What's wrong with you, Bu Ali?
Oh! Brother, the car broke down.
Sometimes, this bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What's on him.
No need to trouble yourself, my brother Rashid!
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the development bank has bought you a house and a car.
This isn't our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see that relationships are evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh my God, this is a huge development.
Let's go.
Mom, this is embarrassing.
I agreed.
She said Nora was like my daughter, and the driver would take her to university every day.
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear to you, no.
She said the driver would pick her up every morning.
"By God, O Mother of Ali!"
They are kind people.
No, no, no! Oh man!
There is no initiative or power except from God.
Oh, the bother, the bother, what am I to do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who will drive my daughter to university?
Oh! Bou Ali, since Mr. Rashid Abdullah has referred you to me
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Abu Saad.
We all know how much we love Bouali.
Thank you, may God reward you, Oh! Bu Saad
They love you, God willing.
This is beautiful
Oh! People, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry Mr. Rashid, if we've wasted your time.
No problem.
You're lucky, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, I'll get it for you.
What happened, what's the problem, why are you dragging me?
You will suggest Manal to me.
They agreed on the mother, they agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Dresses too, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
I wish Waleed would get married soon too; he is the light of my eyes.
She called me, the poor thing.
She takes some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
She will also go by a fancy car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
Inshallah, I can't see you.
This is a great kindness from Waleed's mother.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I went with you like this, they wouldn't believe that this decrepit man is the husband of this queen.
Oh my God
Will you go in these clothes?
Shh! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They will be surprised, thinking I am a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may God prolong his life.
Bu Ali, by God, I didn't recognize you. I thought you were an important person, not Bu Ali. You are not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
Even your way of walking is different.
May God bless you, the people we will suggest to Ali for them.
Are they important figures?
I arranged everything from the igal (headcover) to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series I acted in.
There was an event, as I recall, a wedding ceremony.
You were wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear a bisht.
Because, God bless you, I have never worn an abaya in my life.
Inshallah, you look great.
Thus, even when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
The person who is always with me and with Khalid.
That's why.
You are my child.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to be far from us.
Nora and Walid are compatible.
He told me that he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are lucky about this matter.
I'll tell her father, and God will satisfy us with what is good.
Why did they reject him, for what reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him that Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, man!
I'm screaming from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
But I act honestly.
I act on stage for a few hours and my role is over.
When the acting is over.
You play roles.
I act.
I convey a useful vision.
Just you
I wear costumes to play roles.
On the stage
Just you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The Role of the Rich and Wealthy Woman
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed!
Lift your head up.
This is a shame.
You missed the scene.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't look back, don't look back, poor thing, you've broken my heart."
Walking straight ahead
Just like a horse.
This is Thursday, oh man, Thursday!
This is Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She feels jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he may not see women, and no woman may see him.
I saw how his wife drives him crazy.
Stand straight, don't turn your face.
I'll show it to him in the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, show them the city center view.
Thursday, show me the shape of the city center.
Don't you call this place downtown?
Let's go, Thursday
I'm going to go see what Salem wants.
Poor thing.
When will you make the change!
If you only hear what they say about you
Even my elders say more than this.
Why are you doing that?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why would you be so jealous?
When I sometimes sit in front of the TV
She, she
I swear by God.
No, no, no problem.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
Do you see that?
I spoke to her just now, right in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
What's on your mind!
There's nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're spending your time with these useless people.
Especially this fat one, he's the one I hate the most among your friends.
The person with chubby cheeks and hair like baby's breath.
This impudent person has no shame.
You want to torment me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what's wrong?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Salim, what's wrong! What happened!
Our friend Khamis has gone crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Burst out laughing
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagined his mother and pictured himself talking to her.
God protects his wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He is busy now, he has an international call, a call from very far away, so far that the call keeps cutting out.
What does the message say?
God help you, Thursday!
Why are you awake?
I can't sleep, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they were
God guide you, Thursday!
These names were selected by the Office of the Minister.
But, come on.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, then why were you eavesdropping on him!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
This way only
I saw the last number you called, read it, you have it with you.
The last number!
I dialed the last number after deleting the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name?
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salem
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, she didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call?
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, "Oh! My brother gave me the password, a pen, and told me to call. I'll give you the number."
Help each other.
You men are always like this.
You're just like him, a liar. I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
You confused me.
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is truly brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
This is my mistake, I listened to you and called her.
Listen, Thursday!
She complained about me at the minister's office.
You will come with me and tell the whole truth, get me out of this case.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He is coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting is only one hour long.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, he's been with you since that day.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his condition has not changed.
Jealous, jealous of the women around him
This is not jealousy.
He sits here alone in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Mother is dead.
That's why you called me, to find me a solution.
I asked you to move to the section where there are women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the very clear signature at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've moved to the Social Welfare Department.
Social Welfare Department! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is this considered strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you, pardon me, Mr. Khamees?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who is the person in the office with you?
Article, Saleem, Jasim
Oh! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
Therefore, I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
A problem like this
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time they transferred you because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what can be done!
Not talking when your wife calls you.
You never know, they might obey you if you beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I had put them in the box for you.
How many?
I put ten because there are five of you in the office, which means two each.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine if he gave all of us male names.
And he calls me Abdul Qadir.
What's his name?
He is kind and handsome, and that's why she's afraid another woman might love him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with it?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
These are the abayas; each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this.
How much is this?
What's the problem? What happened?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office located?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I am crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
You presented the project to us.
And he met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Manor, prepare some tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, go make us some tea.
Go, go, this is nonsense.
Go, listen to what the men say.
Don't forget that we are the Scorpion clan.
Go, go, bring me tea without sugar, go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project was fine.
I called him several times, but his phone was busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you for a while.
These are my brothers as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled three months ago, and hasn't shown up yet.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yes, but if you build a garden
That will take up the space of at least one, if not two, villas.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea down and leave.
There is no garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and your brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, do you want to commit suicide?
Saw, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessing.
Oh, Uncle Shahin is here.
Inshallah
Is this Thursday?
Grew up
He has become an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, may you live long.
Set it aside.
I have some remarks on his suggestions.
Okay, may God grant you a long life.
Anything else?
No, I wish God grants you a long life.
Take care of them, and I'll meet them when I find the time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's the problem?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
And we suffered from them.
Did you know they asked me about the game you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
This was just the beginning.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what that means?
This time we smashed your face.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Uncle, let me slap her in the face.
This was enough.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted to study architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You're going to embarrass us.
Let me break her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Sure, the scorpion king.
I had just defeated Fatoum.
Let your brother have his chance, Falcon.
This is a shame.
No problem, Darking. At least you got a slap in the face.
Show my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk, in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't utter a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And write education instead.
Or even nursing, we don't mind.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go far away.
Bring us a copy of the request.
Go, go away
Leader of the Scorpions, my son!
It was the big spider himself who suggested you.
Thank you, Uncle, but when will the engagement be?
Miss Munira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Abu Khalid
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
This is difficult.
Think again.
Don't make a decision now, think about it until tomorrow.
How could they let you work!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask someone to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is nonsense.
No shame!
You should be grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and keep silent.
Thursday is the son of scorpions.
He is our relative.
True, he is stupid and doesn't have a degree.
But it's a scorpion.
What are you going to do, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can she do?
The engagement will be next Monday.
I'll call you to come according to the time the sheikh will arrive.
A very beautiful laugh
Go buy yourself new clothes.
Go and get yourself some new clothes, my son!
I love this laugh.
Brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
You're lucky, Aisha. You've become the minister's friend!
I'm afraid this is a rumor. Oh! Bou Khaled
Manira has been nominated to be a minister in a new ministry in the new cabinet structure.
Munaira deserves the very best.
I hope this is not just a rumor.
Will you go to work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
Through each one of our efforts in our places, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
Thank you = Happiness
Thank you.
Welcome, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, my brothers!
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good offensive player.
She is going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister will play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a request to transfer her.
You will study architecture.
There is no difference between man and woman.
Really? Go and bring coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, say hello to your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go, *
How stupid he is!
The coffee in the pot you have has gone cold.
They call all year round, but when they know you have a series, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the children!
What did you tell her?
I told her you'd be with us in the series.
Sure, and she'll be the main character.
Look, Ali, Sha'ula is going to play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, it can make her look younger.
Mary's role is only for twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes.
Let Saul benefit.
He's going to give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid he'll be a nuisance to us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the production company is yours and Hamed's.
I hope I'm not late.
Rashid is here too.
The director and actors are ready.
To save time, let's start the meeting, people!
Please let us know your opinion.
Hamed, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
Do you remember when the maid committed suicide?
You know the most impactful part for me.
That was when the maid committed suicide.
When she hung herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
She found him and cried over her son, it was touching.
And he kept kicking her until he reached the yard of the house.
Is it excitement?
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
This is a really great series.
I was about to perform the series here on this table.
It's really an extortion of the artistic conscience.
My community
It's all about extraordinary events.
That which is unbelievable.
Seventy-two murders
Why are you crying?
You are known for obstructing people.
Alright, Mr. Hamed, let's be open.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, for it avails nothing in the critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
He was an Indian carrying a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hessa?" and I replied, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, it wasn't a mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I never dreamed of owning a ring like this.
God bless you, my dear sense!
Yes, that's it, I call it the "Series of Blessings."
Ali and Hamed own the production, but they are employed there and cannot present it under their names.
What else will we take besides the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your wonderful husband
Who is known as the Magician?
Only five percent, that's a small amount.
No, that's good, they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will get two hundred thousand riyals, that's good.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nadia.
This is a great role, she falls in love with a man and escapes on a bicycle.
The series we will produce is called Blackmail of Conscience.
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know,
Gulf soap operas are always like this; the trend this year is blackmail.
Well, tell my courage, what's my role?
And you too, my love, your place is secured.
Don't embarrass me.
I'm coming, I'm coming, now.
I did all this work, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
May God protect us.
He never asked to see me at this time of day.
She told him that the series would be weak and silly.
Don't waste your money on him.
Well, then, what happened next?
God protect me, what can I say, I'm afraid Rashid said something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
It's a social series.
I just saw him on TV.
No, may God grant you a long life.
The series that is currently airing on television is called "Blackmail of a Little Flower."
But I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
This requires a high budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We must support him.
What's on him.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they'll start filming the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
And that there is a huge budget allocated for that.
But, it is said that the series is weak.
Others said the series consisted of a school teaching corruption.
It's possible they'll stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Welcome. Hello, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I am Eli Monir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Okay, sure, please take a seat for a moment because there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will be reaching out to all journalists around the world to connect with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
Discusses its issues in a way that makes it the best production in the history of the world.
Do you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a moral sense.
They work.
Do you think they are here for*
I met the happy minister, do you know what he told me?
It's very tragic and the events are extraordinary.
The first episode will be tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mother?
It's okay, Mom, this is just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Also, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your series?
Oh! My son, art is taste, not unusual states that you generalize about people and society.
Mom, this is possible in visual arts, but drama is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our kids see this.
Not to that extent, brother.
There are worse shows on TV.
In fact, not anyone.
This is your mistake.
For every person, in every home.
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And they were informed about it for their sake.
It is not for us.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How can the minister love that?
Well, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that.
I only post messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish letters of praise from me, and I will say that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You will be happy.
For this year
Well, if they had an agreement with him.
This is the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Well, let's assume they all agreed with them.
I will only read the subtitled version.
I wish they would rerun the series Extortion of Conscience.
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I wish they would air it again.
When the minister's office first called me
That we can come to pick up the final installment of the serial money.
They were right to call you the wizard.
That wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding, and we took our money.
The series is also considered a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose a second season of the series.
The minister believed that the journalistic stunt I pulled was a trick.
He believed in the illusory success we achieved.
He is not satisfied with the series.
This means it's impossible for him to agree to a second term.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can only
Say "thank you"
For all people
Who worked on this series?
And congratulate them on his success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning these awards at prominent festivals is amazing.
Proves that there is
This is what you believe.
You are a wonderful person.
You will surely win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said that if readers and the press lie to me,
Yeah, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are a whitewash of art.
Wash the artworks!
I've heard about money laundering.
It is not art.
Illegal money
The series are the same.
What can we do with "one two"?
What do you mean?
Haven't we signed a contract with them? They should abide by it.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread of all kinds and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and diverse.
How much did we agree on the amount in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do to the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone told you about his product?
No, not really, they just told me it was bread, but I don't know what's in it.
This is a zipper bread.
You call it "Soustha"
Instead of slicing bread, there's semolina bread, as you call it.
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Genise bread
This is the secret.
You eat bread with a zipper.
These people do very strange things.
The zipper is amazing, it's made in a way that it melts as soon as you put it in your mouth.
It can have different flavors, such as strawberry, ketchup, and coffee.
Do you know how much money I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
"Please! Oh, forgive me."
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Tell him: Oh! Forgive me.
I was with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football with his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men
It's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, and if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When I took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
Important people in the company
Indispensable ones
The hospital's pastry shop was taken.
Why are you upsetting the man?
I said he couldn't, being from a well-known family, he can't go chasing after a ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do what he wants.
Just don't take the necessary things.
What can I do, Mom? My team has a match and we need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, what's done is done, no matter what happened.
Mr. Hamdy didn't come to work today.
I went with him.
Put on your clothes.
They used to ask me to stand in the goal area.
The match started.
After that, I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I wasn't paying attention.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to play.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, oh! Nasser
No football.
You need to disband your team.
All bakers should return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, it is
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, oh! Bou Nasser
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, I'll do that, just because you asked me to.
Speak, what did you want to say?
We'll play the last match of the tournament tomorrow.
Don't upset him, oh! Ya Bu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Okay, oh! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Good, good, good, congratulations.
Oh! Mr. Nasser, I want to speak with you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we must
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
And we invite the press and journalists to come there.
No way! Rashid, we'll do that at our place.
Even when my father sees the players and their success, that might not cancel it out.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and talking to the press with them.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Keep him close to me.
Take a good picture.
He is happy.
Your comment on your baker sons' victory made them...
Fun
And the effort exerted
Loyalty to the bakery.
Sorry, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing in a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
God have mercy on you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
Journalists from The League and The Cup will come to interview you.
No, they are not from the National Assembly.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Insha'Allah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers. You're lucky with this football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He said he would agree to a reduction in the price of engines.
Yes, indeed, you've become famous now. Under every picture of you in the newspapers, they write: "The first athlete in the international bakeries."
Why wasn't I interested in soccer?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The person who was sitting next to me loves football.
She says I wasn't close to soccer.
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Being close to sports means I'm an athlete.
That's why we are no longer international bakers, but international footballers.
I heard him say yesterday that he would turn it into a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete in the International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before you go on stage.
The game is difficult today.
The team that will control the midfield today will be the winner.
Yes, if God wills, we are in contact with professional player agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud, listen, we want a commitment.
(Ah, he wants the previous deal for the players)
That was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I have given you the international price.
So, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
All you have to do is let me know when a buyer from the Gulf comes once.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a forward.
Look, these four players
The cost of three of them.
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one bundle.
This will be six hundred thousand, I'll give them to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Sweet, this is for African players, but for the Brazilian player, it's different now.
He's the player of the season, he alone is worth a million and two thousand dollars.
They quoted this price, but then I received a fax, I'll show it to you, it's right here. Wait, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, I'll examine his leg muscle.
How are you?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to get injured, hopefully there's no cruciate ligament damage.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this connecting muscle?
Oh butcher! Make a traditional dish of rice and meat (muffatah).
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, the store.
Oh, God willing, you have another business.
No, no, no, only players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the African forests.
Yeah, why this?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being just like her.
He said he was young, didn't you hear him?
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, he will be beneficial to you later.
And then they go and show it to him in the stadium.
Come, come, come, come
Be nice to him, he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer must understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
My father, he is Spain's coach.
What I love
Successful coach
The game must be controlled.
And this is the reverse, the Al Wakrah road.
We shouldn't let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We must put an end to this matter.
If he were an expert in soccer, he would have utilized the wing players and not attacked from the center.
Yes, he relied on the offside trap.
Oh, Mom, don't give me a headache.
He must fire Kakuno Malalawi.
And replace it with Shinamo Hababo Hitawala Hatawa Hawawa
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget Shouloulou Habobo Tabo Lava
What line?
Implementing the plan
And forget about him.
This shouldn't happen between the coach and the team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery van, let him go by taxi.
Mind your own business.
Stay informed.
Do you think what my father did was fair?
He fired the coach and sent him back to his home country.
What's he doing?
The team is destroying.
Our team said goodbye.
Mama Mama
No, he's crazy. That means he told you you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this person.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talking about the past.
You must go to his father and find out why your daughter was divorced.
I don't know what to say, oh! Brother Rashid.
So why did he divorce her then?
This isn't fair, Abu Abdullah! We need to know, it's our right to know, why is she divorced?
Please, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
How can I interfere? The man is sitting in the living room waiting to find out why his daughter is divorced?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
This is not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not a woman.
This is Guardiola's team.
This means that I will now go to the man who is waiting for me in the living room.
If I go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
She has to go out, don't shake your head.
It was not enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your impudent daughter is making fun of him. Listen,
Your daughter is not a Barcelona fan and she is not suitable for us (like).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
To apologize and to please her.
God's curse.
And we praise God that we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if we can't make our son happy?
Oh, stop it.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not mad.
She's crazy. Oh! Son, forget about her.
Drink your tea, my son!
Do you know, my son! They are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I pity her.
Poor thing, she got divorced two days ago.
After a marriage that lasted one month.
What's wrong with you? Do you want me to deal with him?
I don't want to get into trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories?
Don't listen to her.
She knows who he is.
What more do you want!
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and convert into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura.
This building belongs to his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't do that.
Talk to her brother.
Listen well,
A son of one of the millionaires proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain, so they can spend every summer there.
Okay, what's the story with Barcelona?
The girl's family could have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's assume the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is a supporter of Catalonia.
He is supposed to respect his wife.
Do not mock the team.
And that's assuming this story is true.
God bless you, his Highness' father is called Abu Burgin because he had two towers on the corniche.
Designed in a strange way resembling twisted ropes.
When people see them from a distance, they think they see one tower.
What do you think? All the luck is on your side.
Hello
God bless you. Take something, and have something to eat.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me that the light of my eyes, my son Abdullah, awaits your reply.
No, don't worry, O my eye's light, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched all the Gulf countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
I'm finished, Your Excellency. Is there anything else?
Yes, the family will call you.
"Figure out their wedding needs, prepare the check, and I'll sign it."
In the name of God, God has willed it, in the name of God, God has willed it, with your permission, Your Excellency the President.
Abdullah divorced his wife again!
I wish the children were from you and the wealth from him.
God bless you, auntie!
Wear it to protect yourself from the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, Mother?
My mother says she booked us tickets to Malaysia.
What is Malaysia's problem, alright?
A pleasant trip.
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong with you, my daughter, tell me, oh!
Tell me what happened, my daughter! Oh!
Mom, she's very arrogant.
Why this?
She's arrogant, forget about her.
You did the right thing when you fired her.
I pity her.
This is her mother.
Why is she upset?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Alright.
My mother says she booked us a trip to the Maldives.
Alright, alright, oh! The daughter of the Maldives is beautiful too.
It also entertains you.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really gets on my nerves is why did they take the children?
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you angry, my dear?
Shut up! May God give you health, you'll tell me about my son's face.
Oh! My son! Why are you upset?
When I see the shells, I'll feel disappointed.
Let him who bothers you (like) Oh, what a son!
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Shut up, and I know my son, anything small bothers him, why should he live miserably!
Oh my God! Son, call her and divorce her.
God damn her.
Say it to her three times: %pw.
You're divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, you have two more tries.
Divorced, divorced.
%pw is a very nervous person.
Oh! My son, go. Oh! My dear, relax and don't worry, there are many girls, as they say, go. Oh! My son.
Oh, there's a problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
What's my mother's name? He divorced me, he said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you? He has no dignity.
And now if a woman goes to a disco, what will she do!
And one of them, if necessary %pw.
What's wrong?! What's happened to the world that it's turned upside down?!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and humiliate him, and he won't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced, O Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
Just as you now feel the bad taste in your mouth because of your daughter and feel frustrated.
And they did nothing.
If she doesn't bring you the apple peeled, divorce her.
You can divorce them however you want, it's acceptable.
She is still married to a man.
Is this suitable for you, let him go to hell!
I feel the same way that others felt because of what I did to them.
What you do not accept for yourselves.
Don't accept it from people.
Do you know who owned the land of this mall previously?
Is it in a strategic location?
Leave it to God alone.
And also at a low price.
Out of scope.
I must get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm out of office and the problem is that I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, I have to.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is an official matter.
The right place for that, may God protect you, is the office, not the home.
Do you eat as well?
What will make this Abu Sakr full?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd!
Do you know him?
As far as I know, I only see him on TV, and you told me you meet him during the Hajj pilgrimage.
But we don't know each other well.
Don't chatter too much.
Guided by God, I came immediately. At least ask about the reason for this celebration.
There's no reason for that, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he holds fifty feasts.
I suggest, sir, that you be put in the Guinness Book of Records.
As the world's biggest party maker.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Welcome, this is a blessed time.
It's a great honor, Your Honor.
So, Abu Falah!
You say Abu Sakr throws a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But oh! Abu Falah, tonight's feast is for a special occasion.
Today, may God protect you and your son, Falcon.
God willed it, and he deserves it, O man of honor, with blessings.
He's here, welcome, son! Oh!
Peace be upon you.
For what?
On this occasion, my son Saqr must go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I had been waiting for a year and a half to get the approval.
I was out of range.
But when I got to him
And give him the money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things won't go this way.
I told him I agree.
He has to go to the showroom and choose the car he likes.
We will buy three for him.
Take him to him!
They took me to him.
You told me that you met him during the Umrah last year.
His young son Shahin today.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by him and congratulated him.
"He deserves to be well, oh! My lord judge."
Shahin Oh! Abu Sakkar.
May God bless you, thank you, people!
Praise be to God that Shahin is fine, my lord.
God bless you
By the way, who are you?
My lord, the judge.
You didn't introduce yourself.
I can't lie to you.
Sir, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
To be honored by your presence.
So, Falcon, are you still undecided about entering the business field, or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
Why, son of Falcon Oh! Trade is good.
You have to start, open an office and then see.
Abu Sakr,
Your Honor, please say yes.
For what?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
And if the merchants love you and come to you, you will say no.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Since you got your license, everything has come easily to you: a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz was telling your father that if he decides to join the business, he will make him a partner with a 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mom, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky because agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
It's an opportunity, my God! Which son can start a business at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, [my son], this is the opportunity of your life.
Rose quickly prepared lunch.
He also reached the pickles and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa business.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was looking forward to seeing. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands located there.
May God protect him from the eyes of the envious.
Sultan's father told me yesterday that your son has just entered the business field.
He has twenty agencies and six restaurants, and he is a shareholder in two banks.
**T
I believe, Allah knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, the one in the northern area of our office, what's in it?
No, but I love him.
Thank you and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
May God bless you all.
There's no use regretting now.
"What are you saying, man! A whole year of suffering and hard work to prepare for the supermarket."
What's the problem! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He watched and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me this is Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, who wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Does he also want to be your partner?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
You started talking to him, didn't you?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I told you work!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What was the name written on the sign?
It said "The Neighborhood Bakery" on it.
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
So, how are things going with you at work?
Good morning, Sir. We hope to finish the drawings for the Future Company's worker housing by tomorrow or the day after.
No, no Mr. Sakr, she is my wife Elisa, let me introduce you to Mr. Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, someone said I want to work in business, he has some money and wants to invest it.
But he lacks sufficient knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
A person like this
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Did you hear that, Abu Nasser? Oh!
Did you hear what these two parrots are saying?
What is this?
You took my son, Falcon.
Look at him.
Look at him today.
Your Honor, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the law.
Your son, Saghier, God willing, and I don't want to envy him, is an exceptional case.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, my son Falcon is building himself.
He once gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And whatever God wants, look at it now.
Oh! Falcon, we're talking about ordinary people.
One of them is a falcon, and that's what Abu Nasser did with him; he took him and put him on the road.
Saker has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We must ask who his father is.
I swear to God that I am amazed.
What God wants.
Gulf Funds Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Please come in.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong?
I swear to God, I don't know what to say, oh! Salim.
Yes, I remember that.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
Poor thing, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office and the fax was in his hand.
And he had done him many a good turn.
As they say, "I taught him archery, and when his arm grew strong, he shot me with an arrow" (proverb).
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, Salim!
I'm stunned.
I can't believe there are people like this in the world.
A man who gives to the poor without letting his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are delivered to all Muslims across Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Lastly, but not least, we are now supporting seven poor families as well.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
Then we'll come to you right away.
Who is this cutie?
This is Khalid and his wife; we invited them tonight at the hotel.
Yes, anywhere, anywhere, you and I together, I'm happy.
My love, may God keep you for me.
Oh! My darling.
This is not fair. This is my source of income.
This bakery
And take the money for the interest you have.
Five riyals for falafel, three riyals for hot bread.
Two chickpeas.
Five broad beans, perfect, perfect.
Cook six beans!
Come on, divers, oh!
The captain is here and has brought breakfast.
He needs men.
Please, sir!
So what?
No, no, what I'm asking you for is that I want to hear the word "yes" ringing in my ears.
Hello, Nora.
Anoud is mad at you.
Can I bear your anger?
So what's the problem?
Why are you upset?
Nora chose a simple, unadorned dress.
Don't say Anoud will get upset.
Good heavens, Lebanese people speak so well.
You shouldn't talk to him too much.
Me too, I'm jealous of her.
The best dress for the most beautiful flower.
He flirts with her by calling her "Noor".
Let your blood boil, how long will that take?
I paid twenty thousand riyals and twenty thousand riyals remain.
"Hopefully you will be compensated (like this), congratulations!"
God be with you.
Hello, you are Mrs. Saleh's daughter-in-law.
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to keep you.
At your service (expression).
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I got it, oh! You fool.
Did you like the joke?
So, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them. Show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
They will leave us, and jealousy will start to work.
When he realizes that my project is good and starts generating income,
They say he will work on a project similar to mine.
A design and tailoring shop
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser, who has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He will hurt his cousin.
That's the way it is these days.
Yes, yes, my cousin.
Did you know that I was sleeping and woke up when they told me your cousin wanted me?
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like
Are you coming to look for a partner or something like that?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I'd drop by.
You are most welcome.
If you need a salary increase, we will provide it for you.
Praise be to God, the work is going well.
What am I going to do, Abu Saleh!
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did that.
Okay, this is good, God willing, goodbye.
So, this is it.
Are you sure?
And with haute couture, do you know what the greatest catastrophe is!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are jealous. (Ad) You are full of hatred!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You must know.
You must open your heart to your cousin.
I'm not here to ask you.
You deny, lie, and mock me, and you said to me, to me,
I wanted to do my work in secret.
You want to take that shop next door, and you want to put me out of business.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to a wisdom tooth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. I swear to God, I'll slap you. This is hatred. Leave me alone.
Come on, you're family, folks! Oh!
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave me alone, I swear I'll hit you! With your annoying voice, you.
I'll hit you just as you hit me and stole my share.
Come on, people!
Just say "peace be upon him," people!
I swear to God, I swear to God, you didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why Lebanese specifically?
They talk to him in casual conversations, joke, laugh, and feel completely comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh brought in a Lebanese person.
He started saying some nice words to me and trying to convince me.
He impressed me, he impressed me with his words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, similar to the one for nine hundred riyals.
And earn money.
Bring in a Lebanese designer.
Can I speak to the gentleman? Yesterday you told me it was difficult, and today it's difficult too?
Yeah, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong?
No, I don't know. What's the problem?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a store and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been continuously declining.
This is the problem we have in Qatar. No Qatari opens a shop without another Qatari coming and doing the same project and opening the same shop next to him. Can I enter it?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now and they're thinking of a solution.
What should we do now?
We sit as if we had eaten poison.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even be able to pay the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we'll be giving them a free rein.
Okay, thank you, and what is the discount percentage?
Impossible, why don't you give a free evening gown with every wedding dress?
Impossible, let's go.
What's the problem? What happened? We're going to the store next to you; today they put up an ad that with every wedding dress, you get two evening dresses for free, and also a 25% discount.
Alright, let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will publish the same ad, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing. If we leave them, they'll destroy us.
Don't bother.
What did he do next?
Therefore, it's definitely a challenge.
This is a challenge, of course.
Bravo, this naughty boy deserves it, he doesn't want anyone to earn a living.
If that happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days, I'll close his shop.
Well done.
Wait, wait, hang up, hang up, I'm coming to you now, bye.
What's the problem?
Saud says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit in it, and he says he doesn't know where this bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, impossible.
Its smell will linger in the shop for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He is cutting the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now will you sign an undertaking or shall we file a lawsuit and open a case?
Don't do anything for him.
I'm going to end his life.
Oh! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, hang up, hang up, there's a customer coming, I'll call you later. This is strange.
He's in bed, moaning.
He says it's a mental condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and they need the installments.
He was burdened with debts because of his miserly cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor them, if they enter by mistake and see Saad the designer, they scream at him and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never sleeps, his eyes are open and he stares at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saad is present in the shop.
He bewitched him; I don't know what he did to him.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, what made him become like this!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll put me in prison.
And I have no evidence against him, so I can't sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget him, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you've worked on him. You've turned his designer into a monster and women are afraid when they see him.
I spread a rumor.
This isn't right oh! People, tell him the shooting team needs him urgently.
Oh! People, may God bless you, may He protect you. Tell him they urgently, urgently need you.
I swear to God they will raise my blood pressure, they will kill me, they will paralyze me. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
No problem, dear Ahmed. Don't get angry. You have heart disease; this is not good for you, man!
I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but it's no use. These secondary actors are going to drive me crazy, they're going to drive me crazy.
You're not doing anything, I'm in charge of everything!
Listen to me, I'll teach you a harsh lesson.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed, we want to finish.
Therefore, I'll stop filming because the extra actor didn't show up.
What is this production?
I have nothing to do with this thing. Oh! Mr. Abdullah, why is he shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
The extra actor was late and they were in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone who has a prestigious status and is able to convince people that he can really be a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come inside and order what you want, and your order will be ready in half an hour.
Not just anyone, oh! Ala'a, not just anyone, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll manage with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager, you are responsible.
What's he going to do now?
They'll do whatever it takes, see that the manager is stressed and the situation is chaotic, but they'll handle it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find such a person now?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, God help you with him, I hope he's suitable.
%PW Saudi with a lot of money!
Saud Kan! I remember him as Saud al-Bakthouni.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud al-Bukhtur, and when he grew up, they called him Kanz.
Why the cans?
I'll tell you why. Poor guy, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
Oh! My rich and distinguished brother, no to despair.
His appearance is suitable, what I remember is that he is stocky and chubby, not tall and not fat.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
God willing, but you have to do nice makeup for him, and I guarantee he will be suitable and he is also a funny person.
Okay, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and I'll go to him.
Where is Saud Kans's house located?
What's he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saudi cans
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kansa.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's right.
But this is not Saud Kansa.
This is Saud's laptop.
Sure, this is it, but it evolves over time because the laptop is like a can.
He is tall and fat with a slightly brown skin.
He canceled the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on Oh! Man
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where's the second Goth, where is he?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks Vaporub and Axe Brand.
Iron it a bit before you go out, because it's wrinkled.
But I've been feeling worse lately.
Mom, God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting on taking you to the emergency room, I want to take you there, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they said they would pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you are working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You'll argue with her, you'll get angry, and you'll go upstairs.
You sit and move slowly, slowly, and the camera moves with you, and it will move beside you.
Yes. Ja'far! Yes.
Whose laptop is this?
Any Aboud, this is a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Lamie.
This is for you, but for me, he is the son of a bitch, Aboud, how are you?
How are you, O slave?
Act politely, you should behave politely in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, I wish they'd give me a role where I can slap you.
It's not as you know, my brother!
She is very sick, do you know she didn't sleep last night? Oh! Brother!
Asthma, oh! May God heal my brother.
May God heal her.
Your life is but a bowl of cherries (proverb).
Oh! My lord, oh! My lord.
Does he have medicine for my mother's asthma?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourselves, listen to what he's saying, he has no point.
What is his mother's name?
Spit on you, what do you think?
Did you hear what she said about you?
She says you're a shallow person and you should be more balanced.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix my broken car tires.
I'll give him three million to get me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm awake at the request of some people.
Watch Mr. Ghafel, a production of our neighborhood, high-level actors.
Now he's excellent, he's suitable for this role.
Excellent, I'll help you, I have no feeling, I don't have any, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is but a bowl of cherries (proverb).
Take the man to the makeup room, do his makeup, and I'll ask Salman to bring you the clothes and come to you.
Go, go, go, this is great.
Alright, alright.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
That's fine, but is there anyone who can give me a lift?
I'll give you a ride! No problem, I'll ask our driver to take you. Okay, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Alright, call your friend, call the extra actor, call him.
Oh! People are calling for Saud's laptop from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth then.
It's already written in front of me.
Alright, do we want to review?
This means me!
I didn't expect this from you.
We will fight, but for what!
We will fight for our rights.
Yeah, wait.
You should know who you're talking to, Abu Abdelaziz.
Why did he divorce her? Oh, brother!
Divorce her and be done with it.
We don't marry the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He will clean it, but later. The most important thing is for you to get ready because you're going to go into the dressing room to change your clothes and we're ready to shoot.
My teeth, the toothpaste is expensive.
Oh! Guys, the shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why this?
I don't need tea. Oh! Brother, I'm bored and my stomach is bloated from tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how long do I have to wait?
"I didn't see anything, it's quite normal."
God give you health.
They are fast.
Thank you, Your Honor, may God protect you.
Give my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdelaziz sends his regards.
Alright, Your Honor %PW.
That was fun, wasn't it?
No one is like you, they greet you and kiss your nose too.
The first time someone kissed me on my nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream cone, it cuts your lips. That was funny, that was funny.
I didn't laugh!
No problem.
Can I become an actor?
Is there any problem? What's wrong with your voice?
My son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
May God bless you, Sheikh, may He bless you.
Look here or there for yourself, man!
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened? Oh my son!
Peace be upon you, what has happened to you, sir?
Let, let, let, let
Don't worry, God willing it will be, Oh! Dr. Hassan come here, come here.
Yes, oh! Dr. Hany, what happened?
Leave your honor at the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, and God willing, she will be fine.
Welcome, welcome, welcome, my lord, welcome.
Shut up or I'll slap your face.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Call me, sir, oh!
How are you, sir?
God damn you (expression).
Yes, Your Honor.
Hello! Oh, please have a seat, sir.
God bless you.
With this ugly face (proverb).
Go with him, oh! Mr. Rashid.
I swear to God, if you don't do something for me, tell me, and you'll see what I'll do to him.
Oh! My friend, can I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, your turn will come.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, friend?
Oh! Son, quickly, I'm sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, taking your mother every week, and haven't found any of them to be bad or unwilling to accept anything.
Unlike citizens.
And do not forget the female citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
But oh! She's ignoring me, brother.
Alright, so try to be close to her, laugh with her, look at her, give her your number with good intentions.
There's nothing, no mistake at all.
Act politely.
Or get out, get out, if you don't leave I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, no, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
Please, for me.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Falih Al-Marzook.
Marrying him means you will marry him.
No, no, I need the money, clothes, and the car too. I'll rent them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What is this %PW in the context of Fahad Marzouq!
Welcome, welcome, you are very welcome.
The light of my eyes signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what I did for them; it was a very elegant and unique party.
One is regular, the other is diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom, I promised my friends I'd go to work tomorrow.
Will you carry this for them?
Yeah, what's the problem with it?
Nora, come here!
What is this?
He will take this thing to his friends, for the scandal.
Don't even think about taking it, it will make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, and tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yeah, but I promised them now.
I have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can bring something that pleases people.
What's wrong! Let's go.
Its price is reasonable and it's very high quality.
Above average, but not the best!
Of course there's premium chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for something more affordable.
This is too expensive. Why do you look for the most expensive things?
This is incredible, look at this artistic touch.
This chocolate is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always ordered at the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, the product comes with a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother!
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the person in charge of accounts.
By God, he deserves it, give me another one.
Bring the coffee quickly.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, dear, I attended their wedding. It was embarrassing and disgusting. Can you believe it, sister!
Did you listen to your aunts?
That's why I want to throw you an unforgettable wedding party.
There's no time, you only have a month and a half.
I'll arrange everything.
But he doesn't allow me to do anything.
You don't live in the community, and you don't see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw that for yourself.
When you bought something beautiful, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
They told you it's amazing and wonderful?
That's true, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate, we could have bought four sheep for the wedding with it.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
This means they will agree to anything we choose.
Ugh, your taste is really terrible.
What's your opinion on this stage?
But excellence requires a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous version was good!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought about creating a platform similar to a computer mouse.
Excuse me for a minute.
Look, they talk about everything except the stage and the arrangements. This is where the women who have nothing but gossip will stay, so just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We will move on to the mouse stage.
It's a very strange phase.
The latest model in two thousand and eleven.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit this one out, it's all for your own good.
Therefore, you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you'll pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Decided and we are ready.
You're not the first person to get married.
What do you think, will you get married in the Comoros? That's how things are going in our country.
We're still only at the beginning.
If you don't have a platform, where will you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some woods.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; they are actually con artists.
So what's your problem now?
Are you angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I'll call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is going through very difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding expenses? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you place them on the tables at the wedding reception,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East!
Add it to the bill.
How much will this increase?
One hundred seventy-two, alright then,
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's gossip.
Alright, it's booked.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle will start.
God help you, Saleh!
But you, God guide you, should have tried to sort things out.
For me, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say that getting married there only costs you two thousand dollars, and you can enjoy yourself.
God bless you, my dear.
If God wills, his wedding will be next month.
You just need to specify the number of cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about him, and you don't care what people will say.
People know the wedding ceremony standards through the invitations.
I know what the ladies will say tomorrow when they see these invitations.
Look at their wedding over there. If these are their invitation cards, they haven't seen so-and-so's invitation card.
We said we'd order it online.
He has a cloth cover, made of panda skin, with a silver sheen.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be a hot topic for the ladies, we'll be begging for invitations, meaning we'll be begging for invitations!
I pity him, man!
Poor thing, of course his family put a lot of pressure on him.
Goodness! He's a man begging for money from everyone.
What do you say? He even sold his car.
He looks twenty years older than his age, for I saw him this morning talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, poor thing, I don't know when we'll evolve.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, oh! Brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding according to your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why, do I live alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the illness of appearances, boasting, and showing off.
So he forces you to catch the same disease.
If you want to live in it.
Once, I caught a glimpse of the bride's mother.
She was attacked for her words (proverbs).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me.
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you, my brother, decide that I should get married, oh!
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so angry?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every day one of his friends takes him in his car.
I entered the room earlier and found him talking to himself.
I see, you've changed your mind now.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, please stop, Mom.
I don't care about you or him.
I am no less than people.
Don't make a mockery of us.
Please, Mother, enough! My brother has spent everything he has and taken money from everyone.
Please be quiet.
My mother has new demands for the marriage, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so I screamed at him and said I'll cancel the marriage, I don't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She's inside and they're giving her first aid.
He said she was now much better and that they would find her a room in the hospital.
What a scandal!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to make a joke out of good and evil?
I was telling him to buy Abdullah Roaished, and he said he didn't have any money.
I pity your mother.
Be worried about her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her that I will do what she wants,
I'll get you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is a kind person, I don't think he won't help me.
This is not fair, you couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's wrong with him!
Are you crazy, Saleh? Oh!
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and more importantly, he was disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did that.
This is due to the financial crisis you are going through, and you want to ask Abu Yusuf for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
Only God knows when He will bring him back to Him.
And when the auditors come and ask him about the money,
He may well be in trouble.
No one will know, and he will know how to handle the situation.
It's up to you, the man is in his office and you must be responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
Uncle, they call this theft.
On the first floor.
In it, there is a white box wrapped in a blue ribbon with a circle containing a picture of a dove's wing on it. Bring it, bring it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me, if I don't have any problems.
I'll give back all the money.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And I came in my last days.
Corrupt me, O Thursday, what a thing!
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying. If it was someone else, they would have been beaten or something bad would have happened to them. Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
Every way I've tried hasn't worked, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm stuck.
I can't back out of the marriage and change my mind.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong?
No, no, the other one, the panic pill, the panic pill.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Yusuf, the stairs are full of tablets, which one do you want?
The box with the picture of the scared and terrified man on it.
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
We'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Roaished and his band.
You'll see, my love.
No, I won't tell you.
Will this be the hit of the season?
We are the first people to use it in the world.
Mom, mom,
Bye bye.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the Mu'awwadhats when you enter the dance hall.
The women here have evil looks.
I've already told you it's great.
The best groom ever, God bless you, I don't want to envy you.
Mama, mama, the police are knocking on the door.
I erred when I obeyed you, O God.
This is not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people who will conduct the test have come.
And now solve it, I'll be imprisoned, oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a three-million-dollar contract, two million of which was just for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but the corruption does not go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
Why didn't our president object? They say he was with him!
I don't know anything about it, I swear I don't.
Where is morality?
Truth has become falsehood and falsehood has become truth!
Oh! Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Oh! Goodness, what's happening to the world?
All they did was fire him!
What else?
It belongs to the minister's sister.
This girl is involved with the minister.
How strange this world is (proverb).
What's wrong with you guys, don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee whom the minister hired instead of poor Uthman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh?! I object to the minister!
Are you crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
There he is standing by the elevator.
This is the reward of loyalty and honesty, my brother Saleh!
I wish we could do something for you, brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh? Oh!
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We're witnessing unbelievable things.
I'm at your disposal.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work to pick up some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, okay bye.
Who's taking my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and chattering. Who was she?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he gives me a ride home? There's nothing wrong with that.
Oh my god, I can't believe it, why do you look so outdated!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You're a traditional person.
This is an old and new matter concerning right and wrong!
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The age of international variables that unite the world and no one can keep up with.
The more I live, the more I see!
Don't blame me, Manira; it's unbecoming of me to be nervous and angry.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her he apologizes.
Life doesn't go the right way.
Don't worry, come and have lunch.
Let me sleep so I can rest.
The manager is not angry with you.
Is the manager not angry?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and have lunch.
All right, dear.
I'm very eager to meet you on my first day of work.
It's a great honor, Your Honor.
Of course, of course.
I know, of course, that you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
But, at the same time, it is of utmost importance.
Reminding of some values and principles that you work by.
In the public interest.
This is what your honor should be.
We all must
The allocation by lottery is absolutely necessary, Your Honor.
That they are thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
What I also want to say
And I warn you from my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
Who is trustworthy, honest, and loyal, and free from these bad things?
Just doubt.
There is a loyal employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, things will be as you wish, my lord.
Praise be to God that we are all thieves.
As you wish, sir, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you have been praised a lot. May God bless you.
All right, Your Honor.
Oh! My lord judge, you know how to choose.
What I wish is that God would guide you only.
Why did you let the devil manipulate you?
You should thank God it was only about honesty.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Shut up, girl, oh!
No, no, I'll never do that again.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Stop him.
This means he has become honest.
It's a shame to say that your father is an honest person.
Is this clothing?
Your whole body is covered.
What will people see?
And God willing, if you're looking for a job, no one will hire you in this state.
Is there a respectable woman who covers her body and charms?
She covers her chest, wears clothes that go down here, and strangles herself.
I'm tired of her, son.
And I bought her a blouse and pants that revealed her midriff above the navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to be on the right track.
I'm telling you here!
You'll have only yourself to blame.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us these days is just looking for the right man for his daughter.
Let me tell you, my son Rashid.
He is a very good man.
What doesn't stop drinking ever (proverb).
He's drunk 24/7.
Drunk, tipsy, and hungover all day.
And don't ask about the mess that's happening.
He is a well-brought-up person.
And let me tell you also that he is a hypocrite.
And how is theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how are the drugs?
It's clear, he's finished. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupils, I'll make a bet on it.
By the way, oh! Abu Sara, we've come only to ask for her hand.
You know the meaning of fun and gathering.
We know she comes from a good family.
With the blessed son, with blessing, thus life goes on, with blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Alright, come.
Okay, bye bye.
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why should I call him?
So he can come to pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, standing with his keffiyeh with a blonde girl.
Frankly, your father walks straight and enjoys it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's right.
You've confused me, my daughter.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in the year two thousand and ninety, after signing the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest of these claims are those raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, Clause One Thousand, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Let's move on to the crucial meeting now.
Mr. Chip,
When Israel agrees to establish the State of Palestine,
Oh! Man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation and leave me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Mr. Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
Fully adhere to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find anything solid, be it a rock or plastic, as a commitment.
Oh! Man, even our homes.
What do you call it, you Gulf people?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
Under the agreement, American companies will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very important point, and I would like to vote on this matter because growing nails is considered a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
So that you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him that.
This is the fourth school you will start working at tomorrow.
Because I established my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys followed him and tore his clothes, and he did nothing.
How many times has he come to me without a ghutrah.
The manager told me that.
Rashid is a nice person and we don't want to fire him.
The children throw chalk at him.
They pull his ghutra in the break in front of everyone.
They said that this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the deal with ketchup? This is new, no one told me about it!
They poured the whole bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop him.
By the way, the manager you'll be starting work with tomorrow contacted me.
But, never mind, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The era of kindness and weakness is over.
Oh! Cousin Oh! Abdullah
You will see a different Rashid.
There is no need to remind you of the important educational maxim.
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know this quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
If anyone makes a mistake,
He will get into trouble.
He said that when you start talking, you should just shut up.
You'll see what I'm going to say.
Which one of you mocked me and told me to just shut up? Which one?
You're the one who told me to shut up!
No, not me.
So the person next to you, it's you!
Get up, go to the manager.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
You should not only be like this on your first day, but you should be like this all year round.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
When I'm explaining or speaking.
You know what that means.
Nervous, you know what nervous means?
This means he's nervous.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
Go to the school principal.
Take your things and leave now!
Take your stuff.
I don't care.
It's clear that he's still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see him.
By the way, the ice cream with milk and strawberries inside is very delicious.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and man is fallible.
I'm just kidding with you, son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
What I want is the chocolate in my bag, I don't want this.
Well, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your disposal.
You say he's happy with you.
You don't know how to distinguish between a rich boy and an ordinary boy.
The disaster, how does a disaster look green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one chip.
I took him before them all, I bothered them. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, go to Saud's place now and get the PlayStation CD from him.
So, what do we learn from this story?
This man
He must have morals.
This is the PlayStation device, and I was also asked to bring the entire PlayStation at once.
Okay, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing at the moment.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into grad school.
Therefore, I thought I had to submit the event file before my trip.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me, but I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything, thank God you secured yourself and relaxed.
Let's assume that I didn't take it this afternoon, he got angry and told his father: No, no, no, it's a disaster, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman.
God help you.
What needs to be done, is an order.
Do you love him, do you love him like this?
Today, children, we will have a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
Whatever you ask, whatever you ask for, I am at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there a professor who brings water to a student, are you his tea boy? This incident will not pass like this, I will write about it in the report.
And you too are mocking, mocking me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
Is this enough for you people?
Good, is this your car?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, wonderful, excellent.
What's he doing?
As you can see, he's going to build a parking lot in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Okay, I've broken the table.
Don't be nervous, brother!
Why this?
Are you different? (Figuratively speaking)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything. Oh, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, oh! Brother?
What do you mean there's nothing and you want to relieve me?
What are you saying?
And instead, what do they call this?
It seems you want.
You want this, as you like.
Quickly, quickly.
Is this good?
This is not what he wants, this is not fair!
It takes a village.
We are coming to Uncle Naif for a discussion, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid to do as he pleases in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Everyone, oh! People, be quiet and let's listen to what Uncle Abu Naif has to say.
This loser, who is now worth less than a penny, is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I hadn't slapped him in the face, he wouldn't have stuck to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players (proverb).
Is this good?
Bye bye.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Do you know that he now owns a jewelry store?
That's why I see you wearing all these rings and necklaces here.
God will compensate us.
Just walk, will you stay in the heat?
I can't believe that the naive and poor Rashid has become like this.
Became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
No problem.
No problem, Abdullah!
I'll tell you the secret.
The professor came, the professor came.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
I'm telling you here, we won't get a chance as good as this one.
I'm looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
No, my brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Give him my regards.
Your mother sends you her greetings from here. I will tell her: God bless you, he sends you his greetings.
Okay, goodbye dear, in God's care.
What more do you want, your brother is going to become a minister, but believe in this, my son!
Oh! Mama, we'll work, we'll work at a high level.
Come on, son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He just gave it to you that way.
This is good, right?
Perfect! This happens automatically, no doubt about it.
Therefore, my beloved, please fulfill my dream.
Before your dream, it was my dream.
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is annoyed.
What appears like this, oh! My brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
Do you believe that he stood up, took the mobile phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's definitely something behind this, and I'm a hundred million percent sure that Abu Sultan holds a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Seriously, to that extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my God! Oh son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes happen in this country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that the women will start talking about this, and don't mention Latifa collecting dishes; she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm stunned, I'm going to collapse.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
This is none of your business.
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
Letting them fire him from his job,
Yes, plan.
He must trust me first.
They told me we appointed him a minister because he was appointed two months before my appointment.
Because I'm quite sure he'll be fired from his job.
That might undo the magic.
What is this?
What's this again?
At every event he attends, the photographer takes numerous pictures of him, so his face becomes very familiar in the newspaper.
It continues to rot until it floats to the surface.
Are you sure?
Just wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Certainly, Your Excellency, Ambassador.
So, tell me,
Did you thank him for the sheep? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be foolish, people want to elevate you and you want to humiliate yourself.
Minister only, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take pictures of me, no. Just the minister, a photo, a photo, Minister.
Take another one as well.
Oh! Brother, I really love your plan.
I want you to take him there.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, and he owns that too.
Alright, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the page before the last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say: "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist. Well, well, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what your problem is.
He is everywhere (like).
They are jealous, they envy you. Only the fruitful tree is pelted with stones. (proverb)
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, and peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For this famous person,
Are you home today? Is everything okay?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today. My head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is getting worse.
I'm tired, really tired. It's been a month and I'm still going around with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh! Woman, I just want him to take me.
I've started to love him.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is anxious, it seems he loves this story.
I'll send my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activities and I didn't read the newspapers, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants to destroy an ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight, man?
Wedding?
No need, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can check with the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Is it okay if I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
God helps everyone.
Will this minister let us sleep or rest?
This means he couldn't find a party, wedding, or any event to crash.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and found nothing. He has bad luck like his face.
Just shut up, hello.
I couldn't find his date of birth, or anything.
Go, you might be able to see the second half!
In every case, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired! Oh, my brother.
Oh man! The newspaper editor says that the first thing is to get his picture ready, then get the newspaper ready afterward.
She said my children had a contest about your husband's picture, the minister.
Someone asks another, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You should come to the café and listen to the comments every day about his pictures in the newspaper. It's just endless gossip.
Wow, his death is very close.
As they say, if God wants to destroy the butterfly, it approaches the light.
People will leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
No problem, who is he?
You've ruined my reputation.
God bless you and bless her.
She said that we were all married except poor Amal, who was the only one among us who hadn't married.
This is my destiny.
Marriage is not my fate.
And forget about marriage.
God protects us from those behind this.
Do you see those spoiled people sitting over there?
Yes, what's their problem?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father's death, I mean his murder.
You saw it, it grew, right?
It's not right to leave him attached to the maid.
Go and make tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mother. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two for him.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere; Khalid is my son, not yours.
You don't have any problem except for Khadija, the maids, the maids, and Khadija.
Mom, this is not good. Khalid spends twenty-four hours a day with the maid and wants no one else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a minute, I haven't told my father about you yet.
Let me tell you something, what's wrong with Khalid?
Saud says Kholoud wears makeup and acts like girls. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Saud.
Khaled puts makeup on his face! Just simple makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small spot, it's even indistinct.
He is kind, friendly, and polite.
I'm going to argue with Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to become when you grow up, and you didn't tell me. Tell me now, what do you want to become when you grow up?
And you, my dear Khaldi, will be an employee. What do you want to become?
We will go to London this year just as we did last year.
Yes, contact the shaky person in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susn, Khalud, and Fahad.
And say hello to Samoura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
My father told me today to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said what I want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow, oh! Amal, I want to open my eyes and be told that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
And do you wish to speak to people this way outside?
I can't believe this! Oh! Khalid.
Please leave my room!
How unfortunate, Khadija!
You've disappointed me.
Come, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Poor Khadija, my light, I wish all children had the tenderness of his feelings and emotions.
And when you only see a kind and quiet person, you say they are gay.
Shame on you, shame on you to say such things about your brother.
Stop, you've made a big fuss over nothing.
Poor thing, he just puts on a very nice perfume. Now what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
I'm telling you this in private, don't say it in front of your father.
He has it.
I'll show it to you, but be quiet so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How did these girls meet?
It's a shame for such a beautiful girl to do such a thing!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he felt there was something about him.
Grant yourself rest.
I know you're monitoring the Bluetooth devices spreading these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Do you want to drink something?
I've seen him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I've told you not to try.
Seek refuge in Allah from the devil, my son, for my sake!
I have already made a reservation.
I'm going far away. How can I face people? I can't!
What should I tell your father?
Say anything to him.
Oh, these kids only bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Of course, this would be the result.
Stop, please get out.
The right thing is always painful.
The jar broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is off for a while.
And you're blaming me, Amal?!
You are a girl and you spend all day at home.
What can I say, being a man who spends every day with people outside.
This is difficult! Oh, hope.
I can't live while spending my day, my life, and always having my head bowed.
The father feels for a while that there is something wrong at home and that there has been a change.
For how long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my parents and sometimes I don't.
I can't blame him, Amal, when I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves home, he leaves the responsibility of the children to the mother.
We don't want to dredge up the past now.
Does the father know about this matter or not?
But I'm ready for it.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my father's face.
I'll be devastated.
Whatever! Oh, Hope,
He knows how to throw us.
Knowing that is much better than learning it from someone else.
How sad it is that our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called Khadija had exploded in it.
And customs and traditions.
You will find them arrogant.
And closing their ears to it.
They don't want to listen to him.
They only listen to one voice.
This is filth and weirdness.
They trample on all the good.
What's on your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, "May God help you, my son."
God help you.
The people who return are the ones who bring the gift, not the ones who are traveling.
You're right.
This is the law.
But every rule has an exception.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did his daughter see him?
I can't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Daddy, what's wrong, Daddy?
Daddy!
Don't be upset.
You're a wonderful person.
Any man would want to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because I see something wrong in you.
I have divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept to be my children's uncle.
Sexually deviant like your brother.
So, they asked him.
You're here every day.
Before you never come.
I was hiding underground.
That was back when we were in the catacombs.
These are very powerful words, can you handle such words?
You make twelve hundred, you earn a lot of money!
Say, "What Allah wills."
Go, go.
You've only been here for seven months, stop complaining and take me home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is mocking you.
He came less than seven months ago.
You've disturbed me, my son, you've disturbed me.
Send it back to him so we can get rid of it.
Return it and bring someone else!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know how much it costs in time and money.
And driving practice. Take him back there and let's get rid of him!
The first time I came to my house was six months ago.
Alright, I'll tell you something new then.
Petroleum is now $114, before it was half a riyal per liter, maybe five riyals. Everything has become expensive, boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
When I first came here, what was the salary I gave you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, new. You've only been here for six months and this salary of eight hundred is too much.
I need money.
The driver you're talking about is old, old, but you are new.
This amount, which was seven hundred, is now eight hundred.
Go!
He said he would give me a raise of only one hundred riyals.
Three hundred is no use.
Is what I told you the right thing?
No, no Shashi. I'll be in trouble when I run away.
No, I'm afraid not, Shashi.
Those who flee from their sponsors.
Why are you afraid?
Because he preceded the shepherds of these people.
Give them a salary between six hundred and seven hundred. Do you know how much they're paid?
How much do you earn?
So, why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
God suffices him.
I woke Nasser up and told him to go see it.
There was no one.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have you done!
They did everything they could, they took his passport and put it with them.
You may go. Oh, sir, you are excused.
We will look for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They've put us in a bind and caused us harm.
I asked you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I will find him no matter what.
He will return, which means he will come back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him back to his country than let him stay here and make money.
The straw has broken the camel's back, I hope I can find him.
Come in, men, now. No one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what were we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't be able to score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared, you were afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three goals.
This is the level of our team, I know it. I'm talking about the level of our team.
This shows great confidence on your part.
The rival team has nothing.
Great! The foxes have scored a goal now, you're leading 1-0.
Where are you going?
Going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, man.
Why are you trying? You won't be able to beat our team!
Your happiness, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said this is a big problem.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend will come to pick me up and take me to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend Sajid! Oh!
Take it, boss!
What has he made of himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Yes, oh! He's a football fanatic.
Don't talk like that about my team, the Foxes.
They will win, they will win.
Let's go! Oh! Sajid, let's go! Oh! Sajid, hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up. Take a water bottle with you, the Foxes are playing today.
Dear viewer, with us is one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, his name is Fox.
They say you defeated them because they were incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What is missing? Each team has twelve players.
If there's not one or two people, that won't change anything.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Alright, congratulations to the Oh! Foxes on their win. What's the last thing you'd like to say to the foxes?
All words stop.
When they mention the name of foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Here we go, oh! Handsome.
So, where is the Indian young man who loves football?
Haven't seen you in a while?
Oh! He's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and didn't have money to buy a cup of tea.
The man gave the boy a tip of twenty riyals in front of me.
What made him become like this?
Oh! [The man], sits with important officials in the club, helping him and doing everything he wants.
May I say something, Fox?
Yes, uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This team, the Foxes, is my favorite team.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
I didn't hear the poem he wrote about justice, Your Honor.
When we played a match against them.
Please, please, wolf, throw, throw this poem, throw, throw.
Uncle. Oh my God, who knows my secret?
My spirit is in great pain.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're the Fox Fan Club.
You can't tell me the winner's name so I can have a scoop.
We will hold a press conference, and, God willing, we will announce the name of the winner.
The one who spends.
Thaaloud, the famous fan, who was honored today by the Fox Club management in a generous, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Fox, on this lovely honor, and this is indeed a wonderful gift.
In your opinion, is it a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is a sign.
I'm telling you, it's him.
We need to inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All the fans, all of them, all the fans.
No, no, no, oh! My son, that's not him, he just looks like him.
I'm telling you it's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the game schedules, oh! Brother.
How can we catch him now?
All we have to do is wait until the Foxes play their next match.
There he is, there he is, I've seen him.
Okay, let's follow him.
Oh! Brother, you're late.
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Go after him, follow him, follow him, go after him.
The problem is that we're not sure whether it is him or not.
I'm telling you, Dad, it's him.
I say that the right and wise thing to do is to go to them and ask them, saying to them, "The driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?"
Dad, you always complicate things.
We're reporting him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, may God preserve it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
And also the other land adjacent to it.
Tell your father, Abu Abdel Rahman al-Subayji, to greet you, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken. Oh! My son, we came for a friend and thought you were him.
God Almighty creates many people who resemble each other in appearance.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Honor.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
"Excuse me, I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God bless you, bye-bye."
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm very scared.
What have you done, Waleed!
When, when, when was I walking, I caught the bag's handle inside.
And try to solve the problem now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now try to make your father understand this!
Before my father finds out?
It shattered into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's buy something like it as soon as possible.
Before my father arrives.
Please, oh! Mother.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't leave it.
He didn't do anything.
He accidentally hit the vase with his bag, causing it to fall and break.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter! Oh!
You terrified him and scared him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he comes, I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Waleed is.
Come with me, I'll show you where he is.
Let's go. Come on.
Here it is.
Please, grandma, I don't want to go back home.
Hide me with you.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear to God, I don't know.
That's how your father scares you, God guide him.
Come with me, my son!
Don't be afraid, son, as long as you're at home. Don't worry, son! Oh!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything. Oh! Abu Walid.
Please, I beg you, Abu Walid!
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did you find at home?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, my son. Oh! Waleed, your father won't do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, oh! Yes, my son.
Will you leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me that he needed me to bring him one like the one I brought him that Walid broke.
He wants the exact same thing. I went and found only this, it's the last one in the store. He's very lucky. Where are the boys?
He studies in the room.
Alright, I'll take care of this.
I'll just play this game and then I'll stop.
Oh my God, how amazing!
Well, study then!
Dad, this is just a game, and then we'll study.
Please, Dad, don't tell Uncle.
Daddy, don't tell your brother. Daddy, I swear this is the last time.
I'll call him.
And you, in particular. You've insulted me, am I your friend at the café?
You'll see if I tell my brother about you!
Alright, I won't call. The phone is in my pocket, so if you're going to study, that's good.
My daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
God guide you, mother.
He scares him to death because he beats him all the time.
Poor boy.
Be patient.
Mom, where is Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
And she went with her.
My sister doesn't stick to wearing abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
Her son is the age of Waleed. God protect him.
And the same height.
She told me yesterday that she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I found out the story yesterday.
He argued with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's wishes.
He must take his son and chain him in the middle of the backyard.
And then he told him to do it again and pee in your bed.
It's much ado about nothing.
What did you say, Oh! Mother of Manira?
I was telling her, "Eat, eat."
Eat and be healthy.
Poor me.
Mama, Mama.
It's good that your father didn't find out about you.
Or else he will beat you to death.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up, or he'll cause you a catastrophe.
I won't listen to what you say.
Poor things.
They are crying and shivering.
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my children.
I must take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why will you take them to their uncle?
Nasser scored forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them there.
Frankly, I agree with his point of view.
Forget feelings.
My brother should punish them.
Okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get a perfect score?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I warned you, but you didn't listen to me.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
You shameless boy!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Ah! Stop, Uncle.
Even next time, study well, study!
Alright, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll make you jump one after the other, and you'll become falafel.
Be careful about going with your family to public places.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Hey boy! Everyone has gone, even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance, meaning he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
His father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back! Oh, Walid, come back.
Welcome, live on air, to our new episode of the program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of total energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf states and Iran alone have six hundred and eighty-six billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Then comes Venezuela, with seven percent.
Then Russia with five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we attempt to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite their prices being significantly high
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
which will appear successively on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
Today, what determines the price is market power.
No, it's not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a role in that, of course.
But other factors are
The other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
Stock markets, equity markets, and the like
And I moved on to prices in the field of speculation.
"Commodities" like oil, for example
And tomorrow it will reach $1000, God knows.
The price of oil rose in 2004 from $44.
And we see today that even oil prices
Fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
It rose in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring, and secondly because most global filters are undergoing maintenance.
"Which was always, for the second quarter"
Seasonal demand for oil has decreased.
In winter, the temperature drops below freezing.
And all these factors indicate that speculation has power and control over the market at present.
"A lot has changed" when we revisit the traditional market of the past.
The market was previously affected by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked significant reactions due to its link to the anticipated American war.
Political or Geopolitical Implications
It could quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The effect will certainly come and will have its impact.
Even speculators react to political influences.
Those who might confirm that would say, some of them will tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, honorable member, is being asked in light of what is happening at the White House.
This led to a return of tension in the area.
This is the mystery.
But perhaps Falun saw this scenario.
He has a quick glance at the oil market.
Today, the numbers prove, we suffer from no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased to more than half of what they were in the past five years.
Today, I mean... I don't really mean to say...
Not even for the coming war, because I tell you today that the world has a profitable stockpile.
Even for today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What risks does this issue pose?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred dollars or maybe three hundred dollars, it might be less.
Things might come to a head if these tensions turn into real conflicts.
Because the Gulf, as I said, represents sixty percent.
In a distant country, even from oil-producing nations.
You will see how the impact comes back on the oil market.
It could amount to three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or three trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
There are more than a hundred transactions in it per day, i.e.
That these tensions in the region and the waiting
As previously stated, April will be the month in which this war will be scheduled.
God knows, I didn't do this, I mean, the Chinese.
In the area because that's now.
This year is the year of elections.
And that the current American administration has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not expect events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America won't pay anything, you will pay along with Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
He now relies on African oil, and he has many other alternatives.
Look, there's none..., let's be clear.
In the introduction of your speech, you stated that sixty percent...
Oil reserves
But now they are issuing twenty-two...
They import their oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and everything they export from any other region in the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number, it is made up of fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called deep water or deep-sea production
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough player.
Caspian Sea oil
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They are vandalizing and destroying it.
The important means is there.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG), and that's why these countries are a tough number.
And the energy needs of countries
It certainly means there's something called secure supply.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon himself
But there are still some concerns.
About President Bush, that he might
Try to notice how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
It doesn't mean no, no, no. It's not a matter of generosity because none of us deal with generosity.
No, there's a lot of generosity in the dealing.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity.
Or be generous.
But he is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
Specifically with America.
Where the market is.
We will go where we find economic returns.
We won't do that.
Like oil and gas
You will do it out of kindness.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
Not the rise in prices.
But the persistent decline of the US dollar
You are primarily a citizen of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
The export process must be in dollars, and you are refusing that.
Currency exchange despite the currency having collapsed, therefore.
Even if going back is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
This is the experts' talk, not mine.
Okay, the dollar dropped by thirty percent and oil rose more than that decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004,
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
And this of course means
Rise in oil prices
But it's a minor increase, honorable deputy.
That means if we take it.
We consider it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to the year 2004.
And even exceeded the rate of decline of the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
React to the dollar's decline.
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market has started to give a sense of.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the downturn two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and there is more.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the British pound.
So the question is, why peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historic age.
Oil and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It is said that America in the mid-1970s
The gold standard that the US dollar once enjoyed was abolished.
This is not true.
Okay, so tell me what's correct.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
OPEC's share of the global market today
It's forty percent.
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
That prices oil in dollars.
If you price in another currency, everyone will do that.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states, the heroes.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the elite.
Reserves, but I consider them exports.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under the umbrella of OPEC.
And their market share does not exceed forty percent.
It is produced and exported outside of OPEC.
And this cannot be linked to the forty percent.
He can't do that by himself unless...
Some countries have tried, but...
Not a genuine attempt.
It's you who is rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
He used to export only one barrel before.
If they import it, it's considered a loss.
His currency rose tremendously.
He sold his oil for dollars.
He received it in his input or receiving device, got his money in dollars, and then converted it to his local currency.
Its currency is not tied to the dollar.
True, but...
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you wouldn't have any issue.
The main question I'm asking now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid a declining dollar?
It was tied many years ago.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and enjoyed immense power.
This withdrawal is not that simple.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here.
Divorce comes at a cost.
Working for the benefit of these countries, not against them.
In profit and loss
The Dow Jones Index announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf finance that says there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been exiled.
He said yes and that there would be a study, but all Gulf countries must also.
Profit and loss must be examined very carefully without emotions.
Leave the matter for study and until their arrival.
Look, I can get you other economic experts who can conduct another study.
What contradicts this study?
Global House said something very simple and well-organized, which was issued in a report dated March 8, meaning
Just four days ago
House Global is the simple solution and it needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first of all.
Her intention, or the five in addition to Kuwait, regarding her intention in two thousand and ten to issue the currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to abandon the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
To see the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
And what will come from the reserves and huge returns
Therefore, this is what the Prime Minister focused on when he said:
Gulf countries because no single nation can do it alone.
Unless it has strong economic content
And today we see economic growth, even up to the euro.
Of course, you must not forget that the central bank plays a big role.
In assessment
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all this news
Tense situation
As observers said in 2008, Global House said this inflation would continue.
A long time in Gulf countries but the solution is in the hands of governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflation process that
And here's my question now, when will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short commercial break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Saudi Arabia.
Has reserves of two hundred and sixty-four billion.
And two barrels out of every ten barrels.
Nine out of ten products are produced daily.
One million, one hundred, one and a half, produces one billion, produces twenty-seven million.
Qatar, with a population of fifteen and twelve billion, produces eight hundred and fifty thousand. Oman, with a population of five and six tenths billion, produces seven hundred and seven thousand.
Bahrain has one hundred and twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand.
Total revenues reached thirty-eight billion in the year.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the total gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states reached seven hundred and seventy billion in two thousand six.
The total in 2007 is expected to be seven hundred and ninety-nine million and seven tenths of a billion.
to be in the year two thousand nine hundred and twelve and one out of ten billion
While inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will increase to three out of ten by 2008.
Kuwait accounts for fourteen percent, but it is expected to become eight and nine tenths in the United Arab Emirates in 2008.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eaten.
So, what are the amounts and percentages you will give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries are always there and salaries always increase.
It is not the solution.
I'm not against raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true
We always
Of course, there is a belief.
In the event of an increase, an increase without control of inflation will cause inflation to devour all these increases.
To solve the inflation problem, a high-level committee including all experts and specialists is formed.
And now this committee is developing
Because salaries around the world are on the rise.
And of course, the golden rule of economics says
It won't have an end.
And regardless of how
Substantial salary increases, no matter how large these increases are.
The inflation rate will rise.
The solution is necessary and must be implemented.
Bayt.com, a specialized employment institute, conducted a scientific study here with the assistance of the British company YouGov Siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in Gulf countries across twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and professionals, they have no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour
Especially those with experience.
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation continues to devour everything.
Now you will lose.
This is the easy concept, and you put the easy concept and try to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
He is present there.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are trying to do our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they only aggravate it.
Its increase means
We hope to have more time for this committee to act.
All applications
This is boredom, your happiness.
Boredom will always be present.
True, but the state tried and covered the increases by forty percent.
No, there's an important point here regarding raises.
Regarding increases, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris are working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You consider Qataris but you don't consider non-residents.
While it has the highest ratio.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about it and suffering from it.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we have seen
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector has become
Because the best units and competencies have started.
I also read a report, and as you know, we work in the oil industry.
Labor force
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these matters, what is the percentage increase in salaries?
Hope in Allah, the Exalted, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
A temporary solution is better than none.
And we'll see, I'm sure.
That there will be something
Positive results
You'll be on the cusp of the top fifteen percent.
Okay, the second good report says that 22 billion barrels of oil will come to you and 43 billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, this is not the spraying process.
Procedures, of course we do.
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on the people.
And that reflected any economic growth at that time, but today Qatar has the highest economic growth rate in the world.
The reverse is also true.
As part of this, the country's massive "carriers" are also involved.
Even if there were no such massive "carriers" and large-scale projects.
In this country, that won't be part of inflation either.
Which led to some inflation
This also led to a lot of money being available in the market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil for Protection
I'm from the United States of America, so stability in power
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Frankly, this is a good episode and a good title.
The thing I really want to talk about is that the region is now subject to American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit also reached Japan with a figure of sixty-one billion dollars.
Japan has already invested in two thousand projects.
With America, it's like nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an indispensable currency for the entire world.
Brother, I'm telling you to buy now.
And the Gulf region will become
As a place
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Waseef from Egypt
Hello, happy deputy with you.
The Arab rulers in the Middle East, sir, remind me of...
When there is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjust the salaries against prices as Your Highness said.
In Qatar, we considered you a role model.
And they continued not to promise an increase, for this is the Arab style.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Trika.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? It's certainly his right, and he's responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Excellency the Minister must take into consideration.
This is one second in which he must respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people of the countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who do not care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to the honorable minister.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, which is a positive thing.
Great, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will remain with them, God willing. We know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are certain of this.
And he issued the judgment in which he stated that Qatar is as he said that the money goes to the ruling family and to the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's respond to the brothers first.
Cannot judge
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities about to become like Pearl and Lusail and other places, and this means that Qatar is also growing.
This is not true, rather the opposite is true.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we still have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will seek to achieve?
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because
Non-renewable resources
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, the prevailing trend today in the State of Qatar is
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
This educational city now includes some of the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because oil and gas are today's energy sources.
No, of course not, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not just the island, you'll make a hundred islands, and of course we won't accept the island.
Because these countries are our countries, we in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, a shift occurred, and now everyone remembers the shift that took place in the 1970s.
Now when we see what Qatar has achieved in growth.
This calls for a special episode on Qatar in the post-oil era.
With our vision on oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I send my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you from the program Without Borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Welcome to this week's episode from the Qatari capital, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
And so, the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006
And the unlimited support continues for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With its older sister, Saudi Arabia, about two years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime occurred in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file in which he succeeded when others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Other difficult files
Who ensured to be the driver of these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is based.
And for whose benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country in geographical and demographic terms, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable him to do that?
And this will be in a live dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
And for viewers who wish to participate, they can call us on the program's numbers, which will appear shortly on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera unleashes its roaring cannons to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, like Saudi Arabia's attempt to control the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its issue dated June 20th of last year.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not so.
What I believe is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I always used to say that accuracy is
And we consider that the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover,
And different viewpoints.
It is true that the border issue has been a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations were distinctive.
These links, if we notice them.
Between the two countries and the two families.
Devastated by the misunderstanding.
Neither before us nor before them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And this has been done, and now the relations are in a state that I can assure you is excellent.
In favor of the Cooperation Council
But how were relations improving between the island and Saudi Arabia when the island was the obstacle and the reason for that in 2001?
There is an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
Not just the older sister, but I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council was on
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
We value our relationship with her.
There was some sharp media exchange between the media outlets, and it was clear to both sides.
These countries find themselves
Unsuccessful when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
They found themselves in conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think this is considered a strategy by anyone who was a party to this conflict.
But forgive me, Sheikh, allow me to put things in perspective or to dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers see Al Jazeera, in the past few years, as...
At a time when the conditions that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still in place.
Because of what is happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Whether detainees, opponents, or others are still holding out.
The island stopped addressing these issues.
Even Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has been politicized.
Praise for the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing in a time that differs.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because I
What connects the two countries.
For the stability of the region.
And this strategy continued and reinforced stability in the region.
The area you mean is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
Also, the invitation of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving and overcoming Arab differences, and burying them.
Not just in terms of views.
No, it's present in politics and politics are points of view.
Considered in the Arab world
A kind of war
While in the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
I have stayed for many years now.
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this topic and the other topic.
The idea of a small country standing up to larger nations and making them feel vulnerable.
Any difference or misunderstanding
She had her reasons.
And her reasons ended.
Ended thanks to the wisdom of our leaders.
Are there any guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties.
Based on the bonds of love, brotherhood, and mutual interests that unite the two countries.
As for the leaders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope for much from this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
For the better and there will be more fields.
For this relationship, it resembles the one that binds us to other Arab countries, and other Gulf states.
Because Qatar is an important country.
Okay, so Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that you reconciled with Saudi Arabia at the same time.
And three organizations are Hezbollah.
It is Al Jazeera channel.
"Are you against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?"
Let me start with this first.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian people.
and his own interests
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
And this is the case.
Some will think that through this case, we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say about respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people
We believe he is a good person.
Our disputes with Egypt revolve around two main points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't believe that.
And we do not interfere.
In cases concerning other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny that. In fact, we didn't know about this issue as much as others did through the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or caused disagreement between you on this point?
I'll get to it.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised by this subject.
It swayed in favor of Qatar.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids said: ...
Attacking Egypt and its center
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they talked about.
The days will reveal that.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back in time to the Mina Conference
After the Madrid Conference, do you remember the MENA conference held in Doha?
And it was a coincidence, and when the conference was scheduled with us
They said they don't want to hold the conference.
People, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
Heading towards Qatar, and this is it.
What are we trying to understand the reason behind?
We sat and talked, and conversation is always beneficial.
It consists of two parts.
What are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the Gaza conference that was held
His Highness the Amir spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
A foreign state has informed us of that.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a stance on this matter, which is that it should not be held.
People are being killed while we watch it.
If you don't want it to be held in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be shameful to discuss the issue at the Kuwaiti conference on the sidelines of events.
Israel's and the Western world's stance of standing by and watching what is happening.
When we all said "Okay, this is now a common thing, and there is no power or might except by God," we Arabs cannot stop this matter, not even a large country was able to stop this battle.
Egypt's declaration called for a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, and within an hour the fighting stopped.
Therefore, even we
We should not deal with the Arab street with such naivety; our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This complies with international standards.
There are not enough hospitals, and doctors are being detained at the borders.
It was you who stood at the borders.
It's there, and no one can enter.
The brothers didn't take the news well.
Because Gaza is located next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We hope a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
And even the subsequent rescue mission to Gaza
The Europeans tried to save him.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a conference to provide that and so on, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference, but were asked to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be released to any party.
but will be released to
The affected parties in Gaza
That was done directly.
Because entry is not allowed from any side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the Qatari people are happy for Egypt, because Egypt
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted of what had been banished and said:
And anyone who harms Egypt, we'll cut off their leg and break their arm.
Frankly, I think this official has insulted his country.
In fact, they didn't fail, they only talked about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To end things in the Arab world
We agreed.
That the king will decide that this is in the best interest of everyone.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them is an insult even to those who stopped them.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
Maximum limit reached
He believes he must assert his strength.
We are sorry, we apologize for this matter.
If you think the small state has no right, its rights are being taken away, and that's a right.
And you rush in and place your noise in Darfur
It's an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A plot I don't know what it is in Qatar.
If that happens, it's likely to be after swine flu, and if the disease appears somewhere in Qatar, Qatar will be the cause of spreading this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because any Arab disagreement
We believe that any Arab disagreement would weaken our position regarding our main issue, Palestine, and all other challenges we face.
The Arab world became a future.
Even our analyses have become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there's one thing we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way that makes me want someone to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Does anyone blame Qatar?
Did Qatar insult any Arab country?
Try to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
I could walk by and say "As-salamu alaykum," and you would say, "You're greeting me just to provoke me."
This is another case, which means that you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This matter concerns you, not me.
But if you have internal problems
We say it all the time.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
I am in Kuwait and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks from his heart.
His heart, I always say this.
I always say this.
I always say that even at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say
And you can refer back to all the documents you have on the island but
That the case is different, no, no.
From one side, we said no salvation, let's stop at this situation.
And we have tried our best.
I don't want to get into this topic.
Let them mind their own business and where their mistakes lie.
And we see our errors, but this does not mean that everything we have is correct.
Are you referring to this, Your Highness?
Due to internal problems in Egypt.
And they want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes to any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to cut its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
And they are seventy million if we can, no, rather eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
That you played a role in the Shalit case, despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you cooperated with the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
We said, "There is an issue we must address," and they replied, "This issue concerns the Egyptians."
We want to consider this matter as a request.
From Israel and from another country, we want to see another part to watch this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions existed, the brothers should speak to the brothers in Egypt.
We have stated this, I mean, is there any official who can say that we meant to deceive the Arab League?
This means he is a poor person.
How did he manage to miss us?
Let President Mahmoud Abbas stay.
We supported this matter.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own Al Jazeera as I have been accused.
The island must enter the media competition, as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media entities, and during adolescence, they all insult each other.
But they will eventually reach maturity.
It may be or it may not be.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country, as Egypt is the largest country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and our relationship is different.
It's a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a disagreement over policies and viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar has done to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And since the news had leaked to the press, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable separation
And I cannot tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it so that no one explains it away as no, you are comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that if Egypt obtained the appropriate satisfaction,
Satisfaction among children
I don't think so, Egypt is bigger than that, I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything else, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I call
Someone tricked him into thinking there would be a style.
And our pride in Egypt
There must be a certain way.
Either he stands with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we struggle with it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States enjoys the sources of China's power, the sources of France's power, and the sources of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
And this is evident from the fact that
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one will take anything from us.
As for Israel, you have been provoked now.
Okay, before I go to Israel.
How can you resolve the issue with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, and if I wanted to tell you about the great nations you were talking about.
They deal with us on the basis of self-interest, and thus as we are.
All complaints and all of them.
With the aim of ruining the relationship
I believe that any great nation doing that would affect its image.
It will also affect our Arab pride if we run around complaining about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
We're here for them if they need anything.
Are there any further steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If there's anyone pulling the strings
Against the convergence between the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself a loser.
No, it might be tomorrow or in ten years, I honestly don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our elder sister, but we have different views and discuss together.
This is all that is required, and when the time comes we will be very happy.
That was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you're asking about the number of contracts that were cancelled, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
On June 4th of last year, I stirred the feelings of Arab countries when I closed the Israeli office, and it was published in the arts on June 4th.
Why are you saying that we want to bother them? If we wanted to bother them, we would have closed it 12 years ago.
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after most Arabs made peace
With Israel, whether under the table or above the table or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner for Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this feast, and I don't know why the ambassador held it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egyptian issue, but unfortunately
It wasn't me, it was you.
My question concerns the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States in light of the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Jad is serious about solving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will assist them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with the United States is bad.
Firstly, we must put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you think the agreement is still valid, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day and minute by minute until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you're still connected to the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and how much they love to go there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
A quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi affair, and there are some accusations that you supported them.
Or that it puts you in their direct confrontation with the state, and now there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the South.
And we have suffered a lot, and this indicates the reason for our standing here and not there in Qatar.
And indeed, we faced a lot of pressure, but this was our vision and this was the position of His Highness the Amir.
The topic of the Houthis.
His stability affects us positively, while instability affects us negatively.
We intervened with honest mediation between the two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's meant to be used for other reasons.
And to be there with them, we always stood by them in all situations.
This is not based on a real foundation.
I see that we have no need.
We sell them.
I say this with apologies, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
Finally, greetings from the program team, and Ahmed Mansour greets you from Without Borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you, and welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say it's a special and exceptional interview? Because
Qatar and this particular man were the main sponsors.
Sir, I have one simple and direct question.
I believe that happened due to an Arab consensus from the beginning.
We tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, as was the Lebanese management from both sides.
To achieve some results
It is very important that there be external intervention.
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arab if you want to say
It went through stages, but it meant something.
That there is nothing unless it means that these stages were present.
Does that mean the complexities in Lebanon
Since the time of truth
I mean when you met and directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file now.
Did you discover that the Lebanese complex is huge?
Lebanese Arabic is an international and regional language that requires significant decoding.
Or is it just a minor problem that has been magnified due to external interference?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese should not allow that.
To affect peace and security in Lebanon
The first problem
It is the spillover effects in Lebanon.
I suddenly decided after 24 hours to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect that, they couldn't rest for a single minute unless you were kind and allowed them to.
The secret is not to let them rest and think too much.
And making a lot of calls.
We are suggesting to bring them to Doha because we need a suitable atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with great difficulty.
In many circumstances
We have brought them out of these circumstances into conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
God has granted us success in the Venetian Statement or the Beirut Statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believed that Qatar was biased towards one party over the other.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
His Highness's policy states that if we are mediators,
In this process
Okay, frankly.
Did you consult seriously?
With at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as I have spoken with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud in that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It had to be removed due to the tension in Palestine.
There is the case of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
They organize conferences to find solutions, so why can't the Arabs, who have ancient ties, do the same?
Unite the Arabs or unite the parties if there is any, or intervene to support the oppressed.
That should be under study.
If we want to issue a call to wake up to the Arab world, not just the League, but the Arab world.
The Arab League is nothing but a tool for implementation.
He was one of the officials here, and the president was Nabih Berri.
requires
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
Listen, okay, we
And above them all, Qatar.
Never led to a result.
For the Arab interest.
That will be considered a source of strength for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations when we went for the Doha Agreement
And the action plans that were developed were for the purpose of solving the problem, not for other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And play a more important role in the entire Arab world.
Placement
Stop that pursuant to our agreement.
For others to come and help us
Because this is a serious matter, however.
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our courtyard?
In our square.
It is extremely important that we put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What will we do for Somalia?
What will we do for Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part at that.
I hope this isn't a suggestion for this idea.
Qatar enjoys good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we are not asked to do something, we will do what we can.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because Saudi Arabia and Syria had a historical agreement.
It can only be a transient stage.
And we will find that, God willing.
But I still insist on asking, if you don't mind, could you play a part in this scene?
Even if it's not public yet, you have a kind of trust.
What rapprochement between Arab states do we seek?
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
Does what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is about to witness serious changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is an internal affair and a particular regional issue that remains ongoing.
Not related to this situation
I wish the opposite, I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, Minister, are you concerned about the escalation that was present before?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
Undoubtedly, I still feel concerned about Palestine, but now the issue is about Gaza.
I want to ask
We don't need anything else.
He asked me to take care of the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can't get the medicine to them.
And no food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The person who will die when the power goes out.
I wish
The Arab League agrees to an amount allocated for this matter, which is food and medicine, and we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, I'm just saying that as Arabs, we need to deliver medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and pledged in the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
The statement that we won't deal with this party because we will find a solution for you is incorrect.
And I
So far, I have no indication of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that they don't want us to establish relations or contacts with Israel.
Some might consider you an integral part of it due to the American bases located there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said it happened after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia.
He may have met, consulted, or spoken to the Saudi host.
Negotiations between Syria and Israel in Istanbul
And I can say that it was just a coincidence.
The second subject was one that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was keen to find a solution to, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change the tactic. Change negotiation tactics.
Either from your side or from other parties.
We, as officials,
And from all sides we shut ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... Then, His Highness's intervention was very important.
Based on it, an intervention plan is developed.
Without saying it now, it's over.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, our role, and so on," as if...
He wanted to play a role without offending any other party.
Whether it is Arab, national, or regional.
But nevertheless
I became responsible.
Did you want that or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
that these countries
He can do that or
I think this will be a profitable mix.
The last question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it a long-term relationship, and is it a regular or special one?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
This doesn't mean we don't have different opinions in some cases.
But this is our right, if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How can this be good? How can you explain it in practical terms?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Also health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and make that clear in the next phase.
In my opinion, we should set aside confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the Arab court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we can be a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. Farewell, and best regards.
Welcome to our viewers in this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Welcome, Sheikh.
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue we will be able to
Highlight some of your questions.
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
And sister countries
And how can a clear and strong Arab stance be found that Arab countries agree upon?
And thus, we find areas for reconciliation.
We know from our location that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
And no one was punished while
We are being punished for everything, whether intentional or not.
We are the specialized people.
In the world, they are the only ones who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
To the extent that we won't be able to
Leadership-level meeting
To halt the discipline campaign
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They wish to be right and our opinion to be wrong, because the goal
The goal is to solve the problem, not to hold a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now is that the ministry not cancel Qatar's request.
Which His Highness also affirmed.
In his speech, he said that if holding the conference in Qatar would cause any embarrassment, we do not insist on it being in Qatar, and it can be held elsewhere.
An Arab stance that others respect us through
Yes, and the ministry as well.
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He had no role in making the decision, and he continued to kill and bomb in Gaza, and he still does.
And I need to ask the Arabs what we are going to do about it.
What are we going to do?
Is this when Israel ends?
Implementing the remainder of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a confrontation because Israel did not stop.
Shooting, we don't force our brothers.
To a decision that is considered final.
A few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You'll end up supporting this matter.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and it was our idea as well. Other countries also requested the summit, such as Syria and Yemen.
There is already an Arabic pirate there.
Or they classified us in the camp of moderation.
And the camp of the non-moderates.
And what do they mean by excess?
This was arranged by the West.
Moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You will not find a moderate state or a non-moderate state.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And ending the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we can just leave the case open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are these countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
What I want to say is that he follows Israel's agendas, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name the camp "Moderation"
What is moderation in the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections have been held.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a reality that exists.
The fact of the matter is that there exists
Idea
What some people call extreme movement
But we must ask ourselves what this extreme movement demands.
Is he asking for something beyond his rights, or is he claiming his rights?
Or will we arrange them?
And creating other blocks as well.
Against because we
Internal and cultured Arab
And this started happening
Therefore, we do not want to wage war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit from taking place?
I can't say it was prohibited; there were minor efforts, and the matter was almost known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could have.
Hold a vote and get two-thirds of the votes.
But that wasn't the goal because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, that's what we believe.
While others believed it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or if there is a resolution in the Security Council
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel has said it will finish the matter and then consider the issue.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
As for changes, disagreements sometimes occur.
As much as
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
And also to address the Israeli party and inform them
I don't think everyone is ready for that. We're supposed to investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four, and we are committed to the truce. Eighty-four, and the Israelis are not committed.
It's natural for arguments to occur during meetings, but in reality, these arguments...
Representing their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the reported conflicts is
That some have described Hamas' movement as distracted.
Not even a few of them.
This situation occurred, we responded to it, and I was there with one of the ministers.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are extremist movements, disintegration, and other names.
And we do not want to be men for others.
And so he always means it, and I don't mean anyone by it.
Any foreigner they find.
In any Western country or Western countries you find
Among the Arabs
Okay, now His Highness the Sheikh.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred and something?
One million Israelis were marketed.
that was issued after Resolution 1086
The issued decision.
Israel did not implement that, but it will implement it after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation has made an effort.
This is what we should be grateful for in this decision.
For us, demanding Chapter VII is because Israel is above the law.
And if they are asked about it, they will say: "We know."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they didn't
If that's the case, Israel will not be held accountable.
He is above international law.
This is realistic.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try to do that for us.
This matter requires a difficult decision.
Decide that
It can lead to the official losing his position.
We were terrified of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out the attack must rebuild Iraq in full at their own expense because they are the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not demand the Iraqi government and not seek compensation for those who died.
There are no compensations.
The same exact thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Happiness
His Highness Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Results
Israel did not comply with that.
He will adhere to it in two days, after a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they didn't comply with him.
Sorry, but people need to gather information.
Because Israel agreed after it had finished the mission.
Do you have an alternative to this decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and I don't mind having any kind of relationship with the West, and neither am I.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
And in the end they'll take one percent from us and we'll say we won.
What is victory?
Including its contents
I cannot say anything about precautions now because the decision has not yet been made.
The council is master of itself.
I participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to attend the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went were enough.
I pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, Your Highness, Your Excellency
For two years up until this moment
Listen, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
I can't claim that we were informed about everything.
If they were people.
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there the conflict began and the siege started.
Last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they collapse because we don't want them in power.
Those parties, His Highness the Sheikh
Clearly state that the Palestinian conflict
I mean, if there was
Who created the Palestinian conflict? There might have been a Palestinian conflict.
To tell one party no, you are one hundred percent right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I'm not claiming that or saying that.
But, the mediator in the middle is usually equidistant from everyone.
Not only the average, but we Arabs are also equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want it to exist, so we must eliminate it by any means necessary.
Once through drilling the troops right and left
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And when we create a positive model in the West Bank
To show how people live to the residents of Gaza
Luxurious life
While the reverse is true in Gaza.
He was invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but this time.
Any talk still circulating around it between Hamas, mediated by Turkey.
It seems that this meeting you've been invited to is aimed at circumventing.
That would be a detour if we took another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We are asked to play a role, and we support any Egyptian effort to reach an understanding.
But this is important.
Don't come.
Tomorrow with a party that seems to have overcome another party.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
Is this, in your opinion, what is required of Egypt?
The proposals now, and the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Sir.
I have a vision for this initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, which should exist, we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Those who were injured at another party and whose perspective we should also take into account.
So that we can accomplish these medium tasks.
By the way, to adopt a point of view.
Hamás' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into consideration, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participated in drafting without communicating with the main party concerned about the issue or seeking its opinion.
We only want, of course, to deal with Palestine as a state.
We deal with power as a unilateral party.
But now there is a split in one party somewhere and another party elsewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we will have to stop dealing with people either at the bank or at the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask a person from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced about that?
As for the resolution first, it did not mention a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some of them and consider them a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading this decision is that it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving this.
He who stops the fighting.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this resolution to be non-existent because Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, Your Highness, regarding the Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time and
Or an Arab excuse.
Or the Arab conflicts that can never be resolved, and so it came to fill this void.
It is supposed to be filled by the Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A stance that should be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
Therefore, this role is a natural one.
And that people should follow him.
There is no Arabic pronoun to solve the situation.
Someone will say, "Let them finish the task."
There must be a clear Arab stance and a decisive stand against all this aggression, its continuation, and its postponement.
That there is an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, for we are a people who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I do not call for an Arab war, but I call for
A clear Arab stance
Of course, within the framework of initiatives and proposals, you follow what is happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an observer of the reality on the ground
The political situation that resulted from the military operation will now allow Hamas to impose its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
I know nothing about this deal, as I told you, they are not present, oh, now they are negotiating.
The second thing
Well, in the required places from Arabs.
This Arab reality
That we have witnessed this after the start of those operations.
It seems that a very advanced position has been taken by the Arab street.
Who are we as governments?
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe the people's gift as such.
Once again, they are telling me about this matter.
Representing the views of the people.
The presidents now.
I mean if they want to.
At least they see what
Of course, there is a high demand and a modest one.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
Close the Israeli representative office in Doha.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
They consider that the Arab side should be extremist and take extreme positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
Not at all if we had an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
Let's walk with our Arab brothers.
If there was only a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They are dealing with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that do not have any of that.
This is very important.
Don't become agents for others.
He says why shouldn't Qatar be a role model in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to join it.
But we also want
Qatar is committed to part of its Arab commitment.
Like
No one shall sell a person for another.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret, and I don't want to mention the brokers.
Therefore, this matter is very important.
Because we don't use formal invitations anywhere, and we should rise above this level.
Some called the ambassador, some organized protests, and some expelled the ambassador, like Chavez.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some demanded the summoning of the ambassador, and those who called for it included the permanent member states, and all of this is theater about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
Due to high expectations, there is someone demanding the opening of fronts. Some are demanding that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I've told you that we call for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not want to fight Israel.
To wage war against Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
That make us talk to each other and overcome our differences.
What you said, Your Highness, has caught my attention.
On condition that nations do not sell each other out.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street will not have mercy on us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what's happening today a continuation of a project that started in 2006 during the Lebanon War?
Or there is a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
Some parts are still supposed to be a deposit for the United Nations, of course.
Or something like that
I mean Lebanon; we have dealt with the Lebanese issue extensively.
Israel, of course, needs weak states surrounding it.
Until you are in control and have the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them, and they are foreign countries.
Therefore, he wants to remain the only power in the region.
And they want now.
To change this example using Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you talk to?
And how many sides does it have?
While in Palestine, there is only one party.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to too many Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and each party believed it would dominate the other.
In your opinion, as an observer and follower
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
Do we as Arabs accept this matter because it might happen again to those who don't obey?
Or express his opinion.
Whether they are Israelis or others in the future
We set a great example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral saying: "Me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother, and my cousin against everyone else."
Now we are supposed to disagree with Hamas on everything, and I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else can't make any mistakes.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must abandon this case.
Force something to kneel
Because failure here will not be the failure of the group.
His Qatari Highness, I usually meant that in a previous period, Qatar was trying to put forward proposals.
Initiatives to find solutions to what happened in Lebanon
That happened in Darfur, and we will talk about it in a moment, even if we are in a hurry.
That we
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are certain sensitivities.
And if there is one country that will take all these initiatives, we have no problem as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar front-page news.
That was not one of His Highness the Prince's objectives.
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
End the dominance.
What happened was beyond imagination.
We are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a respected solution
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know the outcome of the Justice and Equality Movement's initiative to resolve the Darfur issue.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will be mainly about resolving the Darfur issue because the Darfur issue was at its inception.
Help the Arab.
But we do not ignite an issue that we have made an international issue.
Based on revenge against the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
As I mentioned before, we always strive to implement decisions, and we are the best people to do so.
Excluding the case from the competition. Is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go through that.
Before we summarize the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this conference be held? Will you attend it?
No, we will attend the summit.
We wish it had been held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
That would be a shame.
Alright, if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they are now gathering for financial and economic reasons.
Help with heating
But it seems that no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances I'm referring to. Of course, I hope nothing happens to us and we remain safe.
And to be safe
But no one takes a person in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, I thank you sincerely.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So what is the point of this celebration and the sincere statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
That people with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
And what about our Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
These and other questions will be put to our guest on today's show.
Former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt
And held several positions in the field of disability.
She is a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In the year nineteen eighty-nine
And the vice president of the National Committee for the Disabled since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest oversaw the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome Mrs. Hessa to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we called them disabled in the 1980s or earlier.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide them with this education
An important document appeared at the United Nations in ninety-three.
"Cover the duration and before we review the details"
From other regions, although there are areas that are not considered or classified as developing countries and are classified as poor countries.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend is stronger there than in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
There is a trend towards legal rights in the Arab world, and it exists in many countries.
It is possible that resources exist, as well as political will.
Okay, let me tell you some statistics here that you might know.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Hassa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
This is largely true.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas subjected to such events, namely wars and conflicts.
There, you cannot distinguish between the disabled and the able-bodied because they are present in large numbers.
In fact, the percentage of illiterate children among females, for example, is around fifty-three or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from accessing school, even if they do not have a disability.
In fact, the city doesn't have infrastructure even if this child found that school.
What he can reach.
For children and other residents
These agendas and projects are great, but we barely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago, what is the purpose of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities
There are organizations that arrived and established numerous projects.
Implementing a health strategy is very important.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and that's better.
At the awareness point, we pause to take calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her, as she used to work for the United Nations.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against regimes that cause harm to children in society today, for example, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the regime given that there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kro is from Syria, thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait, welcome Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If you don't mind, I am one of the people who suffer from a mental and intellectual disability.
I hear Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
And there is a verse in the Quran that says: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, God has given us speech, so praise be to Him who has given speech to all things.
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
Praise the Lord because He made me speak.
I was talking about the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without realizing they're at the bottom of hell.
I got nothing but notoriety.
And not telling the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And also mental disabilities, of course.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or what are their reactions to the causes of disability, such as political or other goals.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out how far.
There are disability topics and situations included in their work agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already addressed the issue of disability.
It is one of the programs that try not to overlook children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings, and we must acknowledge that there are also shortcomings in the United Nations.
What are the most prominent weaknesses and inefficiencies that you talked about?
For the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered him.
My work is especially challenging at times due to constraints or limitations.
The struggle or attempt to fight against people with disabilities for recognition.
Until he reached a somewhat acceptable level, but he did not place it in a separate subject as the Global Disability Movement desired.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of his main flaws.
The survey carried out by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies, and only three of them responded.
Do not put.
The issue of disability has been a persistent and ongoing concern for many years, even though it is primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, about two or three years ago, praise be to God.
The issue of disability is at least being raised through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international regulations?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating salaries to people with disabilities.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach the disabled?
The final observation is that if there were no binding decisions for Arab states,
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
Her adoption of this proposal.
It is writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To be converted into this box
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of annual net profits
I return to our guest to answer callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have surgery, but
It was costly and beyond his means, so where could he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
The citizen must enjoy all these rights and duties.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of the people within the national framework.
Or even at the non-governmental level
It is binding on all States and must be enforced to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least there should be awareness at the level of officials primarily.
It must be at least that if we work on these treaties in this way.
Even if there is no great commitment to it.
Is there any response to the monitoring reports you conduct, and was there any interest?
But don't forget the rules, they are a morally binding document, not legally.
There should be a commitment and it should be legally ratified.
Recognizing that these cases will be resolved or discussed or will be within the framework of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakharna, director of the national center for sign language expert for the deaf at Al Jazeera Channel
First, Mr. Ali would like to express his profound gratitude to Al Jazeera.
That has now broadcast this episode live.
Ali is speaking now and says he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them are unaware of this agreement because there were no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions.
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with disabilities in all countries of the world.
And I insisted and emphasized that these countries should act.
Adoption and signing of this agreement
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aimed at serving people with special needs and serving us.
Many thanks to my colleague Naji, speaking on behalf of Ali.
Thank you very much.
Your opinion might contribute to making a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to spend this money on the activities of the Special Rapporteur when he or she is engaged in them.
Even the Arab countries did not donate except for one, Syria.
The issue of fulfilling those commitments is a problem present in the United Nations, therefore,
The box
The lack of commitment by member states, unfortunately, and the lack of interest
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we don't care about the current situation.
Is it really a matter of obligations?
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, in particular
But for these reasons, those covenants exist.
In order for these countries to fulfill their obligations, however, this is a good idea presented by the brother.
In addition, it is essential that there be no single independent box, i.e., independent in form, but rather existing organizations in the region.
What they have in their budgets
Provide special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities
The case always involves political factors.
His state or government guarantees significant support for him.
Unfortunately, it leads to a reduction in numbers.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, his citizenship was revoked.
They took his beloved, she...
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
When we travel or go out, we get confused.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
Rebuilding themselves with that knowledge.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Behjat Kawan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed is from Qatar, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes to you, parents of children with special needs.
For Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa's continuous support
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome!
There is another level, the genetic level.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a cousin always marries his cousin and so on.
In this way, at this level, a level of disability. Thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as I said, at the national level
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Falls within healthcare services
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I believe it's in the psychiatric clinic and also in the programs available at the Supreme Council of Education.
The Special Education Department, frankly, I don't know if it still exists.
But certainly this falls within the scope of healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And rehabilitation services are available for such cases.
Prevention is better than cure. Are there any campaigns related to genetics and consanguineous marriage?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this field
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
One of the things that I and others have addressed with many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not targeted only at women.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And also, of course, Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision to carry out early screening.
which have been implemented in many countries
It's all about the preventive aspect.
And do such campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it conflicts with customs and traditions.
And of course, the difficulty lies when it conflicts with societal culture.
Making a decision to develop strategies and having the will to deal with it and commit to it.
The issue of early examination, for example, because it is a very important matter before marriage.
I would like to ask if there are statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
For the Arab region
And especially
Given the recent events that have taken place in the region
In regions, conflict zones, and wars, especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
For every person killed, three are injured.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
Not at all, it's not enough; the most important thing is the issue.
With the principles of human rights
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Existing plans within current institutions in government and non-government ministries
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only your words addressed to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and the strangest thing is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about the population census.
Up to now, disabled people are not included in the statistics carried out on the population.
They don't always advertise that.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I think that was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and
The Council established it as a fait accompli, with our participation, like the Special Rapporteur's office.
Assign more categories to disability cases.
The needs that are supposed to be present.
The types of these needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
The question is whether there is a disabled person or not.
But at least
Statistics are making some progress in this regard.
Peace be upon you
My lady, thank you for this program and thank you, Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
My daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Its motivational role and its role in making us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those upon whom this category relies.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar. We are still with Qatar and with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
Dear sister, reality, truth, expectations, and what we await is solving our children's problems.
What is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope you can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
I attest to the services provided by the State of Qatar, especially for those with hearing impairments.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even if the gathering includes civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities
Because reality and what we hope for, if you compare them, that will be after five years.
What was provided for people with special needs five years ago and now?
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem from Jordan, and now we return to our guest.
Of course
The society as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families, which
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or anywhere else
The international convention resembles many other international documents.
We are committed to translating that into plans and strategies.
To provide these services automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Alright, Sheikhah Hessa, you have previously worked as a special rapporteur and were concerned with persons with disabilities at the United Nations, after six years of work.
Did you wish that?
Perhaps the time wasn't enough, or perhaps the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of that.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
That there are more research and larger-scale studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Increasing awareness is a continuous process that must be worked on constantly and extensively.
Coordination among Arab countries
Among people themselves, among persons with disabilities and their organizations, because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They must fight for
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
God willing, we will host a new guest tomorrow.
Join us with your messages and contributions in a new episode of the "Live" program. See you soon.
Good morning
I'm very happy to have you here with us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and talking to you this morning.
Thank you, Shaima. Maybe I've congratulated you.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has already marked its place on the world football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Also me, please! Oh! Ali
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens for hosting this event.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
This was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and we will start working from today or from the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, weren't you afraid in this field on this particular subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said there was a seventy percent chance Qatar would get it.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitive.
Why should we be afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's bid was very strong and it deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 file, the World Cup, and hosting the tournament are all matters related to the State of Qatar.
So, what do you think the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I'd like to say, %pw, we were talking off-air, but we want to hear that on-air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you hear the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, and praise be to God, everyone provided us with support.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and hosting rights,
All Arab states have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are famous for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima
I went at that time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the French News Agency was filming there.
As we conducted interviews
Everyone cooperated, and now Qatar is mentioned daily.
A hundred times a day, considering it's the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will get to know Qatar even online.
To host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by joining the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
Therefore, a person making a great effort in this is a positive thing.
Be in the league, even when you're in the league, dedicate all your efforts.
Whether in training or in matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, so he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the officials have made a great effort to take care of young players, teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience, as you've played at several age levels. How was your experience, and what is the most important stage for you?
That was, of course
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
Therefore, each stage has a special mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving around.
We're both used to you now, sports.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We loved watching you and getting sports news from you. So, how is sports with you?
Frankly, I don't see any difference from talk shows. In talk shows, we hosted famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and others in their sport.
On the contrary, the field of sports is active.
Especially since we are considered the capital of sports.
Qatar has now become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of offering a variety of talk shows, social, economic, and cultural programs
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it remains a sport.
Excellent, great
I was sincerely hoping
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
That's why I think the young players have gotten a great opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players will be the ones to have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity they should seize.
It's a golden opportunity.
Therefore, they benefit from it greatly.
Tell us, what are you doing, what are the new programs coming up that you will be presenting? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
We are always following events and preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup. By the way, we would like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The news bulletin is also available to cover events.
My first media appearance was through Qatari TV, of course, as my roots go back to Qatari television.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Deliver the media message across various channels.
Whether they are private, sports, or other channels
Therefore, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you good luck, we're still talking about the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And his supporters, I was at Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, the sheikh Nasr was with us.
He is still at the club.
I'm still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism is the important thing.
That belongs to everyone in Qatar.
We know that young people already love and are addicted to sports.
How can we make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in all the various fields of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, and schools are also realizing the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, reflecting an awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also points to women's awareness and participation in the sports domain.
We now have a national league for women, dedicated to female players.
That's why I think sports are evolving.
I also believe that this period of time
To produce massive projects and increase awareness of sports, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If considered and implemented carefully.
This is enough, and at the same time it must be used wisely, as I said.
Also, there is one point, which is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's also an important point, praise be to God, we are in Qatar, and as you know from all Arab and Gulf societies, we are known for our passion for sports.
How to engage this audience to keep up with sports news and football matches in Qatar.
And to attend the games at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse internet forums, you'll find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, in your opinion, what is the best solution to attract you to attend, aside from being a sportsman and player?
What are possible ways to attract the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a home gathering.
For example, Japan has developed a wonderful plan to attract a wide audience.
When they bring in games, they collect points, or anything else, so they're looking for solutions, so we hope.
And Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar, specifically in the year two thousand and twenty-two. Lana, what do you think we need?
Aside from financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participating in a massive global event, the World Cup.
Time flew by with good people, and when the producer told me time was up, I really said, "Inshallah."
Always achieve the impossible, achieve the dream we thought was impossible. Alhamdulillah, we're living it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, these were moments of celebration, but the hard work has begun.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host the year two thousand and twenty-two
Thank you, Lana, the wonderful presenter. I wish you all the best, and I will always watch your shows to get the sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new type of music that is popular these days.
But in the form of repetition with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a group of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and good morning.
We try to catch a glimpse of it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
It's a performance based on repetition, but it's not rapid rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
consisting of numerous rhymes and addressing a variety of different topics and issues.
It can be personal sometimes,
Social, emotional, or political.
Often controversial,
He is quite liberal.
Rapping the lyrics, our viewers are not singing along.
But he keeps doing it.
He flatters with his voice, which he considers a secondary asset.
Generally, sound is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not referred to as a singer, but as a rapper or an MC.
Rap singers are concerned with the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and connectivity.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rapping.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
Firstly, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished in something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
So, why doesn't this exist in Qatar?
So, we said we'd invent something new.
We gave him an idea containing a message.
We talk about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, we send a message first, and secondly, it's art.
This is an art form among diverse arts, and it is a message to the viewer, as it has addressed many social and psychological issues among young people in a radical way.
Time changes, and I think that has something to do with the changing times.
There was little acceptance in the past.
We've been singing since around 2005; acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
There is greater acceptance and fame.
People love singing and performing in a similar style to rap these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, certainly, a high percentage of people.
There's also something we want to talk about. You've been a founder of many musical groups.
A beautiful band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about for someone to form a band, and how many are there of you in this band?
At first, before the band was formed, we were
Rap started to reach Doha from the year 2005 onwards.
This means that anyone who loves the idea of rap and can sing, can sing and upload the song on the site.
I can download, Salman can download, anyone can download, so there was competition.
We met the people.
So, we started competing with each other.
And then, after a while, after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, there was a group system, where each group was self-contained, with three or four people together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one group under the name 'Qatari Rap'?"
Or Qatari rappers in English.
So we agreed to this, and said that we are under one name and all of us are together as one hand.
And we come to present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! If God wills, that's a big group.
So, does anyone here play an instrument, or do you all rap?
Coordinate and write.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Each person has their own potential.
This means that everyone in the band can write a whole song.
Without any help from anyone else.
But capabilities can vary; for example, if Salman is better than me,
He heard her and told me to change the words, to change something.
They can transform into each other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that adopts, so that an official body adopts these works.
And there will be appropriate distributors.
So that the work turns out neat and becomes something official for you.
Frankly, we were hoping for support, and we got support from a company that came and adopted us by producing an album for us.
We don't have any problem.
Some things are a little difficult.
So, why don't you think the first move should come from you?
So that the individual can recognize the first CD.
If you do that, you can attract companies later, what do you think?
In around two thousand and seven, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I think so.
Normal, because in 2007, rap might not have been prevalent in the Gulf.
But it wasn't as famous as it is now.
We were talking before we were on air, for example, there are great groups like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we discuss this matter?
They said they would organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and the work was excellent.
But there was some pressure because there were no advertisements and there was nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That was a good comment.
This means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal only to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were many songs and we were many.
The entire group
What are words, and how do they deal with different issues?
We are talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before that*
It has to be this way.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it includes the name of my program.
This is the KDWDJMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This lady Kay Jay Bobo with SKT, one hot body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch it.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The director is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
Since it already contains the name of the program, thank you guys!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it yesterday.
And who wrote the words, or is it?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if you wrote to Joseph
I'm not writing these words just because of my love for singing, and because of my passion.
I suppose you have to write about the 2022 World Cup, the Asia Cup, and I suppose you can do that.
Sure, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But I don't think that can be official at this stage.
Therefore, I think there should be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are watching live now.
The cup arrived and Doha's streets were adorned.
So, viewers, as we've seen, Doha has adorned itself to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned agencies have made all the necessary preparations to host the event.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll gather along the Corniche side.
I'm sure they are ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up?
There's an offer from one of the authorities, they've promised they'll organize a party for us.
But, there are still some complications.
The procedures and some issues, so we're unsure.
Therefore, we try, if you meet Joseph and watch.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of his performance.
When I'm at home.
And then send it to Youssef via my email.
This part of the song is dedicated to Youssef.
There's also another thing, do you travel abroad?
Those who have millions of fans in this field.
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who have been in this field before us.
But we try to be competitive.
So why don't we take some ideas and imitate some things?
But on the contrary, I take the idea and apply it in a different way to my song.
Those who formed a band and have more than one CD.
A person named Abdullah Al-Dail.
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
A resident of Marat town
There are many experts.
Those who locate groundwater before drilling.
Those who need it or some wells may be dug in places where there is no water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or figs, through which he could locate the water tanks.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, they have been replaced with copper bars.
Therefore, we placed the two rods parallel to each other.
Walk slowly.
We observe, when we walk along a watercourse
The bars will open.
Now, we are crossing a stream of water.
It opens this way.
When we crossed it, things started.
We are now in the middle of a waterway.
And here, it will be the middle.
In this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater present in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site of greatest intensity.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed.
Regarding reaching an advanced stage in this profession.
For his discoveries characterized by high accuracy
At times, outside times, in Shaqra, Harmala, and Al-Othaythiya
Over one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
He needs training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
The town of Marrat is located northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We have watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, if God wills it.
We reached (()) and various addresses, but they possess that.
Meaningful
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Are there specific people you follow as role models?
What you follow instead of imitating.
There is a connection in general between all Gulf rappers.
This is not a challenge, meaning if I produced a song.
Dealing with a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have relations, but there's no one I can
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He
He has fans and a CD.
Many companies are eager to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you good luck through this band.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's watch some footage from the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
That, even if borrowed from the West, is in the Gulf style.
There are also rap songs about love and a unique band consisting of twenty-five people.
It's important to stay in touch with you so we can know your news.
So, I think you have an email or a website or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close for unclear reasons.
Therefore, we faced many problems and eventually closed it.
No use, the site is definitely going to shut down.
So, what needs to be done, and what are the alternatives, to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You should communicate with them to find out the latest news and the songs that are produced from time to time.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
By what name?
"Okay, when you search for our company's name on Google,"
Qatar's rap or rappers in Qatar
You can produce your own video clip.
As for the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
The same song, with pictures.
I think we need to see more improvement from you.
You need a place where everyone can gather instead of having the equipment at each person's home.
Mixer, piano, computer, guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
They allocated a special place for us.
We work alone.
In the end, we're still working alone.
We don't need this.
This is not different from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
The music videos led to the song's rapid spread.
So he conveys ideas faster.
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And let your beautiful voice be heard everywhere.
This is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see it and wish them all the best on behalf of our show, guys.
These projects, yes.
There is also a semi-ready project, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you already have the total amount and all the details.
He recognizes goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
While walking with the cart
It is attached to the cart, so one can choose the material they want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's sense of a problem.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza at the establishment of the center.
It can be so, yes.
Which takes him directly from his home to the underground train.
But his idea is that it's meant for clothes.
All shops in Qatar that sell shirts will appear.
That can also be with the car key, press the button.
He locates the things I've lost and takes me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
It is early childhood education.
Skills development and talent adoption
Therefore, it varies according to different children's skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading listeners
Skills vary, and we have developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with Future Media, and we did a very good job on this project, and we reached the end, which is the graduation of the project.
As we obtained figures for children and youth speakers
And their creativity...
Do you have junior broadcasters?
Regarding television, it's important for them to provide programs for children.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We raise them until they turn eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television.
We need to attract, identify, and nurture these talents.
Whether it's in the field of media or research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and other diverse fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, the Generations Exhibition, is also...
The Scientific Club played a significant role in improving projects as well as in technical support.
The main role was played by the Supreme Council for Education, through its support for schools and partners.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
which also embodies a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a motivation to achieve more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the enormous place
It's easier to deal with the public.
These are pioneering and excellent projects.
And receiving the guest and introducing him to the programs offered to the child
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhah Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted and supported this project.
It's a big project, focusing on developing reading, writing stories, and nurturing children's growth.
Various cultural skills related specifically to reading
Because there are certainly different programs.
We recently moved.
We are rearranging some activities.
Designed and optimized for Katara visitors
We wish you success, through this center.
containing very important ideas
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, and his fantasies.
Connect with him mentally.
They ... %pw, their way of treating their children is like a hotel, they provide them with accommodation.
Or like a bank, save money.
Children really need someone to listen to their thoughts and imaginations.
We were transported to the year twenty thirty-three in the past few days.
At this exhibition
Good luck to the winning projects.
Thank you for being with us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jimeeli, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
Until these projects become a reality and are not just a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. The Children's Cultural Center was inaugurated last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing Ceremony of the National Exhibition of Dreams of Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
It was organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
I would first like to thank you for giving us the time.
To speak about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you with us here on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
Contribution from the Cultural Center for Childhood
To celebrate the National Day
Those who had
In an attempt to calm the children
Living with a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
That's why we've set it for 2030.
And other key areas of Qatar's Vision, 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then, think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you exactly mean by this phrase?
Is it facts or the nation of tomorrow?
In other words, everything the child dreams of today.
It will grow as the project develops.
In fact, this was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children would live from this day forward.
With big dreams
Whether environmental, health-related, human development, or any other field.
Serving the country.
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
In addition to the exhibition, there were guest speakers.
Since children learn from them, they are role models for them.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, there was *
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you're saying.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
And here too is the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
It's a very bright idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there were four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which was the colored ball.
It is also called the smart stadium.
When the ball goes out of bounds.
Colors differ.
I suppose this will help a lot in future matches.
What's next, after all these dreams?
And to be connected to things related to his field of interest.
I suppose so, especially when there are officials who take these small projects into account from small minds.
But we never know, maybe these projects will be useful to us. What does the head of the football union think about that?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Thank you very much, he visited projects related to football.
He supported and adopted these projects as soon as he saw them.
Also adopted these projects.
What our children did, people also voted for many projects.
Okay, what were the projects on the site that people voted for the most?
There is an evaluation committee, and they have a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third prize-winning projects
The forest won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, he needs many administrative elements.
There were very detailed instructions in the pamphlet distributed to visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we see now.
These are some big projects.
Maybe they don't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
This is indeed true, as the institutions have adopted part of it.
For example, let's mention the names of the projects, what are these projects?
Collect, use, and recycle.
Among two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
A large number of parents and faculty members
And the university celebrates today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman the Renewer and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a very dear guest today.
From the Tsaniev family series, the actor Abdelhamid Charshani.
He affirmed himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent."
They worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
And this means
Thank you, good morning, and I'd like to wish the viewers a good morning.
No, I admire the show's cast and crew.
We'll watch a very short clip from one of your works and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake coat and bring the original one.
Go and get it.
You have the coat, you'll return it.
And what? Give me the bisht, return it to me! How am I supposed to return it to you?
The goats have already ground it in their stomachs, damn it.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't approve of you.
I have no objections.
So this is a quick glimpse, a very short clip from Tsaniyev's series, of which we'll be watching part two.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles in the series "Tsaniev," which covers a different topic in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Certainly, afterwards.
I had run a marathon by that time.
Marat is also famous for the mountain.
Comet that poets have sung of throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and a lasting memory in the cities,
This shows how ancient his history is.
It is located 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe it was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its waters, and the purity of its air.
The poets drew inspiration from him and admired him. He was renowned for his famous mountain, Komet.
They call it the Valley of Kumit.
Of course, the city of Marath is an ancient city.
It was established before Islam.
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
This is what we are living now.
The companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered the digging of this well when he passed by it during the time of the Ridda Wars.
Still remains until now.
The proverb says: "Guarantee me a black horse, and I'll guarantee you a bitter one."
If you see Kumit, you can see Marats.
Another effect is the Wadi Kmit.
It is a river that has sweetened over the years.
And that was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of creation of these artifacts is unknown.
And there is also the bride and there
Mount Komit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
There were many proverbs, poems, and verses based on this mountain.
Many people come to him from all over the kingdom.
One of the most important monuments there is Al-Waleedi Well.
Because he stayed in Marrat during the Ridda Wars, and was on his way to Yamama.
He camped there and ordered the men to dig this well.
Some people still drink from its waters and bathe in it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed by Marot.
It's an old mud house, restored to its original state.
It consists of various sections that reflect the architecture, heritage, and antiquities of the region.
The poet once said of it: "When we found water, it was free water."
We passed through Wadi Kummit, not Wadi Al-Anjel.
Mr. Ayman is there, God willing, cooperation between the family, guardians, and the center as well as the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you right now.
Generally to manage the training process.
Since everything that reaches us, whether it be an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, are evaluated every month.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, a report is presented.
The guardian can do this through the password and username.
We gave it to him, can he access it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he joined the center until now.
Yes, we have different models that we will be looking at.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later.
We'll see different models, I wish we had enough space.
But we brought a model of a girl.
You will undergo various tests before going on air.
We will ask her questions in mathematics and other varied questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back with you to watch this smart girl, stay tuned.
The actor's performance, the audience has become very smart now.
If he is hooked by any series from the first, second, or third episode, and if he feels uninterested in the show, he will use the remote control.
He won't bother, he has twenty thousand other series.
Correct, twenty thousand chains, that's right.
Episode 20,000. There are people who don't focus on one task, but rather, it's the task that focuses on them.
He can watch other shows.
This is true, this is the majority.
He claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you as our dear guest and it is an honor for us, Abdelhamid Charshouni.
Do you want to say something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, I wish you good health every year.
It's true that we don't go out much, don't show up much, and don't act frequently for that reason, and I've already mentioned the reason.
What's to come will be better.
We wish you all the best in your endeavors this year, God willing.
Insha'Allah we will have another meeting with you to discuss these plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people, fashion enthusiasts eagerly await them.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Sabah Doha. We are live with you this morning.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who joined this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
And of course, they focus on developing other potentials.
And also to make their minds work fully.
Ms. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Kholgely, Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
You are welcome with us.
And now with us is the beautiful Amanya, good morning Amanya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Whatever God's will, we wish you all the best.
What things are provided for our sons and daughters?
This matter was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was particularly directed towards the benefit of the children, our children.
It is the "Minds" program for mental math.
By fingers and counter.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to present a small part of it.
Did you feel, Mr. Ibrahim, that there was a real difference between the student on his first two days?
And after he finishes in maybe three or four months?
Whether it is taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
The program, scientifically speaking, operates primarily on defined methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
showing the missing potential or the need for further development
Has he reached a certain level or what updates have occurred with the child?
Therefore, we work on a scientific method, on a scientific program.
And not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, and as you can see, viewers, Amany is one of the students who joined this center.
We wanted to do this live today to show you, the viewers, how important these things are.
If you're going to return the bisht, I have no objection.
So this is a very fast and very small part of the Tsanif series that you will see the second part of.
But as we saw in this part of the first series of Tsanif.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tsanif," where each episode covers a different topic?
This year, he focused on the fact that he would carry out the task.

Many actors I can't remember right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohamed Adel.
Tara, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We now have a few jobs in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV channel also produces dramatic works, can we say that?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV did its best, but the work was once a year and all Qatari actors wanted to work.
And that was the reason.
I've replied to you. It's just one series and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
Therefore, if anyone finds a scene, he should thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
So, let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasim is from the series "Hukm Al Bashr," and also "After Al Shatat" yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater.
So, he is the one who adopted us, taught us, and made us.
Then Mr. Ghaniem came up with his life story, doing his best, in Faiz Al-Toush in 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They work between thirty and thirty-two times a year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, Tara, thank you very much.
The film "The Deadly Feeling" is also produced by Tara Arts.
The director of the series is Mr. Monir %PW.
We are back with you, dear viewers, and today we will talk about reflexology.
The message is the palm of the hand, the comfort of the palm.
This treatment has been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The exam format is as follows.
There is swelling, and the degree of pain is high.
You can feel something like sand or cracked veins inside the hand.
Relax your hand.
My friend has frayed nerves.
You feel stressed and suffer from a bit of tension, tension.
Left side.
And now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health issue would be apparent, we know now about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain indicates the presence of a problem.
Problem! What does the term "problem" refer to in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's shivering. Do you have a sinus problem or any previous issues?
I had surgery, but that was a long time ago.
Is it fleshy or something like that?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him he had nervous tension.
Ten years ago, he was walking barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think they're emptying themselves.
Any uneven ground, not just the sea.
The negative energy that may %PW.
And it may be surprising to you that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, children are the most important.
Children, thank God. This is for the mother, focus with me!
What hurts him is the milk and the food he eats.
Her child is parallel to her, she will put him down and the child will automatically close.
Close your hand.
Just a little pressure, thank God.
You'll find it in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, he'll suffer from the pain due to the ache here.
Later, you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What discoveries did you make, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bone, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing is menstrual pains or period pains in general.
She must focus on a rock or stones, for by pressing here, you are giving orders to Allah Almighty to relieve lower back pain and menstrual problems. Count Count Count C
It will disappear in seconds, God willing.
Pregnant woman
Childbirth became easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her that it is possible to give birth in the seventh month or you can give birth in the ninth month.
Except if it's on sand.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
She should eat seven fresh dates for breakfast, fresh dates are better.
If she doesn't have dates, the dates are enough.
As Allah the Almighty said, I seek refuge in Allah from the accused devil, and my discovery is derived from the Quran.
This means that God was not able to make these soft dates reach her, no, He was not incapable.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word 'I'.
She must bring a rock or small balls.
Labor bed. For example, if she forgets and comes to the bad labor bed, she grips the handles.
In private hospitals, you will notice a lady from East Asia will come.
So, this is a practice followed in East Asia.

I advise everyone listening to me now to cooperate with each other.
Make charity a habit and also take care of others. You were created to worship God and
Serving people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and I would also like to thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak in more detail on this subject.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start by taking a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
A program that is part of the national strategy for treatment and obesity control.
Around four of the world's most obese nations are Gulf states.
We have launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
Fearing its spread even further and faster in the near future.
Among the programs aimed at protecting against obesity is the "Healthy Steps to Qatar" program.
We can do this contest together, making it an international contest.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because this is the first age stage where they become self-aware.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about what your favorite fruit is.
The second week is walking.
You must walk! Every time you walk, he gets points.
This is a map of Qatar, and every time someone gets points, they walk and their school moves forward and their class moves.
Thus, a beautiful competition is created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink that much soda every time he feels thirsty. He doesn't drink water!
After that, in the fourth week, it will be your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport he loves.
So we can force him to exercise.
The child eats a healthy meal.
And his family learned that they should let their child eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, we can take from it.
Of course, this is just a pilot project, and if it succeeds, God willing, we will expand the experiment in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had a great time with our peers.
The girls say their skin has improved now, with less acne.
This is true, this is true and it becomes consciousness.
Parents know their children.
Their peers from other classes ask them how they are doing, and they learn from their classmates.
Praise be to God, it is beginning to spread that many schools are eager to participate next year.
Inshallah.
Qatari telecommunications company Ooredoo was the official sponsor of the event.
We had the Aspire zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On, on, on, on the dining table.
Therefore, praise be to God, there are many authorities, some of which I have mentioned and some I have forgotten.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part of it.
And the other, the brothers were doing it in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different kinds and involve as many people as possible.
It's the next generation.
To generalize this experience or disseminate it as widely as possible in Qatar.
When you evaluate, you will find that there are some things that need to be fixed.
After its spread now and its satisfactory results,
Insha'Allah we will spread because there are people asking and telling us, "Why weren't you present?"
Eat, eat healthy food and you will get there, you have no problem.
When we are at this age, starting from an early age, he will reach what he wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
You mentioned, Mr. President, a series of titles, and each group has a title.
And if we return, we will try in our segment today to talk about the conclusion of events.
And when we mentioned people again, we had more than one guest in our program.
Let's repeat that. What information do we want to convey to the student every week?
Well, the first thing, of course, is that the first week will be dedicated to your favorite fruit.
Each lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits containing vitamin C?
Therefore, he started liking some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking; people think that walking is only for the elderly, and why should young people walk?
This means that when I grow older, I'll be able to walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your mind and brain.
This relaxes the individual, which means that walking helps to improve mental clarity.
I took the students on excursions.
Yes, they were all required to walk, both at home and at school.
They earn their points through the class teacher.
They used to walk it daily.
This was an event, and there were people who marched, as well as the girls' school.
We want them to love this and to be creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition, and teachers must think outside the box. We don't want them to give them ideas they must adhere to.
Everyone has their own skill in this regard.
Of course, the third week is water drinking week, we always try to make them drink water, so they don't feel thirsty and dehydrated.brownbro
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport week.
If we could discover his favorite sport and support him in it,
He will be interested in sports.
Their love for sports is manifested in their practice of it; he engages in sports without even realizing it.
We mentioned before that we would talk about the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our guest for today's show, who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We're happy to have you here at this show.
And part of that is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
This is a chronic disease.
that affect the nervous system in a person's body.
The period ranges from twenty to forty years.
There is no cure for this disease yet, and the cause of it is also unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, usually the young.
A treatment used for cancer patients, may God protect you from all harm and other illnesses.
This disease is an infection that affects the nervous system in the brain and the spinal cord.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered it.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
The white cells, or white blood cells, start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Which leads to the neural signal not arriving, being weakened, or interrupted.
Leads to paralysis, God preserve you.
No, despite the development and progress in the field of medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Fine, regardless of the solution, we want to know how we got it.
Also, a person should have protection from this thing.
The main reason for that is quality of life, food nature, or life cycles?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads to a person getting this disease.
All we have now are just theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All these topics may be somewhat controversial in society.
So far, we don't know the reasons for that.
Well, the age group that might suffer from this disease, multiple sclerosis.
I am both genders.
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to calm down with the person.
We have not yet been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a large number of people in the Gulf, or in the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And also Qatar.
Recently, just last week, I heard about three or four cases that were diagnosed.
We currently have one hundred and twenty-five patients, which is the number recorded in the files.
Many people go to other countries for treatment when they are diagnosed with this disease.
Alright, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any effects like someone being infected with this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they are suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, is deadly.
We must be clear about this: it is not a virus.
Because nerve disease affects the nerves that control the entire body.
When giving a specific reason related to a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
