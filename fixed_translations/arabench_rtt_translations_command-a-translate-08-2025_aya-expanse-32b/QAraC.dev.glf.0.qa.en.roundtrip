partnershipat troubles? Saleh, open your eyes, open your mind, look at the world around you, see what people are doing.
If my brother is blind
He refuses to improve himself and to improve those around him.
partnership! Saleh... Don't be stubborn
No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street
partnership some dates, two dates thrown in
And you're hungry.
Will you eat or not?
No, I will eat.
Tell me, did he agree to that?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I'm tired of him.
This is our chance, our cars are shamefully old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and ordinary.
Fool! He lacks self-confidence.
Hey, are you scared?
What really gets on my nerves
Is he in charge of the budget?
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
It's hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget?
And the day we spent in the garage.
This means that I will do.
Consider me in!
It's not fair that I don't benefit from this matter.
Will I get nothing?
This means I'm involved too.
We're supposed to all take it.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
I'm going to talk to him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Exactly as others do.
A feast of wealth lies before you.
Take your share.
He had only one riyal in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the last third is plunder.
Salome's son
He went to Souq Waqif.
One lantern costs eighteen riyals.
They priced it in the budget.
At a cost of one hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said we didn't do anything wrong.
You'll get bored of him.
Seek refuge in Allah from the devil.
Yes, but I think he changes his mind.
Inshallah! Oh my God!
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
And most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We must be together.
This government project is considered an opportunity.
Sure, Oh! Ali
We can't do that without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
God willing, the project will include everyone.
Of course
I was talking with our friends yesterday.
From your side
We are not worried because you are members of the project committee.
They are concerned about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your friends not to worry.
Really? Oh! Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But oh! Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Get Saleh to agree first.
I'll take care of it.
I was wondering if I'd get some benefits.
Is this possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is to keep this a secret between us.
I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
I'll definitely do that.
Health and happiness
What's wrong?
If you keep being so distracted,
It's not going to work.
This won't work.
Or the questions
We'd be happy to help you.
How will we get our share?
Or is this logical?
What shall we call it!
Also, we are not the only ones who will take action.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We'll be the ones setting the budget.
And what about the land he bought today?
Did he find it too?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's the problem?"
Inform your brother.
The Other Earth
next to the land he bought yesterday
Approved for sale.
He said, "Please call him to see if he wants it, I'll keep it for him."
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
And what about our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we weren't participants!
You're eating a huge bite by yourself.
At least give some to your brother and mother.
I'm not here to beg you.
We are also participants in the project, and it is our right to claim our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It is true that when the sultan came and asked for his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You must give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking to them.
They allow their brothers and friends to enter.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't want a limited amount of money and then that's it.
I'm from venture capital.
That his brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wishes.
because it seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want to
Thank you.
Ah, Abu Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You will love him.
It will be useful for the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, didn't we?
You, Saleh!
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Oh! People!
Claim your share.
I swear to you,
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
And sometimes I say
Let me take a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want in the way you prefer.
The most important thing,
And we as well,
So that during this week,
Each person determines the amount of money they want to receive.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And ask for another hundred thousand.
Okay, but why is this happening, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting work, and ignore him.
And there are also the funds of orphans.
More budget.
A large number of people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What's this! Is this your father's project?
Yes, he is a sultan.
Oh! My brother Oh! Sultan
This means he is involved.
Is that the last name?
Your friend Saud adds a lot of names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's take advantage of them."
So, which group should I add it to, the percentage or the monetary amount?
No, put it with the beggars.
How much should you allocate to it? Put twenty thousand.
Yes, enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of that will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one will notice it.
Ah, there's also the list my mom sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Haha, I wish you could live longer.
Apple of my eye, my son.
God bless you, she is sick and poor.
But the woman has no money.
May God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
Shh! Hey, wait, wait... How much do you need?
How much is enough to buy a liver, a residence, and a hospital?!
Around one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers will you transplant!
One, but sister, it's expensive.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her your own money?
Reassure him and tell him that I'm not taking anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Dude! They're going to replace her liver with a new one.
He says, he'll add two thousand. I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends?
No, Mother.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll call you later.
The number of people eating from the feast increased.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They decided that the project will start tomorrow.
They will pay us continuously.
How much is the price? We want to know!
They will present it to us all at once or in installments.
Why does she get more than us?
In a power outage or in a robbery, it doesn't matter, the important thing is to stay quiet, we are waiting for them and they are coming.
He told you to stop talking, so stop talking.
Don't be shy.
If you hear someone speaking
I'll sew his mouth shut.
They kept us detained for far too long.
You know this is money, not something easy or simple.
How much was it before?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss after all.
We don't want any headaches.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, through your speech about the project, we noticed that it is a very important and vital project as well.
And this is not just for this generation.
Yes yes
The first phase of the project will be inaugurated tomorrow.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations'
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
Don't you see that the officials spoke and the people applauded?
We're at the official opening, how are you?
Alright, now talk, which means we're on the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And the people were sweating profusely.
And these divisions, I don't know what they put inside them.
Don't touch the box.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
The official opening of the International Beaches by %pw.
Third millennium, what's wrong with you?
I don't know, to be honest.
Yes, praise be to God, aging is a disease.
I wish I knew why they ousted me.
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when you told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
Receive checks while relaxing at home.
Why the tiredness, my dear? Don't let anyone bother you, Munira.
You should thank your God, Manira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Faqer.
Those who care about your portion and invest it.
Look, there's my friend Hessa.
Her brothers don't give her a single Rial from her father's inheritance.
We don't act this way.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't you trust us?
I don't know.
I'm not satisfied with what my brother Rashid said.
He keeps reminding me about the check they give me every three months.
But this is true.
He always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Financial and inheritance matters should be clear.
If you, my love, are not satisfied
You know what this does to people.
And the mother of Salama is an example for you, that poor woman.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But business is business, and it's your legal right.
And then?
We run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headache.
She said she was passing by the land, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I fear her husband, Nassar, is behind this.
Any problem?
Your sister started *looking around*
This is the problem.
She's planning to get us into trouble.
This is like we're giving her our money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We must find a solution to this, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they aren't investing the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
This is clear.
This is clear.
They said, "Let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking."
This is true, everything you said is correct.
They give me a little each time.
If you only saw their wives.
She has many different diamond jewelry pieces.
I don't have half of what they have.
They don't believe I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you had asked for it,
This is your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing from me and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with the way they're behaving.
Life is unpredictable, oh! Dearie me.
They exhausted me, made me sick. Oh, my darling!
Don't they know there is an accounting and a punishment?
And that God will punish them for taking other people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, oh! My dear
They will be happy.
Is this due to our population growth?
That's why I say, Oh! my dear.
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a skyscraper.
I only want my right.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And give charity to the poor.
The mother is the mother of Slemain.
Lower your voice, oh! Dear
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know the reason!
At this time
Her rights were violated.
You were interrogating the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him.
Answer them!
No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't frown.
Do you know which door I entered through?
No, no
No falcon.
That's unfortunate, Saad.
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and the properties, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure her evil husband did that.
Because she is kind.
As if I'm begging them.
This is a well-known and established legal principle.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
This is not fair.
Expect anything, Manira!
My father's company.
Eight buildings.
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says only six hundred thousand.
By signing a waiver document
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper, be careful, I warn you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else; that's not their concern.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You've just been fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
Is this your father's company?
Don't you see him screaming?
Let me in, I'm telling you.
Leave it, there's no need.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, make him stop.
We are sorry.
My brother Saad took him to the office and explained to them, they don't know.
Please come in.
See if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink.
Please come in.
Certainly %pw
You're going to get us into trouble.
He will find out how far she owns.
He will discover that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's calculate it.
In sixty-nine months,
This is the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million, five hundred and twenty thousand.
No problem, so what happened?
Let him do everything he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
This is our money.
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Welcome to your company, don't pay attention to what happened.
Welcome!
This is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser may have.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, and don't ask for permission for anything.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go to his pocket, take it.
Let him look at all the files.
She is supposed to have taken more than ten million.
They didn't mention that.
She used to say she was poor.
That her father had left her.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every piece of land is larger than the other.
God is sufficient for us in all things, He is the Protector, O my son!
What they're doing is not right.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Umm Salmin?
I have no choice but to sue them.
He will browse through some papers.
The case has been postponed.
Be careful, my son Nasser!
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh! Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O Mother of Salmin.
Go to your room.
And all the Muslim patients
What he told me
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, I remember you now, yes yes I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
What is it, brother!
No problem, thank you.
Now that he knows we have the money, he's gone crazy.
Do you think that this Abdullah whom I sent to them can...
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, since years ago.
Do you believe Monira?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Chase them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as possible from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not for people who live seventy or eighty years.
This is for people who will live for at least two hundred years.
Mother of Muslims, may Allah have mercy on her.
She used to say, may Allah have mercy on her.
Our population has not reached four hundred thousand people.
And that the case will take ten years or more.
Do they have to *mummify* us before we can consult the court?
This is it.
Yes, my love, are you sitting with them?
Good luck
By the way, he's an old friend from school days.
Life is short.
And I am looking out for your best interests.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And that they are deep-rooted.
Please, Rashid, we're friends!
Please leave before I calm down.
Or you will be beaten.
Go far away, forget about friendship.
Are you going out or what?
Paid one hundred and ninety thousand for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibit.
Where did she get all this money from?
They waste money on their wives.
And depriving their sisters of their wealth.
Do you still have hope, Nasser!
Fought with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you.
Well-known people with deep roots
Possible, why not?
But I also suggest
May God bless these words uttered by these bright faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with that which benefits us in our worldly life and in the Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than my sister's dowry issue.
This is true.
It's better for you to go or you'll be beaten.
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
I don't care.
I'll go tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
She won't go to court.
After tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Goodbye
Being kind to them is not helpful.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
We'll see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow so we can go there tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did that.
I hope your life is beautiful.
I hope your life is perfect.
Why? I told you we want to leave the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first park your car in the parking lot.
You will see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Are business cards available to all lawyers in the country?
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here to mock us.
We want her to sue us.
Go to court.
Listen to the *manoor*.
And they sign a document for us renouncing.
And this is a good thing.
You know the way.
We've shown you the way.
Let's go, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is today's Al Raya newspaper.
There is a very good article.
It was written by a woman, and I assume she's a doctor.
I want you to take a look, as a gift *from me*.
His living conditions must be changed.
This is unfortunate.
He has four children, but his home is miserable.
Certainly he will, for he risked all his wealth.
He took a risk on this project.
The person I would never expect to start a project is Bou Waleed.
Eat, eat, O sons of the new merchant, Bou and Walid.
My love, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, get yourself some fruit.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
Health and prosperity, health and prosperity
My son Waleed, put a little sweetness for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Oh! Bou Walid, you deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Daddy, when we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Alright, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry phone.
Forget their desires now.
Like everyone else.
Instead of our small, miserable house
First, let's pay off all our debts, then we'll see.
You look very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, lucky he is.
All the poetry is from my father the merchant.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese man, he was among them.
While we were seated, I switched seats with him, and he gave me a catalog as a gift.
Later, one of my friends saw him.
He said it's an opportunity.
Multi-purpose halls?
"That's always how it is."
They are computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want the field...
This is magic.
They were amazed; they all said yes.
I took out a loan from the bank, borrowed some money from my relatives, and sold a piece of land that I owned, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has agreed,
Why didn't you ask for it since the ministry has approved it?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
Thyme tea
Nothing, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, brother.
And be away for ten days.
This depends on luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee agreed to it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you a fully authorized manager?
Why don't you go to him to get him to sign it?
I told you he can't.
It is what it is, all the employees there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving at times.
You must thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Are you finished?
How can I finish this if Abu Fahd is never coming?
What can I do?
After that, I will lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible so we can finish, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
His saying "I am sick," means anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say that while you're his secretary, what about us?
And give me your mobile phone number.
This is not the secretary, go ahead and sit down, sit down, this is not him, what's wrong with you?
Don't call, you scare people, they thought you were the secretary.
No, we're still waiting, Abu Fahad.
%pw, my money that I used to fix the bathroom
He is a stupid person.
Oh! People, wait, wait
Certainly, certainly.
He told you to be quiet, enough, shut up.
Bu Fahd had to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God help you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear!
But he behaves strangely.
And if he does not receive the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
She now needs him.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
He is here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I've told you.
I told you.
This is beyond my control, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but that's not fair.
Classes will start at the university next week.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
Oh! My darling, I'm trying.
Don't you see that I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd arrives, Abu Fahd.
And I will stay at home.
Don't you understand?!
Don't call me when it's lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
But, hopefully Boo Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they will pay him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
She woke up in a state of panic.
He walked and talked to himself all night long while sleeping.
If it weren't for Fahd's fall.
God helps him.
And for this reason,
Bo Fahd must sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And I'll travel for a year.
And leave the comfort of the people.
Oh oh oh oh oh, how did that happen?
Do you feel better now?
Tears me apart.
This strange fever controls me, drawing me in.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
To complete my paperwork
He told the staff that he would punish me.
And the time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
This is Bu Fahd's secretary.
I'd like to tell you that
Tomorrow, Bou Fahd will come, for sure.
As soon as I call you,
Come directly.
Good morning
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on the screen of your mobile phone.
I said it's a loss.
Until you feel responsible
And if you adhere
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printed paper
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
He is a pitiful person.
The manager punishes him.
By taking him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes and the manager finds out.
Sure, yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of it, just let it go.
Bu Waleed
I'll go, but I'm waiting for a phone call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait
How can I know where he's going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
To go and look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley
**T
Call the hospital quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I've spent my whole life as a mail carrier, for many years, until today.
All this time, oh! Bou Said
What were you thinking?
About fourteen years.
As a messenger
This is an annoying headache.
Sweating without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike used to be easy?
With a yellow sign.
It was a very difficult period, oh! Bou Said
Misery, oh! My son.
But what can we do, we're only human.
Bu Saad
Alright, excuse me guys, the manager has arrived as he said, let's go finish our work.
The manager has arrived. Oh! Great, let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son Khalid has been hired.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Pigeon thief
I told you when my last son graduates, I'll quit.
Graduated and got a job.
Praise be to God, I will finish my work soon.
I served you properly.
Praise be to God.
Change your mind, oh! Bu Saeed
And you deserve it.
Thank you very much, Oh! Abu Abdulaziz
I am so grateful, oh! Abu Abdulaziz
Hey, you
We have done our duty.
Let them continue the journey.
This is your right.
After all this age and work
It means they are all running back and forth.
You need to rest, oh! Bou Said
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
I'm celebrating my retirement.
A coffee pot and some dates, how wonderful.
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry because of the khonafrush, oh! Bu Saeed
Don't worry.
Khanafروش is ready
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the khanfroush is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
This is your chance to introduce him today.
He told me that their manager would travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't want to move until
Send it with someone else.
You are now officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
"Thank you very much, Oh! Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye."
Congratulations to me.
No more work.
This means you're free, Dad.
Alright, please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahara is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brings a cake.
I can't.
I myself sent my father to get some papers done for me.
Zahara is going to be annoyed.
Okay, Mom.
My father left work.
God helps him now.
He has worked enough, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khonafrush.
I've prepared it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
You've tired this old man.
As soon as he returns,
He was tired.
Do not grieve me concerning them (by singing).
Do not grieve me concerning them (by singing).
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said he would punish anyone who was late.
Sure, my love.
Go to your work.
On this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you somewhere every day.
As you wish, Umm Saeed.
It smells.
It's in my nose.
Khanafروش Khanafars
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, dad, take it to the market branch.
And go there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and then they tell me it's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
The sun beat down.
I entered our neighbors' house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what the problem was.
What drives you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat the khanafrush now.
Mom, where's Dad?
Round trip
What bank does he go to?
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, does he feel better?
I slept a little, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you this in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
They are poor, Mother Saeed.
They must adhere to their duties, and they will be evaluated. What can they do?
As you like it.
Father of the Hawk
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How did this happen?
In the past, in the past,
Misery is written for me.
Your children have become adults.
I'm obliged to help them.
They used to tell me
You are wrong.
Do you think that all young people without a father don't accomplish their personal tasks?
That depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to leave to finish your personal business.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin? Oh!
I'll finish some papers for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, the one next to the cafe.
I'll take him to the Land Offices.
Goodbye
What's wrong, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later. Bye.
This won't do you any good.
I warn you.
I heard you say this to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He keeps silent.
And what he's talking about
You've tired him out, fear God.
Your very loud screaming woke me up.
Dad, I was a government employee and you know well what hoarding means.
And they write this first.
And now they are %pw, doing this.
Tomorrow is the last day to submit loan applications at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Alright, my son.
I believed his lies.
He says he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong?!
%pw, as you like
Go now to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He has been silent since he returned home.
What comes back to me.
You don't have a shred of decency.
I wouldn't blame your father if he got upset with you.
If you agree to this matter.
Many thanks, and may God reward you.
He was supposed to call you.
Why might he call his servant?
You are the dearest to us, our father!
I am grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me teach him a lesson.
From now on, oh! Father.
And relax.
Khanfarosh Khanfarosh (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, Father.
May God reward you with good.
We decided that from now on,
We will prepare our papers ourselves.
Thank you very much, may God reward you, praise be to God.
But please, Dad!
Consider it the last.
I just can't.
Call me now.
Father, I won't go to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, this can't be, you can't disturb the minister, you must leave, even before him.
I won't go to my father, what can I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider the matter closed.
He'll be on his way once you finish Saeed's papers.
Please, Father.
Consider it your last resort.
I'm happy to serve you, Father!
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
Does that mean I have to come back tomorrow to give it to you?
I advise you to return it today.
And if they do not see the papers
You will have to wait for two months.
No, give it to me so I can get him to sign it, then I'll come back to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and ask him to come, just two minutes.
I'll finish it.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Whenever I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He replies that he is with Saeed.
I'm waiting until the end of work.
Alright, man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your children?
Don't you have any children?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Thank you very much.
No use.
I'm going to leave you.
And go to the elderly hospital.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I will write something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
Not my sister, frankly.
Why bother?
I told him never to appear on television or radio.
These conversations about "stopping corruption" have gotten us into trouble.
God guided him to the right path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was far away.
What can I tell you?
I think they named the program MyLas.
Talk to the man.
The person called Khalid Jassim
He told him to stop corrupting.
His colleagues at work heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do that,
He left it.
May God guide him to the right path.
Sorry, I have to go cook now.
Welcome anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and I'm sick of this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that this has happened.
I told you about this.
And what is this, Mother?
And he screamed.
This engagement
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Let's just not talk about this topic.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
That's unfortunate, after all these years, you're firing me.
You're not listening.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, true.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow and criticize public affairs.
Well-informed
We've just laid off a few of them.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, doesn't find out.
He's already mad at you.
Who is the person he will meet?
If he asks you
Tell him that I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Of course
His mother has to say today.
What can we do with him now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
Everything you see on your right
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll sue him to divorce my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
You're beating around the bush unless you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are forbidden to go out.
I know you're very eager for
Go to the café.
Until you talk nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And look for a job tomorrow morning.
If God wills, I will wake up early.
Mom, I've told you, I've gotten rid of this habit.
I swear
Mom, to be honest, I'm feeling a bit bored.
And don't speak illogically.
Act as if you were deaf.
It has changed.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your talks about stopping corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Is Saleh here?
Surely he's sleeping.
Did my son make any mistakes?
We just saw him at the café.
What did he say?
He did the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around us.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If this wasn't your fault,
This is his mistake because he didn't stop you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Whether to speak out or not, or to give talks to stop corruption or not.
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on the radio
Or Saleh stopped corruption.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you are very patriotic.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming. We appreciate it.
Not exactly.
I yearn every day to hear that, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Say it, even just once.
May God bless you, I
Is it a cigarette? Just say stop corruption, please.
He's begging you, give it to him, just once.
This is amazing.
Now, my dear
For the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
We wanted to call you to let you know.
It would have embarrassed you in front of people.
Are you serious?
Everyone said there were no job openings.
They really wanted to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now, how will you save money for you and your mother?
And don't forget that.
She has four children.
God help you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You must look for a job every day.
So as not to upset my father.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
Do you know what he's doing these days?
I told you.
But you, you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him what this guy is doing.
The minister will think.
He will surely think that way.
You are right.
But, this is a serious matter.
We must do something.
They say he's going to replace you. You know such a rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind it.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests is
Have you heard about Saleh who stopped corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He will take care of that.
We miss your voice.
No to the benefit
I am a big fan of yours.
Salih is a very good man.
And we hope that this will happen soon.
He will return, and we will enjoy listening to his voice.
Even Bou Fahad himself asks about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you resign?
I was suffering from some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are diligent.
I haven't heard from him in a long time.
How beautiful, please reconcile
Just this once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about that.
Salih says he agrees.
No, folks, it's really tough.
What's wrong?
The man is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I had already resigned.
Didn't you tell us you were looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Flatter him and let him hear your voice, and go ask him for a job the next day.
He will definitely hit you.
I want what's best for you.
Do you know what?
Forget about it, go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Okay, bro, wait a minute, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay.
Fine, if I had spoken for the last time now, I would resign, but I'll do it one last time.
What does Bu Fahd want to hear?
What is the problem that worries him the most? As you know, there are many problems here, more than you imagine.
What does he like to listen to? Or does he like to listen to chaos, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
The bear is eighty-eight centimeters tall.
He's ruining it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is number seven? Seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Case seven, the minister.
Why did the officer act?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
Bring your brother's cars.
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, we'd like you to stay in touch with the program.
"We are a dear people, which means this is the last time."
Because, frankly, I had resigned.
Mom, didn't you say he resigned and you fired him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The person called "Stop Corruption" was talked about on the radio.
What I heard, people just told it to me.
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
Get rid of it.
He is free.
Well, Minister
Don't worry.
I dedicate my entire day to serving the ministry, God bless you.
Did you hear that?
I said this to you only.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdurrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Bu Fahad's secretary.
And I know the case.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached that.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all of that.
Bu Fahad will never hire you.
You'll do the same thing to him.
As long as you're known.
No one will hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow to get a divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't do that.
We don't have any problems.
We are happy.
What is nepotism?
Everyone stands in line.
Because that's the system here.
He takes more rights than a foreigner.
We do not rely on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your effort and work make you the best; we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And they will expel you.
We don't have this here.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Known for stopping corruption.
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running, and Adoul grabbed my shirt and tore it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Walid saw me wearing the shirt we bought from Villaggio earlier.
He pulled it jealously and tore it to pieces.
He is kind-hearted, he cannot blame.
I think
You, Adol, saw my child handsome, so you envied him.
This is not within his purview.
Why did you tear Walid's shirt?
I saw him wearing a new shirt and started to feel jealous, ask your father to buy you a new shirt.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you
Don't make me hit you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you give him another punch in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little child, not your age, be ashamed a little.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to raise and fix him.
Not just the left.
Be careful what you say, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, to fix me.
You are arrogant.
Raise your child well.
And if you are unable to do that
I respect him.
I don't want to scold him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adol hits Waleed again,
I'll punish him.
I'm the one who wastes his time arguing with you.
Act politely.
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools.
Where are the days that have gone?
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger size than this?
No, no, this is the biggest one.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the problem we're facing.
Oh, my dear, please tell me what happened.
My brother Ahmed, sorry, I have to go home. I have something important and I must go.
Adoul's pants are missing.
This is a hateful and bigoted person.
This... It's Sultan.
How will the child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I did not use them, God is sufficient.
I'll show him.
Sit down and listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't admit it, he'll say it's the child.
So, what should be done?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my beloved
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
Just tell me.
Where did you put the scissors, dear?
Under his bed.
They destroyed it, may God destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
He is crazy, mentally deranged.
Currently
And do not change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show it to him.
I will not be silent.
Do you think our son Adoul is the one who broke their computer?
Ask him to come, let's see who is behind this.
No *
Go and mock someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you it's Advil.
And laugh at someone else, oh! Tigers, not me.
I live, please come.
Where hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm going to go look for friends.
Laughing at, not with me, oh! Sultan!
Falsely accused
Hold this pair of scissors.
Act politely.
Hello, Abdel Rahman, come quickly, boy!
Come and see your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, my son!
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We must be.
Let's carefully examine our actions.
And the works of those who preceded us
Yes, we see that.
We will have a lesson.
We must learn from them.
Don't behave like children this way.
Its size is like that of a camel.
You have children.
Without any knowledge
You are a role model for him, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, oh! Sultan
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
For me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
I shook his hand.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
"Abdulrahman's endless talk"
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you make this tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Didn't you say that Abdulrahman had made peace with you?
Seriously, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him. Just hold the tea.
On his head
Quiet, quiet, stop, oh! The boys, they have no shame, hitting each other.
You're acting like little children, stop it, oh! My son.
I swear I'll show you.
Hit, hit, oh! My son, that was a hard hit.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your shouting.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
This is a flaw.
And if I have made peace between you two.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile them
He didn't have time, oh! My daughter.
Poor thing.
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
But, oh! Girls
May God guide you.
You must calm them down.
Don't incite them to fight each other, girls!
What happened? I hope it's something good.
You've disappointed me, oh! Abdul Rahman
I wanted you to help me, not do the same thing.
You are my wise brother, may God guide you.
Two consecutive strikes.
*Stretch your arm*
You've embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Oh! Officer, we've told him again and again.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Sorry
No *
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
This means it's too far away.
My brother was right when he said that it was a mistake.
I'm sorry, since you've signed that your children won't do it again,
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome!
The officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is he the Assistant Under-Secretary?
The person in the middle is the head of a public body.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
O Allah, protect us from the evil of our enemies.
O Allah, protect us from the evil of our enemies.
God protect us from the enemy, they have exhausted me.
"What is this?" "What percentage?"
Even a child can throw that far!
This is an adult's hand, and it looks like his father's hand.
Do you believe that?
He seems to be from a respectable family, and he is kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what's the matter?
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say you didn't get the chance.
When I passed by her, she looked at you, what does that mean?
Just a coincidence, I think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same time.
No, but there's definitely something.
I noticed that when I entered.
She feels happy, deep in her heart.
Go ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than you should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly, speaking frankly
It's been a long time since we sat and chatted like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you need to go rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, the horses too. I told the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, and no contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
May God help you.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have his friend's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has now been sold, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and filming.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, and we will not interfere.
Good morning, uncle.
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every few minutes.
The problem seems to lie with the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May Allah reward you with the best reward.
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, tomorrow I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough already, man.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighbors are more important than the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
To make my colleagues believe me
He couldn't believe our house was right next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's.
Speak, that he may believe.
What a life!
What we used to see on TV
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor, praise be to God, has become grateful, thank God!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but oh! People, be gentle with me, I'm not used to it yet.
I heard about him.
That was very kind of him, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
The reason is that the transfer of some employees to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan has been confirmed.
Did they tell you who's moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But what I heard and I'm sure of is
Is Bouali among them?
My name!
But we don't know exactly who the people are that we'll be transporting.
I can't go, God bless you, the smoke is too far away for me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, the work is the work, man.
The committee is still considering this matter.
But if they choose you.
Thank you for visiting me, oh! Bou Walid, come in.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Please excuse the old furniture.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
"This is kind of you. Oh! Boy, Walid"
May God reward you, Abu Waleed!
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I'm ready to stroll through the market for you until you find the most beautiful furniture that suits you at low prices.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We must change it.
Inshallah
I've told you this before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
I can never cry for you (like that).
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it tires you.
No more.
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, and we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Just wait a moment.
Just wait a moment.
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her on my behalf.
I told you.
No, don't worry, Mother.
And you'll come and ask me to propose to you.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
So, who is the owner of this car?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people, they love charity.
Yes, you're right, Dad!
Even our relatives won't do that for us.
Sure! Is my name there?
Are you sure?
What a nuisance, why do problems keep chasing us?
I don't know, I'm confused now after hearing this news. What am I going to do? I don't know.
Go, go, go, go, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What happened? Oh! Bou Ali
The committee met today.
And the list of names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Umm Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he said it's impossible.
Famous actor
Consider your name was never on the list.
God bless you, thank you very much, oh! Bu Salem
If you don't mind
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Sure, God bless you.
Come please, come.
Sure, I'd be happy to help.
You and those you love
Let me know a day or two in advance.
Mother, be ready.
Are you ready? Ready for what?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
She said, "I have no objection."
Let her mother come.
Go to them.
But, good heavens! My son.
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You must be fashionable.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You've put me in a bind.
Why are you wearing all this jewelry? I've never seen you do this before.
This is not mine.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali will suggest marriage to her son.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewelry.
You want to show them that they are wealthy and affluent people.
(Surprise) God willing
She is lucky.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and more *blue*.
Listen, God willing.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You also need to be prepared.
They will ask you to meet her father.
I'm sure I won't go in this outfit.
When I'll enter with my new clothes
Mother, be careful with her belongings.
It's a kind gesture from Waleed's mother that she gave you her belongings, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
Therefore, we must be like them to me.
Why didn't his mother go to arrange his marriage?
That was for the women.
I have to go and meet the men.
As you can see, God bless you.
Only the bisht is left, God bless you.
Good people, help me.
They were cooperative, but the cloak is what's left.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
All the people stand with you.
Oh, brother Rashid, should I let it go like this, or hold on to it?
No, look, first.
You need to button this up.
It's preventing me from breathing.
The garment (male cloak) is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand must be inside.
The right hand is relaxed, like that.
You're holding the bisht from the bottom.
Wow, wow
How wonderful this is
You should slow your steps a bit.
Oh! PW, yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand, like this, your left hand, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's in it?
Do you know what she was telling me this morning?
She told me this because you are my friend and I don't want us to be distant from each other.
I'll ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask his sister for anything and not to embarrass her or himself.
I see that there are many suitors interested in you these days. A few days ago, Souad told me she wanted you for her uncle, and today this girl wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
While I just sit and watch
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Okay, then.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
You reject my son Waleed.
Actors are more sincere than you, two-face! Oh!
But you,
You behave your whole life.
This doesn't reflect your personality.
To serve people
Deceiving people
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while performing on television.
Me or you!
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
To play
To get married
Any scene
A man walks in front of his wife.
He puts the ghutra (traditional Arab dress) on the sides of his face.
He doesn't look right or left, even if he's dead.
He reminds me of your friend you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why does he walk like that?
As they said,
God helps him, man!
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality whatsoever.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the shape of the city center.
No, no, no, no, that doesn't look good when you sit.
You look better when you wake up, when you stand, stand, stand.
I beg you, Thursday!
What's up, are you going downtown?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
Are you happy about that!
Oh! Thursday
I turn it on, and if the announcer is a woman...
I'm changing the channel because I'm afraid it might get me into trouble.
I swear to God I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
Talk to her.
She hung up on me, take it, take it.
She hung up the phone, and now she's going to bother me.
You're saying now that I let you talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you might throw me out of the house.
I'll fire you!
You're not the first person to get fired.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! Brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
"He appointed me" or "He delegated me"
She said, "Don't shoot."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Wasalem, in particular, is one of the best men in our town.
He is asking you to divorce him.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, am I stupid enough to divorce him? This is unbelievable.
Khamees, I've officially gone crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
Poor thing, it's sad.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
"Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?"
No, no, nothing, nothing.
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
This is about meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm really talking to you consciously.
Oh! My brother.
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we remove your name?
The only person who can remove your name is the Honorable Minister.
This is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Hello Hello Hello
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safe and sound, I swear to you it was safe.
If you're talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lie doesn't work.
Don't lie! Oh! Five.
Won't you tell the truth?
You are wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
What a miserable life.
God bless you, please contact Salam.
Please, in order to believe.
You were asked to call.
This is none of your business.
Don't interfere in others' affairs, or you'll face something unpleasant.
They complain about you.
Hello?! Hey, you!
How can you bear to live with a woman who has such a sharp tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan went to call Thursday.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's begin.
Let's hope he finds it.
He felt terrified when he saw the ladies.
I've searched the whole ministry and you're hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh! Thursday, how will you recognize your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
*Oh my God*, do you want to doubt me? Don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get back home?
Will your wife call at this hour?
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which your company will implement for our ministry
It is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh! People, why is the table shaking?
No, a long time ago, not the table, but me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that his wife said not to come home unless you change your job and stop working with ladies.
That's why I sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he agreed to it, what does he want!
What's wrong with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him who you are talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What are you going to do! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you've done what she wants, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, that's what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
Until you see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And I hope we agree, and if you agree, I will go back home tonight, God willing.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
Any office and position other than the one he was working in.
Where is this section, may God bless you?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister's statement.
Nothing, nothing, it's that, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdul Qadir, God willing, it's a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a ride?
The entire department is made up of women.
My wife
No one can execute another's decision except the minister himself.
You must work until the minister returns.
Oh! Brother, agree with your colleagues.
And address them by masculine names, so that your wife will not know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee, he is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office referred a man to work with us.
Are you serious!
It looks funny, poor guy, working among five women, it looks funny.
They say his wife is extremely jealous of the other women around him.
Blind jealousy
Poor him, he's in need.
But he asked us to remain silent when his wife called, and we complied and did not speak.
Ah, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
***** See if it fits you.
My son called me and said that my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Walk straight ahead, it's the first floor on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With the fifth ***
These are six employees.
And these are here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of other women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
May God guide you, Sultan.
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
My uncle, Falcon, and I were at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and ready to go out.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And the scorpion's bite is painful.
This is important for rain, look look
Wait, uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
So the meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must implement that.
They must realize that you are an important supervisor.
They have many responsibilities and obligations.
They consider women as servants.
I haven't seen people who hate women like them.
What age do they think they're living in?
They asked me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the maids?
And the second one escaped a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their mistreatment.
I understand them.
May God help you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Uncle, they mean by that.
In fact, a villa complex without a garden is valueless.
Okay, now, the park...
Sister, before you go out, I want to talk to you about something.
My beloved Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And run it at school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
Do you know that if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You are the one who deserves the blame.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? It's been a long time since I last saw you.
It's been a year now, a year since I've seen you.
Is he married or not?
Oh, may God guide you.
Who would agree to marry an ignorant woman without an education?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if my mother is a man.
And Khamis is the son of Al-Aqrab.
The scorpion's sting is painful.
He must also marry someone of the same social status.
A scorpion like him.
God help you.
What can I do, Aisha!
Ever since the minister traveled, all the papers have been sent to me.
I informed Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet with him the day after tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
You have the schedule.
I'm free to talk to you now, Aisha!
Yes, Mary.
Okay, place, okay, place now.
What can I say, Aisha Oh!
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
No problem, my dear. Ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
Didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about this?
I went to them, so they beat her.
Would you tell them it's soccer?
They would have beaten you a long time ago.
How embarrassing, you play soccer!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The Big Scorpion
This little one
Oh, come on, Uncle, I didn't hit her, it was Sultan who hit her.
Did you hear that?
I had chosen economics and political science.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's not your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't be greedy.
Well, scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the Scholarship Department.
And cross out architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Saqr.
They have no objection to Manira getting married.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves the very best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to be part of the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Frankly,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination came from the minister.
He is right.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I'm surprised.
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
And I take care of the house expenses.
She wants me to travel with her too.
Aren't we going to marry her this week?
What are you saying?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
Done, let's go.
This is a shame.
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh! My son, I've told you that several times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
It doesn't matter, as long as he is the son of scorpions.
Appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
Go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
The Madrid and Barcelona match will be tonight.
I hope we don't lose to Valencia.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and hardworking in her job.
What do you think about this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
Long life
Serve coffee there.
Happiness
May God grant her a long life.
Hello, may you live long.
Good evening, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
Yes, may you live long.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We're going to play in China after tomorrow.
Oh captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
Going to the official engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything in life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw.
Yes, ma'am.
Pour it and make a new one.
Actors' Calls
You know, Mashael also called me a few minutes ago.
What could I say to her?
That's unfortunate, Danah's role isn't suitable for Mashael.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
It seems that Mishaal is in her twenties.
Well, why doesn't she play the role of Mary?
This suits her better.
"Nouf for thirty"
We must get rid of the complainer on the committee.
He's a troublemaker, and I'm sure he won't let things go smoothly.
He is a precise person.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, and so on.
Who did you choose for that committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamed can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that it belongs to us.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company was registered in the name of Hamed's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, please come in.
I just spoke to them and agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
It is produced by the Modern Touch Institute of Arts.
It's a beautiful, unusual, and bold action series.
I agree with Hamed.
The story of the series is very beautiful.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And she didn't know he was her son, it was exciting, and when the police arrived
And her son came back from school.
Throw a box.
So he kicked it and the ball flew into his mother's window.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
It's good that a local company is producing this advanced level of products.
We should encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and thoughts on the series, this is "blackmail of the conscience."
Blackmail and human values
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people per episode
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without any social awareness.
Does not carry a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why must you make the audience cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You've given us your opinion, Ali gave us his, now let Mr. Rashid express his.
This is clear from the meeting.
That there is an agreement between you.
I've organized it.
Some people understand, as it's their field, while others have no relation to this field.
I don't agree with this series.
I'm afraid it will get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Ms. Samira.
I don't know what to do.
I can't believe this! Oh, Nasser!
This is for the new series we will be producing soon.
What makes a driver rape your daughter?
For the blessings we have received through it.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
That's why they present it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to protect them from behind.
He owns a five percent share of the production.
This is a beautiful role.
I've played a similar role before, didn't you watch "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called blackmail or something like that, I can't remember.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
Last year, all the TV series were about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight girls, or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are very beloved.
You're lucky.
Yes, Omar.
Yes, yes.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Eat and walk.
He said he wanted to see me about a very urgent and important matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And I told him that you would create problems for him.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and they want to meet me.
And I also fear that the minister will believe his words.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to clarify his viewpoint regarding the series.
This is all.
This is true, I wish you a longer life.
But I would like to say first, Mr. Minister, that it is unacceptable to talk about a colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He's jealous of everyone around him.
He cares only about financial gain.
But that's his specialty.
But, God bless you, not every educated person can handle these technical matters.
Television production in particular
Conscience blackmail, the series we're working on.
It's a massive production.
We will launch a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your field of expertise. You know more about this subject than I do.
I promise you an amazing series.
This is what will defend our reputation.
See what the journalist Abdulhamid wrote, listen listen.
Also, one of the actors said
That the series promotes unethical ideas.
Confined to the decline of morals.
This is indeed a bold and powerful critique.
They will face a big problem if journalist Abdel Hamid continues writing about them.
And if the people I accuse are aware of it?
But they are smart and know how to handle it.
They are a gang.
We need to create our own website.
Put all our company's activities on it.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you're the media advisor.
The series "Extortion of Conscience" supervised by Mercury Media Production is considered
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries ideas and moral values.
This series aims to develop society.
He is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept that?
Journalist Abdel Hamid and his likes
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me what I thought of the series, I told him it would be the best in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel our series will be a hit.
I don't know where he is.
The other is packed and ready to go.
An uninteresting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
It's clear at first glance.
Your book is stupid.
That might happen.
Your show is stupid, ridiculous.
What do you think?
This is very tragic.
Other bad series are no excuse.
This production can be understood at first sight.
These are subtle lines and dimensions, you need someone focused to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It's a pity that he was seen.
What's the problem?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is upset, that's a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be separated.
The TV series is a total failure, everyone who watched it said it was a flop.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the series is a failure and contains no events.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Ellie, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't make me sad.
I'm sorry.
I was on vacation that day.
I'm never going to let them write that.
But honestly, I didn't receive any message praising me.
Once again, great success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Blackmail is the best TV show.
May you live longer, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they have an agreement with the viewers' page as well?
I almost had a heart attack.
After a while, they told me.
You're lucky, the minister is satisfied.
Frankly, Nasser,
Be ready to watch the second part of the series Blackmail of Conscience.
No, no, no, no, enough! Oh! My brother,
The series, he said he would not write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Problems
And a third and a fourth as well.
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
I am here
What can a wizard do?
I wish you more success.
Please let us know what you think about this success.
I thank God for this success.
They are haters and enemies of our success.
I find this strange.
That this series wins awards despite being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They awarded him prizes, for they surely see what we cannot.
Prepare the second part of the series.
Alright, I wish you a long life.
A real wizard.
You'll see, "conscience blackmail" will happen.
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie as well?
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
This is the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to wash and become clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch.
They nominate it in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it, award it, and even consider it high-class.
Yes, that's right.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your arrival.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't reduce it.
Otherwise, we will terminate the contract.
We have already signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company.
Women's World Cup
As you like it.
He did a great job.
He will be the first person in the world to produce this product.
He is not just the best bread baker in the world.
I'll tell you.
How can bread be with (sosta)?
Open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and it might cut your hand.
So he made bread using a zipper.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, it's pants.
So what do you think, in fact, it's a bag of bread.
How can we remove this zipper?
If that's the case, one could say to their friend: "I ate two zippers."
Why weren't the Light Mountains Hospital pastries delivered yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you deliver it yesterday?
The bakers who make it.
Once again, use the bakers.
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
Okay, what's the problem if he takes some company employees along to enjoy themselves?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven main players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you angry with him?
But this is good for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, they are the twelfth player.
I let you enjoy yourself with them.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When I first told you he wanted to play soccer.
I've been listening to you.
Didn't do anything
No, you're only angry at him because he took some employees to play football in front of him and enjoy themselves.
I didn't say he couldn't take some employees.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend them some.
Important bakers
Yes, my son, why do they take the important bakers, this cannot be.
Next time, inform me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi do these papers.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they tell you?
I finished work, and as I was getting into my car
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find a goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
He told us to find a goalkeeper, and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's outfit.
I didn't play soccer, nor did I even touch the ball.
This situation
This is stupid.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
Let me explain to you.
Father, you want me to disband the team and let them go, don't you?
Yes, that's correct.
Alright, Dad, please, I beg you.
I can't let the team down, tomorrow's the final.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations to Mr. Nasser on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked very hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party as promised.
It seems your father is happy.
I'm afraid he's just nice and polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, firstly, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
This immense success
God bless you, no, no, no.
No picture without a bisht, wait, wait, stop.
No, no
He is wearing a bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative input have played a significant role in achieving this success.
And the coach's plan
But they played a 5-5-3-2 formation in the final.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet Baker's team wasn't confused and did a great job.
And the coach's plan
As the first athlete of the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest the players do, Bo Nasser?
To infinity
Hello hello
Longevity
They are welcome. Is Hamad Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, oh! Abu Abdulaziz
This is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still small.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
Deputy Manager of the engines we use in the factory
Do you see?
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
It was football that introduced me to him, and I told him so.
I said to him: Oh! Abu Abdulaziz
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
What's his relation to you?
The ball was always close to me, there were only fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser arrived yet?
No, he didn't show up today either.
At a seminar on football injuries, as the platinum sponsor, he should be present there.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we strive to meet and interview a prominent figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
As for the International Bakery Team, we heard that you're undergoing a comprehensive overhaul.
Compared to offices, all efforts made
It's a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
Don't be stingy, man.
It's not my fault, brother Shahin.
This is my mistake.
So what mistake did I make?
What you told me you need players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices are the highest ever.
This means that if the player's price is two thousand,
For the bay, the cost ranges between three and four million dollars.
I didn't understand, explain it to me.
Receive fax here
And read it to me when you have it with you.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily defeat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it says eight hundred thousand on it.
Yes, that's right. May God bless you, but it was a Turkish club that set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we examine the goods?
He is here.
Leg muscle
This is good, okay.
No, no, no, I guarantee it to you.
He is fat, God willing, it's good that he is fat.
This is slim, and it's suitable for the middle.
The intercostal muscle
It is the most important muscle, the player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Let your driver take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did I say! Automatic
How did that happen?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yes, we bring them from African forests.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
"You're welcome to take it. Do you have a place to put it, or should I take it with me in the pickup truck?"
When he saw them putting pressure on us
The forward player was asked to play.
No one can escape their destiny.
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I like his style of managing the game.
This should be on the way to the north.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you screaming?
Your stupid son
He is not convinced that the coach is not an expert in football.
Listen to her; she talks just like Mitsu.
He knows that the attacking player Selulu Tekawawa is a good midfielder, as Ahmed Tayeb said.
No one's going to give you a headache.
Just stay away from me.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose their home game?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
And player Takulamakakolalalu is out of position and should be moved to his usual spot.
Ask the coach to change ...
Dismissal of Hopway Malalo
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This is not supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these issues until the game is over.
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Team Success, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This coach is wrong.
He says, Uncle Bu Nasser doesn't want you anymore, he has coached his team.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you'll stay as a reserve player, do everything I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough! Oh! Rashid
What's wrong? You scared me, tell me what's wrong?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
I divorced you! How did this happen?
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You weren't married for even a month.
I don't know, Mother. I really don't know.
He divorced you without any reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me to go to my parents' house.
I asked him why this? He told me, "You're divorced."
I swear to God, I don't know what's going on?
They were married for only a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he divorced her, and that's on you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
They humiliated Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she had insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to this team and respects it.
And I insulted him and hurt his feelings.
My mother told me she insulted Barcelona, so I said to him, "Divorce her and I'll find you another wife."
To tell him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Just for that reason, he divorced her. Are you serious?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife questions her husband's loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time, he started mocking Messi.
Problems arise between couples, and we must address them.
Instead of one girl, there are a thousand girls.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'll be upset with you.
Don't tire yourself, my son, and don't think about the subject.
Instead of one girl, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Alright, my love.
What's wrong with her?!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for one month?
If I told you her story and the reason for her divorce, you wouldn't stop laughing.
We want your attention so we can involve you.
What's the use of such a person? He divorced his wife for a football team.
The hairdresser knew them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to have problems with that person.
That's all, you're listening to hairdresser's nonsense.
Tell them I didn't agree.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming to her.
I told her: "Girl, don't stop your luck, oh!"
If it's only her luck, I don't care at all.
But she will stop her fortune and ours with it.
This building
He won't say no to me.
God save us from the evil of this bad barber.
They listen to a rumor and then spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand not to close the door of luck that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You must be joking. Do you think he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all these trivialities and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And perhaps she was the cause or there was something wrong with her that led him to divorce her.
Listen, girl! Don't let Abu Borgain slip through your fingers.
What's this, Abu Burgin?
But when they get closer, they discover that they are two towers.
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Borgin.
May God bless you.
No, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God grant you a long life, they already took the money, I signed and they spent the money.
Minister, you seemed preoccupied and very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, he divorced her.
He was also married and divorced his wife.
Ah, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, Oh! Brother, be firm with him.
Oh my God! Man, this is a tough generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter!
My daughter, don't forget your coat, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when boarding the plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Come on, son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mother.
Alright, that's fine.
So you can come with us and do some shopping as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's happening?
You did the best thing by ignoring her.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, you're supposed to be taken care of in every way.
Is it logical that she sits while you pour the water?
The glass is next to you, and it doesn't hold you back from drinking.
She didn't receive a good education.
You should have told her that since the day I was born, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's in it?
You look very sad.
And who is this lady with her?
Her name is Michelle.
Poor thing, she got divorced during her honeymoon.
Won't you believe me if I tell you her story?
May God bless you! Oh! Thank you, auntie.
Your aunt and aunts requested.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Hello, Mother.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or might except by Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
Frankly, this is nonsense.
So, where is Manira?
She's in her room talking to that fool.
She's saying now that she's been trying to reach him for two days and his phone has been off.
I just found it.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's annoyed? The boy is coming from outside, he's tired, and wants to rest.
I tell my mother every day to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. She makes me angry every day.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin.
She peels the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And again if necessary.
Go, oh! My light.
Go, oh! My light.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still upset!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Be quiet, may God give you health.
I don't know, mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
True, he has nothing to say.
You will dance two or three times.
I'll kill whoever divorces my daughter.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to vent my anger on this man who has no sense of shame.
She has a tail like a peacock's.
Embellished with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are your playthings and your son's.
They don't have families and mothers to feel the bad taste in their mouths.
The person you are mocking.
And divorce them in a lawful manner.
She helped you drink water, she curses Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
The person who went to a nightclub.
Without shame or modesty
Deputy Minister, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his sons.
Stay still and don't move.
Be humane.
It was my father's.
Who would sell land like this?
Abu Sakr took the thing from the father by force.
Why did he sell it?
God guide you, if Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone refuse his request?
Leave it to God, man.
Come in, please.
Come on, come on.
What's the status of your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to manage your project, you need to start paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
%pw What does he eat? Isn't there anyone in this world who doesn't eat?
This is not a problem, brother. We'll let him eat and get full, and we'll fill his stomach. The problem is how we can reach him.
You should know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I meet him in Umrah and greet him more than once.
What you need to know about him is that you're going to pay him and he's going to do your work, all you need is to know the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Oh man! Anyone.
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's really wonderful to stay at this farm overnight.
Yes, sir, I am Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency located behind the shopping center.
He wants to meet you, sir.
Get the license.
This is like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Say yes only, Your Honor.
As a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
My work is going well.
This means you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't be stupid.
Yeah, no problem, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the method is, what did you do?
Circumstances helped me.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a gift, a falcon.
If the subject is about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, take me to him.
Yes, that happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He underwent a tonsillectomy.
He will certainly give a feast.
You deserve your son's health, O honor!
We wish him well, we wish him well, God willing, no harm will befall him, God willing.
We met at the rosary shop.
I think so.
Man! We're starting to forget and get old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the next room and has already left.
Therefore, I thought I should visit you.
I congratulate you on your good health with Shahin.
Oh! Sir, you shouldn't leave without having dinner with us.
I'm not in the mood for this.
Say yes or no only.
Because our beloved son Shahin has left the hospital,
In my Corniche Tower.
Say yes only.
Oh! My son, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a business without capital these days?
He said at the car and bulldozer agency, just let him point to it.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Even in college,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Whatever God wills, your father is loved by all, and you just point to him.
Oh! People take out loans from banks to start a company or business.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Have you opened a pickle shop?
This is also something new.
This is a falcon, the apple of my eye. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
He only took their agency yesterday.
Do you see?
He also told me that all businessmen love me, wish God would make everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
Frankly, I love her.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, Uncle Sakr! Congratulations, congratulations! Oh!
God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it so easily (like that).
You, you can now say no.
So, what's the problem?
What do I need to say?
Be his partner.
Do you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said I was a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I had experience in this field.
I have a bakery, and praise be to God that I can earn my living from it.
No, no, I don't like this name.
What I noticed.
No, oh! Brother, the name is not nice.
Therefore, this is a fitting name for Iranian bread.
Understood, grand prize.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God, O man of honor!
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
She, Your Honor, sent her car for repair and came to take mine because she works as an advertising agent in a marketing company and cannot do anything without a car.
Maybe your car will need it too.
No, no, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent! Oh! Dr. Sami
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study either business or economics.
He has never read a book in his life, not even a newspaper. I've never seen him hold a piece of paper in his hand.
You all know who Falcon is today.
I didn't want him to enter this field, the field of business and %pw, but...
His uncle Abu Nasser is still alive here before you.
Who loves him.
But there are people born for business, and they naturally love business.
You're right, Doctor!
God willing, Shahin, you will be like your brother.
God willing, God is generous (proverb).
But it's still early.
This depends on upbringing.
No one can be like you, oh! Dr.
Be honest.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, manage to easily attain such a great economic sense?
And if there are a hundred billionaires in the world today, they would count him as one of them.
Do you know, Abu Sakr? Oh!
He had chosen Falcon for the market's horsemanship.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Hawk, wants to take over my father's car dealership?
You no longer have the agency.
People are never satisfied.
The father helped his son enter the market.
He was initiated into trade.
Frankly, the doctor said he was in critical condition.
This won't work.
There is nothing that cannot succeed.
I'm shocked or hit, it's none of my business, I'm telling you that you're going to divorce her, divorce her and you should divorce her.
There is a people like this in the 21st century.
We meet, dear viewers, with one of the kind and giving men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the poor and deprived.
So, we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Association.
And of course, if we speak, oh! My lord judge, about this organization,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world and to everyone, of course.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, I seek refuge in Allah.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to provide thirty sacrifices for our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready to deliver.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
All that God wants, oh! Your honor, may God make many people like you.
I just left home with my wife.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to inaugurate her new project.
And I will wait for her.
No problem.
Frankly, I love their company and enjoy sitting with them. I really have a good time.
And also a source of income for my children.
This is all my life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Alright, talk is cheap, talk is cheap.
Let's go, oh! People.
There is a people like this in the 21st century.
There is a people like this in the 21st century.
If anyone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
He needs brave men.
Souq Waqif lives.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you all.
"Masha'Allah, all the youth love you! Oh! Shahin, love is good."
I want to say something, but please say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin must go to the showroom and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
Breezes blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breeze, take me home for love's sake.
Hello, Fadi.
How are you, Anaud?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying the dress would be ready in ten days. Oh! You fool.
And you want your dress beaded with crystals, which takes longer.
And if God wills, you will start talking to Al-Anood and ignore me?
How many Nora do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but about will not be angry.
What else do you need, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't let me forget the matter.
Is my dress ready?
Go ahead, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I'll come next week to get the dress, okay, bye.
How can I assist you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
What God writes, today I went to Fadi at the shop, his work is excellent and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we have achieved great success in this project.
What's the problem?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong?
Look at the jealousy!
We never heard of his starting in business, so where is this bankrupt going to get the money?
She opened her mouth and started looting!
And when he starts his work,
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, you will do nothing?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
Okay, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you,
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these topics, may God guide you, cousin.
Design, women's fashion design, and so on, something like that?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but, I
You need advice, you need %pw I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Thank you, my cousin.
So, forgive me, I must go.
Go ahead, Chief!
The first time you tell me if you need an increase.
So, oh! Fadi, clean the shop, I see you're busy?
The store is no longer sufficient.
You said you would rent the shop next door, so go ahead and take it.
I wish.
Did they rent the shop next door?
Is there anyone else with the name Khalaf Sultan Al-Sayafi besides your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, what's up?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a document at my friend's place. His name is Essam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and his name was written on it.
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong.
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? What's the problem? Is there a flaw in it?
Your sick heart didn't stop you from doing that.
When I saw that my project was successful,
You said I should destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What does he say?
And I was testing you; I asked you if you intended to open a business.
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your requests.
But this doesn't get you anywhere.
Man, this is how livelihoods work and everyone takes their share.
You've defeated me.
Come, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring in a Lebanese designer.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Oh! Madam, this looks wonderful on you, no, no, no, this, this is unparalleled in all of Doha.
Oh, this suits you, madam, and such kind words, the piece that's worth a thousand they sell for thirty and forty thousand.
Yeah, just do the same.
As you know, the wardrobe I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Oh! Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unparalleled in all of Doha.
See, if you want to be successful
What's exactly in it?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place, oh boss.
Don't mention it, don't mention it, oh! Fadi.
By this time, they will have played by themselves.
This means that we were defeated, no!
We must confront them!
That's to get our customers back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have the money to cover the cost?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But more importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress that you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, mine.
And I set it with crystal. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are internationally known.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's the problem? What happened?
They have harmed us, O Sa'd, they have harmed us.
Do they do that?
They killed us; we have no customers left.
This is called war, Abu Nasser!
We won't stand idly by and watch!
We must fight them as they fight us and also respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
And I will start a war against them, and you will see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop this.
Check the ad!
Look at the ad he's posted!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with every wedding dress.
We publish a quarter-page ad.
See, he published a half-page ad.
I have no idea what he was planning to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
No customer had entered their store for six days.
No, and this afternoon they didn't open, they closed instead.
And you will hear that he put his shop up for sale.
I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him.
Even they can't sit there, sit outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea might God guide you to? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is there anyone who bears a grudge against you?
In God's person, bless you, intentionally spray the place with this scent.
And these are the chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are cousins, you are adults and not children to fight like this.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, that's your scent.
Do not cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I've prepared a hell of a plane for him.
Without allowing anyone to find fault with me.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear to God I don't know what's happening; this is the fourth day that no customer has entered our store.
Oh my God, this isn't the shop, we have to go to the other shop, I've uncovered my face, may God guide you.
And what did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers are entering.
I don't know, it's like they did magic to him.
Women and girls do not approach the store.
As if magic had turned Sa'ad into a beast.
This is possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Well, is he asleep or awake?
Go and see it. Oh! Brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will fall.
I lost, oh! Sultan, I lost.
I don't know, turn him into a dog!
He turned him into a monster!
Calm down, brother! Don't get upset.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
Its designer
Not Lebanese.
I told him, didn't I tell him?
Don't you know where he is?
The stars are the same, and we desperately search for those supporting actors.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong, what's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed, oh!
What's wrong with you, Ahmed? You're just sitting here while the manager is yelling at me! What am I supposed to do? Where are those damn extras you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I called him and got a headache, even ask Mr. Abdullah.
First, don't scream. We're actors and we need to relax a bit; we need to focus on our roles. Second, the man has called more than once in front of me, just calm down.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh! Mr. Abdullah, what am I going to do now? The director will end the scene and scream at me.
Alright, guys, alright, guys.
We want to finish, but the additional actors who are supposed to perform in the scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want anyone to shout at you, is that right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is our situation, we've been screaming all morning. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about pretending to be in a scene until God makes it easy for me to find an actor who can play the role well?
It's true that he'll only appear in one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Just please, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if you're not ready today, I'll resign.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
I'll tell you something, there's a Filipino guy, is that okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he'll resign right away. He wants someone like him from the elite, has to be from the elite and from Qatar.
Dude! He'll just put on a gutra and igal, and no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out. This is an insult to people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa has given you all the responsibilities. Distribute the tasks and you'll be at ease.
Calm down, so we can think. Rachel, think with me, you might remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmedi, do you remember someone in Salata neighborhood named Saud with a thorn?
The same as the Saudi bactorn plant.
They say "Saudi cans!"
The manager said he needed a wealthy and respected man, and you say cans.
Dear, at the end of the day, he's just a supporting actor. You'll bring in a wealthy and influential man to play a minor role.
But with a little makeup, Rym became, wearing the bisht and clean thobe and luxurious car.
We hope it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy cans?
So, who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, it's him, it's him.
Yes, it's him, thank you very much.
And now how is it going to work, Mother? There's no other option besides these three pieces that Uncle brought from outside.
My son, you have nothing but what you are wearing.
My son, he's in here inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are waiting outside, what should I iron?
God help you, my son!
This means that I'll be watching you today, and you'll be on TV.
Yes, Mother, they told me I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, failure!
Come on, man. What's this? A spit on you.
Spray, spray.
Here it is, Mother.
Quickly, Mama, are you feeling better?
God willing, my son!
God forbid, I hope they give you some money.
God help you.
Pray for me.
I'm bringing you Saud's cans and Saud's laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abboud, the son of Fatima, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will he act out the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, he'll do a good job. Calm down and be quiet, so they give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is doing.
She is not the same person who used to collect the pachysandra as she did before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You're wearing glasses now.
You are now an old man.
You don't change, I'll regret nominating you.
The actor who played the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
He's here, they've brought him, you are welcome, you are welcome, you are welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Ghafel Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager asks you to do.
Oh! My brother Oh! My brother Please, you're going to play the role of one of the elite, one of the wealthy, right?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is a trivial person, the role needs a serious person.
Everything is acceptable from some people.
Ask me why I speak this way.
My brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen to me, I'll take you to the makeup room now and I'll rehearse you for the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you are here, come in, come in.
The director, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he will clean everything, he will fix it.
Let's repeat that again, the assistant manager is here to meet you and assure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a renowned merchant.
Are you saying this?
Yes, yes, I'll tell you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect this from you. Oh! (Abu Abdul Aziz), say you're Abu Abdul Aziz.
For our rights.
Beautiful, and you should know it!
Let him clean my teeth, oh! Brother.
He will clean and complete the full name: Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Al-Marzooq, Lovely.
Beautiful, go ahead, go ahead and think about it.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't trouble yourself with the reason he divorced her.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She's beautiful, be reasonable and think of yourself, we're not getting married.
Why don't I spit on him?
Great, you're amazing and have memorized everything, amazing.
Let %pw clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh man! The homeowners surprised us; they need the hall, so the director decided to finish the hall scenes and then shoot the exteriors later.
How is that? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed until later. They'll film another scene, and we'll be behind them, God willing.
Do you want me to ask them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
Good morning, Judge.
Hello, which tribe do you belong to, boy?
My name, Your Honor, is Salem Abu Shwe Shwe.
Grilling is popular.
You deserve it.
This tickles me, my nose is big and lips can be here too.
Tell me, my brother! People with high noses are now,
I hold myself back.
If it were someone else, he wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mother.
My mother is very sick, I must go quickly, Oh! My brother!
You'll go with these people wearing these clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, very sick, he says!
Listen to me, you can go like this, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't leave the site.
Alright, alright, I'll try to find a taxi. Oh! Brother.
Which taxi? If you tried to look for a taxi for a year, you wouldn't find one.
You know we're renting the car for the scene.
Take it while it's stopped.
Oh! Brother, please give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
He is in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Wait, wait, I'll get a wheelchair now, now. Oh! My old man.
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Is he inside the car?
Oh! My son, what happened?
Be quiet and don't speak, just look while you're silent.
Peace be upon you.
Nothing's wrong, but my mom, your wife, has asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to bring the bed.
Alright, alright.
Don't bother.
God save you, what have you done?
Okay, oh! Rashid.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashood.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
And I will take Mr. Rashid and do what is necessary for him.
This is what is expected of you.
I'll ask the nurse to come and see what you'd like to drink, sir.
Come with me, Mr. Rashood!
Sorry.
What am I going to do? There are too many people, just wait!
The problem is that no one takes care of us.
Sir, what would you like to drink, tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first, we have a security guard in the hospital who married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
No woman gives me any attention.
They philosophize and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate. I don't want your mother. What's this, I don't want your mother! Go and look for your friends.
Oh! Brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I love her.
If she ignores you, find someone else.
Oh, I can't! Brother, my heart is attached.
Your brother has fallen in love, can you believe it, when I see her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong?!
Go now.
God damn you.
Your Honor, our aunt is now in good health.
You are a professional actor, Saud. Guys, it's your turn now!
Bravo, see how they applauded you and how they praise you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh! Man, forget about it, come and sigh for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget about this topic and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Falah Marzouq, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
Just one buffet!
I did two.
I even heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so stylish, I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mother.
I must bring them something on the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's wrong, Mother?
Look at your brother who will bring shame upon us!
Oh my god, this is embarrassing, by the way it's cheap.
But this depends on our budget, which is a success.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make a mockery of us.
It's good that I saw him.
This type is the free category, dedicated to the upper class.
Above average.
No, we want something extraordinary, something no one can afford.
I'm sorry, my lady, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities (like me).
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with a credit card.
What luxury, very advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I am at your disposal, I am at your service.
He's coming to you.
They booked the small ballroom and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What she said about the Al-Said wedding,
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
My dear sister,
He's only concerned about money.
He doesn't care what people say.
He wants to make a mockery of us.
But we're supposed to bring something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take out loans and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and prevent people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, the cheap chocolate is enough to embarrass us with.
I said the manager liked Chinese food and took it home with him.
Alright, if the bride's family says we choose the ballroom and theater and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, nothing, but the store we went to earlier has a very good price.
By the way, this store designed Abu Dhahb's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Be honest, at least once.
At the wedding of Mr. Mubarak's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't need anything that's been used.
I need a platform that we'll be the first in the world to use.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and up-to-date.
How much does this stage cost with other arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not going to be less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, if we do this, our money won't be enough. Everything is luxurious, everything is the best, everything is excellent, and all of this costs money.
Everyone is doing that.
Please be quiet.
What is the decision?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, no, I need Noah's Ark.
This is the wedding and its costs. By the way, we are considered middle-class.
Do I have to pay 150,000 for the theater and 150,000 for the dance hall, the one you reserved and call the Royal Hall?
I didn't say box, but why the showing off and everyone wanting to see what the other has done and everyone wanting to do better than the other.
It's a battle of egos, and the only ones benefiting are the wedding hall owners.
Those who know that everyone wants to be special exploit us and lie to us.
I swear to God that I know one of my friends who says his brother owns a wedding shop.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for this moment when his father says yes.
Well, do something then.
Like the rest of the young people who get married and manage on their own.
Hello Sheikh, Your Highness.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I'm calling you.
First time in Qatar, designed by the world artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the Solar System.
The play will look amazing with a Noah's Ark stage.
There is no such harmony, you will be the first person in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright then,
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Alright then,
May God give you patience.
As you like it (proverb).
Too many expenses, brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much. Oh! My brother. Oh! Fahd.
How can I fix things? Oh! Fahd, as long as we boast at weddings, we are in trouble.
Without any review.
Of course, you'll get the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we will start with the invitations.
Let our wedding be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the invitation cards my son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their own invitation cards.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, then print it and return. As for Manar's family,
They went to France; even non-wealthy people go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system works this way in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
Frankly, it's expensive, but...
But it's unique and no one has ever done it before.
Sparkle, I don't like it.
Gold would be much better, shiny.
Oh! If his brother can't afford the wedding expenses,
So why are you getting involved?
And leave off all this boasting and boasting at weddings and all these useless expenses.
The only ones who benefit from our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he's leaving, poor thing.
Let me go get it, as no one might be there to take it.
Come, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Oh! Brother, the bride's family should support you.
I tried once, just once.
I said there that there was no need for a ballroom in a very well-known hotel.
Why? We found our daughter on the street, and the others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
Come on, man, these days they're having weddings on Facebook.
Cheaper and less costly.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You'll notice that.
If I don't get Abdullah Roaished or Nawal for my son's wedding.
God damn her, she'll never be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If your son has a Rooshid number, please give it to us so we can contact him.
Alright, dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
Will Umm Nassoor be better than me?
Did you forget who she is and who we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not right, Mom. Look at my brother Saleh, he's breaking my heart and we shouldn't put all this pressure on him.
By God, he broke my heart.
Oh, really!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, she just suddenly fell.
I heard it and fell to the ground.
He had no reason and no one could blame her, after she had prepared everything and people knew, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He will embarrass us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, everything will be alright.
Don't break her heart.
Oh my God! My son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, go and console her.
I swear to God, if I said this to Abu Yusuf, his heart would stop beating.
You know why the minister kept Abu Yusuf until now.
By the way, he was supposed to retire three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong, he's going to help me.
I swear to God, you're crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And it will allow him to hide the papers and statements, until you return the money.
They call that post-poning the cooling-off period.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're afraid.
There's nothing to worry about, and in the end, I'll pay you back, I promised you.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined ones.
Uncle, uncle, I've tried, but there's no other way but this.
If I give it to you and then later give it to the auditors,
They are strict in their scrutiny, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
I ate, I ate the pill.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will be in the dance hall to receive guests.
No, we will definitely be there.
I'm going to throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Alright, dear Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm afraid they might get jealous of you, my son, if you go to them tomorrow dressed like this in your traditional cloak.
So, Mom, is the length of the bisht okay?
The police are here!
I hope there are no mistakes.
Police, just stay here and I'll be back.
God protects you, Salwa.
Forget about your wedding.
Marriage cage, and now he will enter the prison cage.
They discovered the document I hid for your loan, and now they've suddenly found out about me.
Why are you upset!
You'll hear of much greater disasters than this.
What can we say then!
A respectful and honest employee
The ministry contracted a company to carry out maintenance work for those who love their job.
Driven by concern for his job, the employee set out to inquire about the materials.
He discovered that it would cost four hundred thousand.
It will save the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
Punish the minister! No, no, no, I can't believe it.
Why can't you believe it!
This is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He fired him from his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him: Let her work instead of Uthman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that presented the maintenance offer.
It was Uthman who discovered that.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always amazed, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
This is how we've become!
What are you saying!
It has nothing to do with what I'm saying. This poor employee, Uthman, what's his fault!
His fault is that he is honest and loyal!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he just left.
What's happening in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve that, but there's nothing we can do.
This is not fair, Your Honor. He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He earns his living from this job! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister hired,
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to collect his belongings, but I stopped him and said, "Go, and I will send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have changed. Oh! Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will (proverb).
Praise be to Allah, the Most High, the Most Powerful.
The great and generous God, O Uthman, God will not abandon you, goodbye.
What's wrong? Your voice doesn't sound normal!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Any job! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity to visit my mom and bring things for you.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm just asking you.
How dare you go out with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mother!
You're crazy.
People have been liberated, and the world has become a small village. Where do you live!
But what can we say!
Be modern, live this time and don't be backward.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Go, don't look at me and lock it.
Is something wrong? Oh! Saleh, what's wrong with you?
No, you're not fine today.
You shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have an appetite.
So that I can forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The manager is a bit angry.
It is our pleasure, Sir.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That's true, oh! My lord judge.
Tell me, what's the use of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
He is a good-for-nothing.
That's why I want you all.
No place for loyal people and those with outdated principles and values.
If one day you discover
He will have only himself to blame.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have a doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nora doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what is expected of all of you, I don't want it to be like this only, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to choose, you've picked the right thief in the right place.
Enough, oh! Mother Saud, enough, don't torture me anymore.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient against Satan, for he tempted me and made truth seem beautiful to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why did you bother with honesty and loyalty?
You've been a thief your whole life and had an easy conscience.
It's good that I didn't become a virtuous person.
Let me talk to your father.
Never repeat that.
One must be on the straight path, for he bribes, steals, and is hypocritical to live in peace.
The father is imprisoned because all his money is illegal.
Stop him, stop him.
Is this something that can be worn!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it revealed?
You feel no shame, you have no decency.
I'm shy to get dressed, brother.
Are there any shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Is there any respectable lady who wears such a thing?
And will you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I never supported staying here.
I bought her some transparent clothes that she doesn't need.
I'm warning you, if I see you wearing anything below the knee.
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, thank God.
I wish he were a womanizer and evil.
He resembles his father.
As you can see before you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm bad.
How kind this man is. Frankly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
We didn't hear about it until later.
Praise be to God, her reputation is very bad.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
And I returned home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father who doesn't obey his son.
Stop, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, I disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
In short, Father, my father is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Let me introduce you to my friend Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-friend.
Welcome, please come in, it's a great opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians don't cut their nails.
In accordance with the State of Palestine's commitment in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinian fingers.
To find out if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should cut, wound, or draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
Olives, oh human!
We press the olives like this, this is how we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
Forming inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't come to that, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh! Rashid, you must have a strong character.
Now, brother, what's the number of this school where you'll be working tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What character, brother?
But the problem lies in his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
That's enough, brother!
That's why you see him calm.
And then, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we're not talking to you to make you angry,
We're telling you this because this is your last chance.
He told me that I accepted Rashid even though he has a weak personality.
Unwilling and very good.
Whatever the case, he is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
Starting tomorrow,
The new Mr. Rashid.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Alright, forget about it.
From tomorrow,
Yeah, that's good, and what's next?
I'm telling you here:
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Let's assume a boy jumped up and said something like what the other boy said at your previous school, and the inspector was there.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, you'll break the door.
Well, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
I'm telling you here:
I'm nervous.
This is up to me!
Just shut up!
It seems he just told him to shut up!
Did you hear him?
He said that Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said, "I don't care, but he will see, I don't want to see your face here in the class."
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see him?
Teacher, the problem is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting, during break time?
You might find him sitting in the chair area.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
At the end of the day, man errs.
But you shouted in my face!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
My father is abroad and will return next week, and when he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, may God preserve you.
We, we are friends. By the way, blueberry ice cream is very delicious, you might not have tried it. It has a little tartness, but it's wonderful.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I fear is that he will tell his father.
I said his father is abroad.
Yeah, he's out. His dad isn't coming back? That means they took his dad's stuff and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
I carried his bag and brought it to him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
Yes, but what?
It's you who told me that.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh! Rashid!
Name, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't tire yourself, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
That's why I gathered you here, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can anyone guarantee a boy?
This will get us into trouble, it's him, he's calling.
At three o'clock.
This means, hello. The line went dead, I swear he was joking.
Quickly, quickly.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Oh! Teacher, come, come here, oh! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not mocking, oh man, but I'm asking, are you done?
Am I finished or not? Where is the teacher's authority? By this act, you are degrading yourself and degrading the teaching profession.
Alright, alright, good, good.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Expand, expand, we have enough space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
God helps him.
I'm the boss here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
He gave all the teachers extra lessons.
Except for me.
Who's the boss here?
You are the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot on the ground.
What you put on your head, is on the chair. Oh! My brother.
What do you mean?
No need, I swear I'm telling the truth, I want to make things easier for you.
And what do they call it?
So, what are we going to do with you now?
Act better for your own sake, and you will take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go, get out!
Okay, I'll leave.
Whatever you want, we told you, man!
We must put him in his place.
Wait! People, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Saleem!
Oh! Abu Naif, you are the neighborhood leader and you must stop him from crossing the line.
I am not my father's son.
You'll see what I'll do to him.
Quickly, quickly.
Goodbye, Your Honor.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
Do you believe that when he came, I didn't recognize him, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he was promoted a week ago?
This means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what is the secret that got him out of the bottom!
I've been telling you this since day one.
When I'm teaching, I don't want to hear any noise.
Not even a breath.
Act politely.
And you, too, answer me, you, too, argue with me. Get away from my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good staff to work with you.
Therefore, don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the other job, no brother, give me options, different jobs and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear to God, I'm not okay because of the phone call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What will they say, oh Mother, God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister automatically hires his friends and other people.
From this side, don't worry, it was a pleasure to meet you.
They know that I will become a minister.
So, they are bribing me, this is bribery.
Wealth will come to us, a treasure, a treasure will be opened to us.
The big earth.
Come on, let's all go congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Your Excellency.
By the blessing of your honor, we congratulate you.
Congratulations, Ambassador. You deserve it.
You deserve it, oh! Your Excellency the Minister.
Oh! Brothers, the responsibility is great, may God help us bear it.
As they say, you are more than qualified for this job (figuratively speaking).
She left after Abu Saleh's phone rang.
That was far from him.
Forget him.
I'm surprised how he loves him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've accomplished a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were coffeehouse stories, coffeehouse stories.
After her husband's death, she said that I was jealous of him.
I seek refuge in God, I seek refuge in God.
Yeah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, I'm tired of this situation.
What do you mean by "It's none of your business"?
All you have to do is relax.
I cut them off because they made me feel anxious.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say this in front of my mother, because you know how mothers are, she'll tell everyone.
She says anything she hears, they call her the sieve, we don't want a scandal.
So, what guarantees do you have that if he steps down from power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked for it.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What assures you that they will fire him?
No, I'm very sure about this.
No problem, I saw him outside the office just like I see you now in front of me.
You're going to bewitch him.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
It's the burn and kick plan.
I'll make him attend every event that happens in the country.
By that time, he will be burned out, and when he is burned out, he will be relieved of his duties. And when he is relieved of his duties, he will be fired.
I swear to God, brother, I don't know how or what to tell you!
Your visit, it's called a participation that reflects how much you love your country.
Do you believe that?
You are a statesman today, and you must always be present.
You must participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come on, Sir, it's just a sheep, it's not worthy of your status. What do you think, Sir, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am sick of awe, I am sick of it.
You are a minister today, and he is right. As he said, you are a social figure, so make a prestigious position for yourself!
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take pictures of me.
Take, take.
I took him today to a poetry evening and to a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll also tell you about something very nice you can take him.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I'm looking for that glitter.
Seller, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, picture, oh happy pasha. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take a picture of me, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Excellency greets you.
Picture, picture like this. You are fat, fat sir.
"No problem, God bless you."
Go to page two.
No, he doesn't know him.
It's a national participation.
Say, "What Allah wills."
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid describes you as active in the field of social work.
I heard a hurtful word yesterday.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
Children's swimming victory party.
There was a person telling his friend a story.
They thought I didn't hear them.
He said that this minister
I want to buy a birthday present for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
Correct, correct,
You brought light when you came to this place, I'll give you a discount on anything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's no problem.
This means you won't go out and stroll with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan hasn't come to take anything; I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
Please, woman, may God bless your parents, ask him. I'll call you later just to make sure again.
And you're calling yourself.
People offer us discounts.
I told you.
This work is wonderful.
But let this man come and take me!
The minister's happiness annoyed me, may God harm him.
Hello, hello Minister.
No, but I'm a bit tired today and
Alright, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your disposal.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and show you around, and I hope he can find a party or something for you.
And then, a party?
No, no, we don't have any activity today.
No, we don't.
Well, where can we find that?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone we can ask?
Go, may God help you.
Lie down and rest.
One moment, Saad.
Anything, even a henna night?
Yeah, this is good.
There might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and find a photographer to take some pictures of his face.
Alright, alright, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a reserve league match. Leave him alone on the field!
What's this! This minister taught us!
Great, that means he reached the top.
His end is very near when he becomes the talk of the town.
My lord, he has become much more popular than you.
Sir, if you go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh! My lord judge,
Shining star.
We'll stop it and bring it back to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear to God, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll beat you up. I'm not going out.
Brock smashed their cameras. I don't want any photos.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I've missed the train.
This is my brother, Khulood.
There is no might or power except by Allah.
Why this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see it!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this my cat?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, my love.
What do we do? He's so attached to her.
"There is no power or strength except from Allah, you keep coming back to the same topic."
Get out, get out and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest, don't make a big deal out of this.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my father, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
This means that he was playing, playing.
Yeah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
As for Saud, I know how to deal with him.
Poor Khulud, I wish all children were like him.
Turn away from these campaigns and the nonsense he invents about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Hi, Hamada!
Listen to what I say.
There is no might or power except by Allah.
I'll let my dear Amal choose for herself.
But, what do you really think?
I say that the one overlooking the sea is the best.
So that in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can go directly from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please, you must set the wedding date.
No problem, it's just a year and a few months.
What's with your brother, he puts on too much perfume.
Frankly, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is quite different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know there are unisex perfumes.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
I don't care.
I can't believe it, Khalid!
It's not the perfume that you use like women.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?!
Frankly, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Nowadays, perfumes are unisex.
I'm warning you here.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very popular in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does some moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid's cousin's daughter.
This is for my cousin Khalid's worthless daughter.
Well, you'll see what I'll do to him.
I'm waiting for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and you'll see. Let Saad come! I'll send him the Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, I was defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad? Oh!
And I will travel tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself? (Proverb), Where are you going by yourself? (Proverb)
What will people say?
They will say that their son has left them and traveled, and you don't want to cause us a scandal!
Oh, really?
What your son Khalid did is honor and pride!
A man who turns himself into a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people when they say this is the brother of the gay man.
His saying that he travels for treatment, study, work, or even that he commits suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
So, where are you going?
What matters to me is where I go (proverb).
This is the end.
The other person we don't know where he is, and this person here is packing his bag to travel.
Even we don't know where he will go?
What did you expect it to be?
What's wrong with you? I brought you to comfort me, and you're throwing harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you were busy.
And your father is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Is there no hope for your sister?
You're right about this.
What Khalid did humiliated us in front of people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is the biggest flaw in my father.
We are now in the strange, bad case of Khalid.
I didn't tell him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house shouldn't have deteriorated to this extent, Oula!
Don't be surprised.
Khaled and his friends don't care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever name was given to them by religious values
And they go to dance and play.
In the evil swamp.
Really? Oh! My son, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Father.
Take care of yourself, my son, oh!
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm scared of what will happen, come with me!
All right, Mom.
I can't believe my dad is still listening to the CD, it's only three minutes long.
He can go out.
Where will he go? He doesn't have enough time to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad? Oh!
Daddy!
No problem, oh! Hope,
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone who shares your morals,
But forgive me.
May God bless you.
I see you're heading to the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
It's the age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has a riyal, they can take a thousand! Oh, light of my eyes.
I can certainly handle this matter. God bless America, dear.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
This is one thousand two hundred.
May God enrich you, every time you speak to a driver, you ask him, "What is your salary?"
My salary is too low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and there's no benefit. We agreed with him that his salary is seven hundred and I raised it by a hundred when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, when you complete one year of work, we will increase your salary.
He seems greedy and we'll have difficulties with him.
Stop him, stop him, just shut your mouth, stop talking, stop talking, send him back and get rid of him.
That word is easy for you, easy.
So you'll let him chatter, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
You've told me the story now, I'm the man of the house. Shh, stop, you too be quiet, I'll handle this.
Come on, I want you out, come on!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
The manager, this is not my friend, he is my uncle.
He will come for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep it in mind!
Don't tell the lady that I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everything in the world has become expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Manager, I have a lot of problems at home.
These drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred and one thousand two hundred.
And perhaps their number is a thousand and three hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll promote you 100%, and if you don't shut up, I won't promote you at all.
Don't say I didn't raise you better than this, go get a job!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
No use with water.
There's no use in the dead.
I'm afraid so, Shashi.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you earn more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at these, they are all drivers.
How much is the price?
Two thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee that to you.
I was wearing my cloak and was about to go out.
I was calling, but no one answered.
He opened his room and the closet was empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I won't say anything except "May God protect us from its evil."
Alright, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you bear no responsibility.
We'll do our best.
And also look around in the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he is satisfied, he will surrender himself.
We bring them in, spend money on them, give them clothes and food, and train them to drive cars.
This is not within his purview.
The match is about to start, come in, you'd better come in.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily caught.
Do you know that if we don't score more than three goals, it means we haven't won? We need ten or fifteen goals.
This is blatant mockery, blatant mockery. Let's make it clear that this is blatant mockery.
This is their level. If they don't score more than three goals, it's not the Foxes.
Take it from me.
By ourselves, by the players, by the performance.
They don't have anything. If they get less than three, they should thank God, they should thank God.
Any goal, this is just a warm-up. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, you're now relaxed and happy.
Do you think there are some other goals as well, or is it just the end of the road?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll feel dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, no, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said that this fox causes a lot of problems.
You can't hold it.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know him or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the "Refresh" show.
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I will defeat you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Fox, what do you think of today's result?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, the foxes are the winners.
The birds came to get their food and then flew away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
I didn't see what your honor did on the field.
The crowd couldn't stop laughing at him.
This is clear on the field, and thank you for listening.
The true fan who has genuine loyalty to the club.
He hung out with the Qatari elite who went to shopping malls and places like that.
He invited me for a cappuccino.
What a strange world, human!
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't you feel ashamed that my team defeated yours by four goals?
Speak obscenely, talk obscenely about the club and the team, and you'll see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The reason for that is the referee.
He expelled a player from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmaq.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
We met every month to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board member of the club is the one who will make the decision.
They are not children, and each one of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. A fox.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One speaks very well, the other is mute.
In your opinion, is it a pen or a watch?
I know now how I can reach him.
The crowd has left.
Wrapped around him.
He turned from here.
He was driving the car fast.
We've lost him now.
Great!
Shut up, you don't make decisions. I'm the master of the house and I'm the one who decides.
We must be certain.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subug tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, thank God.
How can I assist you, people, what do you want?
* * May God bless you,
Please, everyone, would you like to have some coffee?
You don't have anything to say, may God bless you. You don't need anything, may God exalt you.
You're saying this and I'm sure, is that right? We're about to embarrass ourselves in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Mama, mama, I'm mama.
Now, what will your father do with us? I don't know.
I didn't mean it, oh my mother!
Please, Mom, don't tell Dad.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
He will surely kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What are we going to glue, boy?
How can we find something like it? I don't know where your uncle bought this, it was a gift.
I'm afraid of him for you.
Mom, I'm afraid he's going to hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Go to your room quickly.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind?
Are you blind to break the vase, are you blind?
Mom, didn't Walid come to see you?
No, oh! My daughter, he didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, for he was afraid of his father.
This is not true. Have mercy on this boy!
This is not upbringing, may God guide you, my daughter!
What should we do now, Mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I let him worry about the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is kind, friendly, and beloved, my daughter!
No, no, my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from Satan and do not worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
Well, goodbye, my daughter.
Where is Walid?
My father is going to hit me.
Grandma, my father is going to kill me with his beating.
Don't be alarmed, my dear!
Don't be nervous, my love!
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face has turned yellow.
God guide him, God guide him. Come with me, my son, just for a little while.
Oh God, the Generous One.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come, my son, don't worry!
No one interferes in raising my son.
This is my son, and I raise him the way I want.
But the poor buyer was anxious, trembling, and panicked about something he had not intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally knocked over the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to do it.
You! You must support him!
Please don't tell him anything about me. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where is he now? Where is he? Why is he here at this time?
He is not here.
He's here! Where?
Come inside, quick!
No, no, I'll give it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than this old thing?
Come on, Nasser! Oh! Brother, we want to play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Dad, just this game and then we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Come on, Dad, go ahead and ruin the game.
Come on, Dad, don't take it seriously. Come on, come on, Dad, we'll study.
"What? What are you talking about! Listen to me,"
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Waleed now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't care.
I'll tell him you don't listen to me.
Go. Let everyone take their books and start studying.
Alright, dad, put your phone in your pocket. We're going to study, dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really very confused. I don't know what to do?
I'm afraid that if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
He will surely ask me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
So, what's the problem if you tell him?
If he knows that Waleed is wetting his bed, he will kill him.
Oh! Mother, he is the one we should blame. It's all his fault.
Oh! My daughter, it's psychological.
The boy is not a child, but rather he is now twelve years old.
It's okay, my daughter!
She will come to have lunch with us and I will give him some hints.
And I will consult his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just an excuse, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he pees in his bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He said I must take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
He is right.
They must take him to the hospital, oh! My son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He is looking for a good dry hose.
He beat him until the last person in the neighborhood heard his screams.
Sit down!
Come on! My daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and take a bath, I'll get you some clothes. Go!
Please, I beg you.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you call this a pass?
Khulood got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass card?
But their grades are good.
He told them that they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
These are my children.
Alright, I swear to you, uncle, this will be the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go with us to public places.
We went to the hospital yesterday and they told him not to enter. You're not allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, uncle, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, uncle.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, and what you'll see at the end of the year if none of you get fifty.
I will drain the pool.
I'll fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
Good! Oh! Khalid, well done.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent! Oh, Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and you were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
You, boy! I'm talking to you!
Call, call your classmate.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandmother's house.
No, he didn't go there.
So, where is he? Where is he?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
What's wrong, brother? Oh!
Ah, of course he failed and he's afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, he was an excellent student and ranked second in his class.
But he was too afraid to go back home.
Because he only lost two marks in the math subject.
May God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh! Waleed, come here.
Forty-eight, forty-nine. You've lost a mark or two. That's okay. I won't say anything, won't scold or beat you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
Saudi Arabia tops the list with 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States of America, and Nigeria.
3% for each of them and then the rest of the world combined at 15%
Therefore
In addition to production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and underlying reasons behind the rush of the major industrial nations to occupy this region and its countries.
At the top of which is the United States of America, which is the largest consumer of oil in the world.
But oil prices are on the rise.
At the same time that the value of the US dollar decreased
That is taken as the unit for pricing oil.
Where the price per barrel reached yesterday
This led to increased revenue in producing countries, while
To increase inflation therein
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
Prices of commodities and the cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And viewers who wish to participate can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable MP, welcome.
I'd like to start our discussion about the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where prices might head
Of course, the intriguing question is how far prices might go.
Or what we call the power of the market.
Isn't it OPEC?
And what about the producing countries?
And the producing countries are not responsible for that, nor does OPEC have anything to do with setting oil prices.
Is the only relationship of price the relationship between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand have little to do with this matter.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodities marketing."
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And also gold.
We have seen gold rise from $350 in recent years to $970 now.
And to this day, as I mentioned before, one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, the decline will be slight.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
This is the second quarter expected to see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, the price rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
You mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in it.
Regarding Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation came in light of political complexities?
What accompanied it, and today led most of the activities of American newspapers and world press. This could affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today?
We are in the era of globalization today, and the impact comes swiftly.
Non-real factors may affect.
And created a kind of disruption in the market.
Also spread some types of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but he didn't rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
Markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, there is nothing confirmed now that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
It might be there, perhaps we haven't seen it, what will happen in the future?
But it's us who work in the energy sector.
We see that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
On the contrary, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil going into storage.
There is absolutely no shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps in preparation for the upcoming war.
In light of this reassuring picture you're mentioning regarding supply and the absence of any supply obstacles
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will soar to record-high levels.
Oil prices may reach
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the most important region.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
And today, they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, that is what we are sure of.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
And thus it refers to
This means that in the event of any war with Iran, there will be no guarantee of the extent to which oil prices will rise.
God knows he might arrive today, we managed without him.
War prices have risen to $107 and $110, and they may jump to $110, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is under political and psychological pressures.
And speculators took advantage of these tensions.
Invest only in oil.
Or what is called has not been invested in a real investment, of course, neither future purchases nor future marketing.
This is called oiled paper.
And all of it is speculation on the oil paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
This could lead these people to make more purchases and then more upgrades.
I wish April were April Fools' Month.
I hope there isn't one.
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region and that this issue is at the top of his agenda.
Cheney is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese bag.
And I can't predict what's going to be in it, you know.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens. If we're talking about April, it will be here in a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world may pay the price.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf region will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
The cost of producing it is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
Look, we've been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Usage
To the end, and do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said: "It's strange that you talk among us in closed rooms."
Not the same way you talk in front.
He said about the media or about it: It is purely political motives.
And of course, there is what is called double standards or double speak.
The language you know is Arabic, and the countries of the Gulf are known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.
It has significance in the present time, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And entering into them
Despite all this
Leader of the Central Region
Wage war on Iran.
Even if there is an aerial war or air raid as they say.
In the supplies
You are not late, in fact, you are very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We don't deal with Westerners either.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Non-renewable energy, I mean.
For (i.e.) generosity
Arab generosity
Please give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are the citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and the countries.
You are very generous to Americans, insisting on keeping their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the real price for the decline of the U.S. dollar ranges between sixty and seventy.
Okay, the price is now one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar fell by thirty percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline seen in the US dollar
If we take
This comparison
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to depreciate.
A weak or stagnant U.S. economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So, what happened to this weakness and this economic stagnation?
And you too become
The United States downplays the benefits of the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil prices are linked to the dollar.
The first who, more than 100 years
The first to export the first barrel of oil was the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And it has been so since the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
That became history.
For a hundred years past, the world has been reacting to this matter and fixing its prices.
Which puts Norway today as the third-largest oil-producing country.
and oil exporter
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing is in dollars, not in local currency.
Everything is changing in the world, and there are other sources and information pointing to something different from this.
You are the Gulf countries.
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
This situation continues as long as oil remains a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to protect these regimes.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's seize OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent, esteemed deputy.
Among thirteen countries
Out of eighty-five barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are many giant countries in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles to pricing in another currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
Isn't this when adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states, the heroes.
Today OPEC's share looks like everyone's share.
There are sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted to.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention towards change.
What kind of attempts?
But these countries cannot change the pricing currency now.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me now speak about why they are Europeans.
They do not export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because their currency is expensive and valuable, which is in their interest.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they incurred losses.
With one euro, they issue one and a half barrels.
No, you are the loser because your currency has dropped because it's tied to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a huge loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical relationship.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And now you're attached when you talk about detachment.
This is like marriage when we get married.
And if you want a divorce, it's not an easy matter.
No, here.
Or that you've entered into a Catholic marriage with the dollar.
The costs must be studied in some way.
It was inspected professionally and examined.
Kuwait also dismantled twenty-five percent of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar
You may adjust your currency's rate.
Today is about the topic, but that means you don't intend to study the topic or think about it.
Of course, the test differs, as stated by the Honorable Prime Minister.
He said the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be part of this study.
There's no direction you can go in on this issue by yourselves.
Kuwait also went its own way, so why don't you follow its steps?
Economists say this is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
for these four Gulf states to announce
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support her personally.
Will support her.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
He made what he made from one country or two.
Until the time of the currency
Therefore, you won't be able to save the situation now.
Of course, there will be experts conducting this study.
And they are those who
They are not experts, this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush, see what's happening today.
People started, I mean...
Of course, in a position of complicity
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar has now reached fourteen percent in 2007 and will reach 15% next year.
Ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Salaries of residents in Qatar have eroded by between thirty-five and forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the extent of the salary increases.
We are in Qatar for at least the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to the "Without Borders" program. In this episode, we are joined by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
Minister of Industry Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah speaks about the dramatic increase in prices.
in oil that brought tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
I am writing about oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The UAE's reserves amount to seventy-eight and a half billion, and it produces sixty-two percent.
Tons only, and the report published in the "Kuwait Times" is an economic report, and Gulf revenues are one of the largest revenues.
The expected revenues for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2008 were equal to one hundred and nine billion.
And that was it.
One hundred and seventy last year, sixty-six in the UAE this year, and the number was expected to be seventy-five.
Kuwait is forty-six, and it was fifty-four.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's a gas, as other reports have said, and I swear to God that we don't envy anyone, I mean we don't envy the MP's happiness.
Iraq is forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it reached one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries issued one thousand billion, meaning one trillion.
A dollar, and that was a variety of imports.
U.S. investments reached three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
The percentage in Bahrain was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5 but it will increase to 7, and in Qatar, it was 13.75 but it will increase to 15 percent in Qatar.
This means that those living in Qatar can expect higher living costs and higher prices for goods.
Life is consumed, prices rise, and reach high and even higher rates in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be.
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll be increasing their salaries by 50%.
No, they will say you are against raising salaries.
This is not true.
In the cabinet, against raising salaries.
That there is a problem and that the solution must be the optimal solution.
And it's not a quick fix.
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And there will be, there, there... that's all.
The most important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness has issued a decision to form
And he places
It lays a strong foundation.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
Specialized in market research, which was published last February, just days before that.
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you will solve the inflation problem and let inflation devour these people's income.
Many of them now
Earnings realized in other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve the inflation problem, and lower them again.
I repeat what they say, which is to balance the subject.
But now
And not through a temporary solution.
Increase it further.
Therefore, here.
To put an end to inflation.
Boredom will always be present.
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, wasn't it?
The second point is
And those who work in the private sector are not like those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
Therefore, this question of increase must now also be considered fairly.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, sir, not in Germany.
I'm telling you the opposite, today the private sector started paying.
That most
Qatari nationals who were used to working in government offices moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
You're facing a problem.
To move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
It offers good salaries.
Linked to what is called market power.
Or market power
They don't have very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar has low salaries or low expenses.
Or with the expenses that come with them.
Agreed, based on our clear understanding.
I don't predict events, nor do I say there will be a raise in salaries.
There is no hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give her some time.
Controlling inflation
And God willing, this is what was said in the report, which is that Qatar in the year two thousand and eight
God willing, we say that.
We see that these numbers will change.
Spray some on people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, professionally and all.
Inflation
Because spending
A lot of things related to different projects.
Let me take some questions from the audience and I hope everyone asks a straightforward question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
This is based on the ruling families of the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is the existing disagreement in OPEC.
Secondly, the total oil revenue goes directly to the governorates.
Then to the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, conditions will remain the same.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
I won't belabor the point. The brother mentioned the regimes' systems and the issue of the Qatari riyal's peg to the dollar or other Gulf currencies' peg to the dollar, but
America wants to globalize the world and make it submit to her.
The U.S. deficit, with trade between China and America reaching eighty-two billion dollars.
In addition, the European Union provided sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states.
It will end in a confrontation between America.
Among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, this issue may become a problem.
Purely military
The explosion had Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and American bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question is: Mohammed.
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, what's your question?
But from what I saw, His Excellency insists on not responding.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is in a state of decline.
With God's permission, he will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
He should follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed, thank you. Now we have the final contribution from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is:
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for the great interview.
What's required? With God's permission, a salary increase will improve things.
It's true that we all face problems, but not in salaries, no.
Salaries, God willing, are things.
Okay, tell me your question quickly.
Your line will be cut. Do you have any questions?
All that is due to the rise in prices, as the increase included all goods, and they are all imported.
I am from European countries.
We have factories and laboratories in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you, you took your time.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important one.
In the case of supporting the poor, the man told you: Stay with the poor, Your Excellency.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
We are here for some brothers.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and what are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
This wealth, where does it go and what do you do with it?
What falls under the response framework?
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in an unreal way that has nothing to do with reality.
The person who does not see with his own eye.
If he comes and sees Qatar and the tremendous developments taking place there.
You are right, you are asking, growing significantly large.
And every individual has the right.
And you are few in number, so where will you bring people from?
Does this really mean you'll be bringing in surplus from China, for example?
No, we will not export, God willing.
The country is based on a plan and
Complete independence from money that comes from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
that Qatar will become
This is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
And today as well.
The focus is on
Which will have a great impact.
Post-Oil and Gas
So you're not copying Dubai.
Every country has its own unique characteristics.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
About the voters
There will be a medical city where people come to get treatment.
There will be a media city that will adapt.
Of course, in today's world, we should build.
Building a vision
Transitioning beyond oil and gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we were not prepared for this change as it took us by surprise.
And we were unprepared for it, neither from a human perspective nor technically nor even educationally.
The situation has changed after thirty years.
Even better
There is a vision today.
And the vision
And the vision
Thank you, Mr. Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
To continue with us in the hope that we have provided you with
Qatar's foreign policy appears unclear to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
Meanwhile, Qatar was maintaining relations with Israel and still is.
From the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
Qatar presented.
It has started.
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was also not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli prisoner.
Gilaad Shalit was assisted by the hand of Qatari foreign policy in a way that angered the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power is it that puts you in such a position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us via our website at www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Excellency the Minister
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine of Al-Hijaz.
The agreement that was concluded with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during which contacts were resumed and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was too long and needed a lot of answers without your final question.
What I believe you gave him
Especially regarding the Saudi matter.
What is flour?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is very important to the State of Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of Al Jazeera.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
Points of view
Praise be to God, it was thanks to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
Noticeably in the Gulf
Over a hundred years ago
It was a bright, honest, and trustworthy relationship.
I want to put an end to the misunderstanding between the two parties.
This issue has been addressed and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It's not a seasonal relationship, but a strategic one.
We hope that this situation won't persist, but rather evolve.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or else I could have prevented many problems.
I always say what I believe.
Therefore, Saudi Arabia is not considered diplomatic, but rather a belief.
The topic of the island falls under media.
Between the parties, many countries have become entangled in the middle.
Thinking that this might take points to gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Reconciliation within the Gulf house
I mean the opposite of what used to be the case.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, there was only an agreement of love and interest.
But apart from that, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It originally relied on a closely related strategy.
Can we say that in one, two, three, and four?
And there must be unity.
Some disputes were settled accordingly.
Between some Arab countries and the attempt to settle other disputes
Because if we look at the differences in the Arab world now, we find that they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain issue, and another country has a different opinion.
This represents two different opinions.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Criticize him.
Were you exhausted and decided to move in another direction? From there, you moved to a bigger country, Egypt.
Alright, it's the same idea.
No, no, we don't enjoy either this or that, and we have nothing to do.
Dealing with any party in this manner
I mean that the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
They and I know that there is a great understanding between them.
And you know that we have established
And there will be some kind of models.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
I started an argument with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram in its 18th issue published last April.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
The investigation, which was comprehensive, stated that extensive inquiries had been made.
A sabotage plot in the Hezbollah network was uncovered.
Targeting Egypt, and involving three countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And its struggle over the years
I'm not saying this to influence anyone's feelings.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And who was cautious.
On Arab relations.
The first point
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we acknowledge.
Qatar is
A smaller-sized state
which can be part of such schemes
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries at one time, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
And thus, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I'm trying to say is that a house can be protected by God, and Syria and Iran can defend themselves. I'm not going to defend them.
If stability is achieved in Egypt.
Why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids do not bring things out of nothing.
He said that the small State of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you were seeking to organize a parallel conference to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera channel.
Yes, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
We are uncomfortable with that.
But I can say that we are certain.
That concerns us.
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
They forced our brothers in Egypt to do that, and that's why we blame the Egyptian officials.
The ongoing dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'll get to it.
Days of the sweet scent of peace and the cause of peace, and we
And it had been previously held in Egypt.
And then with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You don't disagree with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, since that day.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive to it.
This sensitivity
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this sensitivity
Or three
Gaza Conference that was held
That Egypt does not want it to be held in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar and that there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For over two weeks
But we hold it before any scheduled conference, and it was the Kuwait conference that we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
Also because of procrastination
The conflict began.
A small country cannot do that.
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said that it would happen after
Okay, you're on Al Jazeera.
The Israelis had reported a day earlier that there would be a meeting to cease hostilities before any speech, any person, or anything.
What is it?
My brother allowed medicine and food to enter during the beating that our brothers were forced to endure.
As soon as they said the gate was securely closed.
I can't let the trucks in.
As soon as they tell us there's a deal on the other side and they have to go.
Now is not the time we want to come up with an invention or enthusiasm.
I don't care about either Fatah or Hamas; we care about the millions and half-millions and six-hundred thousand who are being beaten.
And those who do not have medicines.
When we started talking about this subject and the Gaza conference
Qatar's intervention in this matter affects the Egyptian regime.
This is not an intervention.
We didn't say how Egypt would resolve the situation because that's its own affair.
One official said we have uncovered a major plot that emerged from this matter.
We haven't said what the story was yet.
I mean, we are the official person.
He tells us that Egypt is very important.
Well, we realize that Egypt is a large Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask so much of the big country.
Because Egypt is for us
And I had been invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
We weren't invited to attend the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified position.
People in Gaza are suffering.
This is prohibited, I know Turkey has introduced things through Israel.
I would be happy to see that happen through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and in the interest of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he has done a good job, that is important to us.
Let me finish your question, and your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me, but
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now about anger.
The responsibility of the officials in the Egyptian system towards you.
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah enjoyed a wisdom he desired.
And he wanted to make reconciliations.
That's why he intervened and did not allow some countries to attend.
And I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among high-ranking officials
A large country finds it hard to believe that a small country is doing such things.
So, that was for you.
To play any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries decided.
Any other country besides Qatar would be fine.
But this sensitivity will only make matters worse. Why do you have to interfere in everything around you?
We want to resolve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why this sensitivity?
That some brothers from the government
They want it, they have an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza, to a revolution.
This, as the English say, is the Italians' fault.
Whenever something happens
Not only for instructions but also for analyses.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
It has not been solved.
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first look into the reasons that concern my country.
Then see if I have enough time.
And to search for the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar tried to reconcile them.
And thinking about any Arab issue in which he can contribute as much as he can.
Why is it provocative? Why don't we take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
That sprang from his heart
Let me finish.
When an initiative for reconciliation was announced and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we were hoping for something good, and I welcome that.
There are dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, I believe, or a television interview or something like that, I won't respond to that.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and the Arab interests among us.
It is also a response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and advise anyone else is
They try to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics, thus no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations and undermine its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union.
While we are primarily few in number
If we can play this role
This is not correct.
There are some accusations directed at you personally.
Paying Shalit's prisoners to have Qatar take Shalit and surpass the Egyptian role in this issue.
They always accuse us of paying money, first of all, we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about giving money.
But in this case
We support Egypt in resolving this issue, just as we have supported and continue to support Egypt in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
It is he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and we were the first to support the State of Qatar.
The authority and Palestinian institutions should remain until the conflict is resolved.
And we said that
At the Arab League, but he said no, we achieved it because we believe that some people don't want that.
But we did that cleverly.
Is he talking to his boss?
His Prime Minister
By God, I don't know if there's a problem.
I don't know which one of them it is.
They decided now in the twelfth issue released last April exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to confront and put an end to the media outlet known as Al Jazeera.
It's a matter of days and everything will be over.
Are you afraid the island will become a thing of the past?
Do you mean that we are now living in a stage of political adolescence?
You, too, hesitated to go to Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We didn't give in to them, and they didn't give in either.
We treated them as brothers.
A compromise offered by a small state to the large state of Egypt.
No, in Saudi Arabia there is an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk.
Okay, what about the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him heavily.
Let me be frank with you.
Or is it a disagreement on the main policy?
I hope this is not a personal issue because we have no personal issues. I've told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If you asked me, I would say there are two problems: Gaza and what else?
And this issue has greatly affected us all.
We want to solve this problem from a psychological perspective, i.e., solve this dilemma.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it's clear that things got worse and weren't resolved.
No, no, there was listening.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They blame us, and they are right to do so, for they are our brothers.
And we blame them for that, for it is their right as our younger brothers.
For a large country, we do not want to compare ourselves to any other large country.
I mean, Egypt is big enough to please everyone.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution must come from heaven.
For us, if there is anyone waiting for satisfaction
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with non-peers or non-siblings.
Yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great country; it is a magnificent state.
But if there is someone deceiving another person
I know Israel is doing this to us.
The previous American policy under the previous administration was also either with me or against me.
Therefore, I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America on this issue.
Also, if we consider their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that there are some imperatives even for a large country.
What controls your policies?
We have no movement, the only thing that moves us is one thing.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal affairs.
And we will help the Arab world whenever we can.
Sources of power: Al Jazeera and Al Udeid Air Base.
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say what they want, either Qatar the great or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First, we expelled the Israeli office and closed it down.
First they said close the office, so we did, then they got angry and went to complain to the Americans, can you believe these people?
Join the team called the Devil's Team.
What they say.
Americans, Europeans, and my friends, we know how to deal with them.
Conspiracies
that were conducted
This is a flaw, we've reached a certain point, and then what?
Fry it now.
In bullet points, how will you resolve the issue with Egypt?
Based on the fact that Egypt plays a major role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to look at him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious about this matter.
But some of the crew
I need to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion or government leadership or otherwise or foolish leadership
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how this is going to happen.
And I know there's time to think
And there will be a time either from us
If it was up to me
Or from those who have it.
Great Arab interests brought them together.
We will discover this matter one day.
You mean that life still goes on for a long time.
Which means we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you're using.
If someone helps us with a hand, we'll repay them with a whole arm.
Now His Highness Sheikh
We never got used to running.
Only on a sound basis are we prepared to work for Egypt.
Standing by Egypt
There are many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they were affected by this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or in key positions.
You know that in this matter, it's not our custom to cancel jobs or appointments.
Because these people have nothing to do with this matter.
This is a market that is seeing a change in demand; they are canceling one thing and bringing in another.
It's a matter of supply and demand; some nationalities have increased while others have decreased.
Okay, quick answer.
The office was there.
We've disturbed the office, so it's best we leave now.
We were going to sabotage it on the days they had a campaign, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
That's why we shut it down and let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them, it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
That's why the invitation wasn't an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when the relations, as they say, were good. Now, it's a bit difficult to honor her.
There is no reason now for you to reopen the office during this period.
The office will be reopened when there are no other reasons.
I have achieved great success.
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this matter.
Let me be clear with you, our relations with America are strategic.
In some matters, this is it.
What is the most important thing?
There are issues in our region regarding the resolution of some matters over which we had disagreements with the previous administration.
We now have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration will be able to
Serious about moving the peace process forward and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran and what is the likely impact of that on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among them
Using their usual methods, I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability is similar to what the Emir of Qatar mentioned.
This is important for our region, the Gulf, where we share borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervene whenever any party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
Lebanese groups
How to see
As for Yemen, you have no role there or they have taken a stance.
Listen, it's well-known that we supported unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and the only Gulf country that stood with the unity of Yemen.
In the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet with the Yemeni President.
I explained to him that our goal is to stabilize Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
They didn't respect this agreement, and I don't want to mention what each party did.
But what really affected me was
Was it Qatar that took this position and then was accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And he who stands with unity does not stand against it.
And another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
We don't mind, but to be honest, I'm shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time is up but tell me briefly, will these problems that you encountered due to your efforts to solve problems change your policies in intervening in other Arab problems?
I wish he would listen to me, I see no need for that.
There was a big show once upon a time.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars, better than a headache.
But I say this with confidence, because the time may now have come in the Arab world.
Not allowed under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
It might even be exceptional under Sheikh Hamad's rule.
What happened to the agreement made in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Mandate the committee and provide it with all the support.
To discuss the situation in Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
After we went to New York, we were able to make a fairly balanced decision.
We sought to achieve that in Doha where both parties were concerned.
We tried as much as possible not to hear him, or there wouldn't be.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality on the ground, and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe this is a shared success.
But there was a determination.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly reflects on it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
This site was supposed to be in Lebanon.
With these conditions
And unfortunately
External reflections
I can say that the problem among Lebanese, even if it exists, won't be the first problem.
Alright Sheikh, I know that the time might not be right now, and it might be too early to talk about scenes, but
What happened? Why did you come here?
The conversation about participation in reality has somewhat stopped now.
You weren't even a second late.
I know exactly what was happening, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what had happened.
No, from the beginning.
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him if we went to Lebanon.
I will present the idea that His Highness approved and supported.
Where all Lebanese leaders will be present.
Because here in Beirut you'll have to go to each person's area.
While they are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
That's why we created this atmosphere, but our idea from the start was
And this was the most important decision made by both parties.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I believe this has now been proven to everyone that Qatar has made a great effort.
On both sides.
To reach a dignified solution for both parties.
And that there is a solution and no one will lose.
Before you make any move
Consultations were held at the Arab League and we found great support.
What we did
And I told him this when we were there.
That if we succeed in Lebanon, we will take them to Doha.
And he advised me to do that.
To imprison them and confiscate their mobile phones
They managed to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why did they want a solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia and tension in Sudan.
There are many events happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire
That would be in the best interest of the Arab world rather than foreign intervention.
We are doing our best.
Deploy troops.
Even if it is military.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point that needs to be discussed.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
We need self-examination in the Arab world.
Because of Arab disputes
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
The War of 1973
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem
I believe this is in the interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties should
Gain wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our backyard.
We have neither the power nor the ability.
And how can we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
As Arabs, at least the minimum agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
While we watch
Our disagreement as Arabs and the absence of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
And the Arab states
It's not so much betrayal as it is a kind of...
Jealousy is just a word.
This is a case that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think so.
Alright, will you fulfill this wish and actually call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when you suffer, and rejoice when you rejoice.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
So, is it possible for us to play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if that means...
Enthusiastic about finding solutions, and I'm sure of their wisdom.
They may reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure of it, and with God's will, this will happen.
That relations have become better.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't be sure that this is what's happening now.
I am sure that if Arabs focus on resolving disputes among Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned earlier,
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the presence of a general Arab awakening.
But I cannot say that what happened in Lebanon
This can be interpreted on the ground as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation, and perhaps other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can't just deliver food and medicine.
Providing electricity to people
We in Qatar are ready, and we always call him.
More than one and a half million Palestinians live under siege.
And we don't want them to have weapons or support.
They do all this.
There is no electricity.
And we hand it over to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
As for the Palestinians, we are only delivering them food and medicine.
And our dispute with them can continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
Leave illusions behind you.
The current Palestinian dispute is a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit it.
This is a serious matter, and they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they must seek permission even to go back to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
Finding a solution to this dispute
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and we have stated it to all concerned parties, which is that we...
We will not be a part of it and we will not accept being a party to any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be within a clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Cooperation with Iran and peaceful coexistence with neighbors
But when you say, Your Excellency, that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
No, never.
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if possible.
Frankly, Your Excellency the Minister, we were facing a big obstacle, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but what happened?
This is what led you to this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul, I know it had been scheduled before.
So you knew there were negotiations.
Continue to search for a solution.
There is no doubt that the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led by
To a positive outcome; we've gathered some parties from some sides.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the subjects one by one.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And get rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
You don't consider your role now.
Listen, the most important thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
We have no territorial ambitions.
Or even to control another state or something because this is our state.
Our size... We take pride in ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving issues with our fellow peers.
But this is very important in the Arab world.
There are countries.
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Allowing and supporting some small countries to play this role
In some things he is excellent, in others he is good, and in some things he is less than good.
The last question, Your Excellency the Minister.
What is the main priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or repairing enmity
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
We fix what are our problems in Arab countries.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
At the national and regional levels
But if we become stubborn
Or they will have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the ongoing war on Gaza
We start by requesting a meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
As if you'd changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
What our brothers in Gaza are facing
Circumstances that require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before that.
Not only through a Security Council resolution, but also by
They are not to be trodden on or despised.
Let me express this in a different way.
And we are being punished.
That the street can no longer bear it, if we as officials of the Arab street bear it.
That will not be tolerated.
When we were in Egypt
There was written consent between ten and eleven o'clock.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
We cling to it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if they have a point of view in a certain meeting.
And how can this problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not advertising, but our goal is to find.
So you didn't ignore the summit.
We even ask ourselves
We'll go press the other poor side.
Former and latter and the Security Council resolution, but let's just stick to the topic of the Arab summit and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever attends it.
We found that the majority of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whoever comes.
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
The Arab nation only, if we went to any nation in Asia or in Latin America.
Unsolved
Classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our view?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No country allows the intervention of good or evil.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if we were supposed to be preoccupied with an internal Arab conflict.
Alright, if we go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope Israel finishes its mission, and then
Alright, the second Arab ministerial meeting you were invited to attend.
Controlled by discussions, disagreements, and violent arguments
There is an important point.
This is not what matters.
When we request a meeting to be held
Terminal stations
There is no longer peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there is a party that tells you we must wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace talks with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose on this matter.
There is a greater loss than the one we have suffered now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that arguments are not important.
There was someone who wished for the destruction of Hamas and such.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a disagreement between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to speak for others.
It is important to be men to ourselves and men to our state.
We implement the policies of our countries.
Who are the people who do this kind of work on her behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What is his agenda?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
The dispute here lies in whether Israel will implement the decision immediately.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and claim Chapter 7? I'm sure there will be difficulties.
Not held accountable by the international community, and if that happens
That will be on a regular basis.
The situation
Make sure they did something for the Jew and the Israeli.
To get their rights
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs do not go to the Security Council
They agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try to do that for us.
Because we are in the Arab world and there are many people, and you can see how the Arab street reacts to this matter.
But this decision is important.
Regarding the matter of contacting our superiors one by one.
In the end, they said there was nothing and that it was a lie.
Fine, if we were like Germany or others, would we demand?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who attacked, just say you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
Work hard on how to
His introduction
As if it were destiny and God's will.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Some Arabs considered, or there were those who considered, the decision to be 1860.
Our colleagues worked hard to pass the resolution.
Issued by the Security Council
What I want to say is that it was a victory or it wasn't.
And what will lead to that?
Let's assume that victory...
What are we going to do?
We are supposed to not adhere to the rest of the decision.
But I assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will comply with the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel agreed again.
This means that we
Will you have an alternative, or better yet, will you be the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't believe in the Arab nation.
At the same time, he is prepared for any alternatives.
And I do not believe that the Arab nation is ready for that.
As part of the implementation of the siege on Gaza
For various political reasons
To make one group dominate another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start by trying to make plans.
Once they held a meeting, I don't know if it was Arab-European intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And after they did that, I mean we participated.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be an arrangement for this matter.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The follow-ups because the Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I will speak about the subject two years ago, but in the matter of the decision specifically.
Do you have any reservations about his conditions?
It was neither released nor implemented.
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
It was required that everyone have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same viewpoint, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, I said that there are parties
The victory of one group over another that participated in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there?
Conspire an Arab plot in light of what's happening in Gaza now.
We are partially aware.
On this matter, let me tell you that we are not fully aware of it.
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
He was fed at the Arab and international levels.
And if not refueled, it won't make much difference.
And that was after the elections.
And Hamas came and seized power.
By the majority
We had to give them a chance and see.
They want reform, or they are still revolutionaries who only know the gun and fighting.
But on the day they came.
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some say that an attack has just taken place.
The violation carried out by Hamas that led to the breakdown of the ceasefire, or the violation carried out by Palestinians from Gaza that led to the breakdown of the ceasefire.
Truce
That remains at a time when the Palestinian people in Gaza have been suffering from hunger for two years.
This is good.
For reasons of Israeli security
It's clear that we don't want them in power, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
And so who should make the decision?
Either this or that, not every country has the sovereignty to choose.
Our government
This is the main problem.
But I'm sure the problem could have been solved.
If we had worked hard, we would have worked hard to fuel the conflict.
But it is clear that we were asked to allow one group to dominate over the other because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider him.
Everything that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party that they would grant them a proper life.
They didn't do anything for them.
And we return to the international and Arab efforts that were made to put an end to what is happening, as you said you were.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian Initiative, that initiative.
And Egypt in Cairo
These Egyptian efforts
Not at all, this is not a loophole.
This is required for performing an important role.
Also, Egypt's borders are next to Israel and Palestine.
That we
And we don't want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we bring people together to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
There must be.
That's why we always ask them to play a big role.
What was announced?
Does this mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give the possibility of success or study.
I think his chances of success are slim.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Making Palestinian perspectives more similar.
And the person who should discuss the initiative is the affected party in Gaza.
Because he is the only person who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was issued
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we suffer from.
We don't want to hear any sides.
But I really wanted to, when the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the league, they asked to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't let power control us.
Our goal should be, not to build our policy,
To stay in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its clauses.
Do you think that in principle this could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860 as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day that passes
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter, and when they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are cautious of it.
I would like to clarify everything I said.
And that we must now solve this issue.
And not in the way Israel wants.
The Turkish role has attracted attention since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express that?
Arab vacuum
It's undoubtedly a great opportunity.
It has an Arabic depth.
Accessible Entrance for Disabled Individuals (Arabic)
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to conflicts.
Partly because of perspective, everyone thinks their perspective is the best.
Another person believes that his viewpoint is better.
Without conscience, how can you make people respect and acknowledge that there is an Arab decision?
Or they will come to us one by one.
Someone else will say, "No, it's okay, we'll give them two or three extra days so we can reach out to them and bring the colleagues up to speed and resolve the issue."
We must rise above this level and not accept it.
Hamas may have made mistakes, but we will deal with them.
At the Arab level
But for now
At least we tell them no.
Within the required stance from Qatar, there are positions such as, we will return to this point later but
Also in the field, I heard it at the same time.
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas' Political Bureau
Firstly, everything Brother Khalid Meshaal said was unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit down with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
We go to him at the Arab University and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions Israel also imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions, isn't it allowed for them to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
They are just cattle and we should not listen to these people, they told me once that De Gaulle did not listen.
Completely different, first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
He liberated his country from the fiery occupation, with the help of allies or without.
What we're talking about now is
Is this the Arab gift we are supposed to receive?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
which can be satisfied from these courses that require
Also, many of those criticizing Qatar in this case are demanding
About what's happening with the actor and whether the office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
Cut off the relationship, all relationships, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
That we
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but in this decision and even more difficult ones.
More than this decision.
This means that we must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
Doesn't one of them sell out the other for spiritual, material, or so-called gains?
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Chavez's good subject is a different matter, he has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remember.
Five ambassadors enjoy permanent membership, and present arguments proving that these are films.
What we have finished, the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, Your Highness.
Or they demand that the Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if it were framed within a single Arab framework, it might work?
But we demand an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
Nor do we encourage
How are you going to include Syria, Lebanon, and other countries when there are Arab countries that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
Change in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already over.
In goals
The important issue
And we know the structure of Lebanon.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if she returned her lands.
The situation in Gaza will change; they are still suffering.
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals of Israel, the practical goals of Israel.
One day someone is struck, one day someone is punished, and one day someone is pleased.
An example of this is what happened in Lebanon; they consider it a bad example.
The sample solution that became available in Lebanon.
He considers it good.
For Gaza
Listen, the problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than the one in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other on whether we should reclaim our land today or tomorrow.
Their disputes are about power.
On the distribution of power
This differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than a Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And herein lies the problem
His Highness Sheikh
This means we only have a few minutes if we want to finish the matter where it stands.
"And diplomacy"
How can this process end?
Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you.
Or rejection.
And help
This was not suitable for us.
This will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But from the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we haven't seen a full initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The issue is not so much a matter of initiative as it is our feeling.
The person who will solve the problem, we will help him without mentioning Qatar because some people have issues with mentioning Qatar.
Neither to hold a summit, as there is a summit to be held in March.
If we take an initiative, we will be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And not to put pressure on them.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
We are going through this initiative in which we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and wish that our Arab brothers would help as much as they can in this matter.
And we hope to keep him out of the competition.
Arab competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one point.
And these are our problems, well, we fight among ourselves and don't agree.
I don't want to go through that.
In Kuwait on the nineteenth of next month, I believe so, of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as you have mentioned and explained, Mr. President
Does the entire Arab atmosphere help? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
Of course, we attend any summit held in a brotherly country.
We have no objection to attending any summit.
But she is not afraid to become a political leader.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they were beaten for twenty-five days?
Will be
Won't they say that the Arabs weren't able to meet?
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this summit was scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In the way we are led
And thus
"And enter in peace."
And say, "This is all there is, and it is guaranteed."
For this meeting
Thank you, audience, for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues until the next break.
A few days ago, there was a celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law in this regard.
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has also delivered over seventy-five lectures and workshops, and presentations and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Let's start by agreeing first on the term currently used.
When referring to people with disabilities, should we say "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities" as you mentioned?
First, good evening.
Taken from a human rights perspective or from a culture of human rights as it pertains to persons with disabilities.
Because he treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
This then resulted in his disability due to his attempt to adapt to society.
The medical concept was prevalent at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Special education and training appeared.
This category has become
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
What are the standard rules from which they were derived?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And they hastened the steps towards the emergence of the international agreement, which was legally binding and characterized by rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
Who treats these people as humans, as persons.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perspective of this segment of society?
Yes, and it is measured in some way.
This varies from region to region.
But the remarkable thing about this is
That the Arab world stands out or differs
But legal trends include human rights, which exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons might be due to a lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say, culture exists but there is a lack of resources, and sometimes there is a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws, but
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries and are of working age.
They are suffering from unemployment.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or the presence of mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
Add disabilities, they will be in remote areas and distant regions.
Therefore, there are many orientations of organizations working in this field and trying to upgrade.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating many religious centers, so to speak
And they went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things we thank God for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Set an agenda
Or the agendas of these humanitarian organizations are inclusive of those centers.
In light of the deteriorating conditions of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't call it, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the disability issue.
If we place this in the social, political, and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be any different.
While they are from marginalized groups
In a country as I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot categorically assert that there has been no improvement in the situation.
It has already been implemented in practice, and if I wanted to give an example, I would say...
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities who have health issues are covered by this strategy and there are other programs.
that we also tried to include
On the ground with local organizations
With us now is Kamal Kiro from Syria, welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Solomon, I'm sorry. Please, Solomon.
My warm regards to you and Madam Hafsa.
Firstly, is there a mental barrier within the framework of the United Nations laws?
Intellectual blockage means that the healthy person was the result of what became a stressful factor leading to intellectual blockage.
That caused my son to become disabled as a result of the torture and imprisonment he endured, leaving him with a mental disability. He is still receiving treatment to this day, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact
Because they know it as they know their children.
And convey the message without exposing themselves.
There are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people
Some of them are apostates or do not follow Islam, and wisdom is not taken from them.
Thank you very much, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
And we go back to our guest for comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental impairment.
Yes, it is among the global rankings.
Regarding disabilities, they are of course intellectual and mental disabilities as they are called.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities, meaning visual, auditory, or physical impairments.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
The verb and the reaction that occurs in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other regions
Certainly, addressing the disability took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, I tried to address and work on certain issues.
In other words, the right for all.
Until they provide them with
And various rehabilitation aspects to ensure their ability to attend school, in addition to work organization.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
It had some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, this international committee is found.
And I, too, as the Special Rapporteur
The fact that my work was truth was a positive point for me even if it wasn't directly related.
That supported this position.
I've seen it in many meetings, like the international convention, for instance.
For the rights of people with disabilities
Hindered by these restrictions or these shortcomings
For example, with regard to legal capacity
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
But unfortunately, the United Nations delayed it a bit during the preparation and drafting process.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I will conclude my speech with this.
From the governments of the world, non-governmental organizations, and the member states of the United States.
We processed another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
Knowing to what extent programs for people with disabilities are on their agendas.
If budgets are allocated with the involvement of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And that is not limited to development issues alone.
We are taking more calls. With us now is Meshri Naji from Algeria. Welcome, Naji.
And you too
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly we should blame.
I wanted to ask, I'm originally a disabled person.
Okay, we'll ask her that question, Nagi Mishri from Algeria, thank you very much, Ahmed.
Welcome, Halabouni, from Greece.
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even taking them on seasonal tours, this is what happens in Europe.
Will a mental patient be considered disabled?
Especially those who may harm themselves or others.
Everything we're discussing falls within the realm of unproductive debate, thank you.
Sister Hassa mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand.
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every institution in the world.
It should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
He will address the inability of many disabled people, war victims, and so on.
Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and mentioned his problem, which is that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, that is, through Algeria.
Community needs must be met within the community itself.
Are these the same rights that anyone else should get?
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I truly call upon governments, Arab governments in particular, from this very platform.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
These needs and rights within the framework of existing plans.
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled person or no need for that if the state
They can, and they are already obligated to implement it.
I advise him first to return and seek refuge with the relevant authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it is national in scope and must be within this scope.
The International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been mentioned, but many countries have signed it without complying with it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why are there no laws?
It is an undeniable fact that we live in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and much that is right.
Certainly, there is no literal obligation in many agreements, and certainly in many treaties as well.
Or an ideal commitment by many countries that have acceded to numerous conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know it.
But the question of adopting and regulating a convention
First, we will ensure that there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of the pyramid, namely the decision-makers.
It starts with officials and gradually grows until it reaches society as a whole.
Also the issue of our commitment to prepare reports and submit them to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
For the reports I worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations, they were...
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
Therefore, there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and call for it.
It is also important that persons with disabilities
And we will listen to what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say.
Mr. Naji Sajjerna will speak about that. Welcome to Mr. Naji and also to Mr. Ali.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
With me, Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
Chaired by H.E. Sheikhessa Hessa
United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, formerly
As a deaf person from Qatar
And the committee's chair, Sheikhaha Hessa, indeed has a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is indeed
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
Especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries should implement this international convention.
This would serve people with special needs, which is essential.
To have someone who can activate this agreement in all countries, truly.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute
We stop.
And here we continue our discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your views on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other topics.
The SMS service is available through Al Jazeera Mubasher channel.
Dear viewers, welcome back and to our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability is an international fund to provide support.
Disability and all countries should be obligated to provide funding for it. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Normative Standards Monitoring Mission
When I worked there for six years, there was no meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria
And I always mean to thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of this country is my country, Qatar.
That established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
I mean, as we mentioned earlier, this point is always raised.
Common people's circumstances
So, what is the term for taking care of or attending to people with disabilities?
This means, if there was a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
Under all circumstances and in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, and homeless children and women.
All these matters we may indeed reach a degree called
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equity
And there are voices that always demand, never getting tired or weary.
Why isn't a part of the Islamic and Arab region allocated, sorry?
In favor of these programs and projects
As he has presented, and I truly thank him for this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
From within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Are the funds allocated to assist people with disabilities intended only for developing countries and Arab states, or...
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person before me, the Swede, yes.
And also some countries of the European Union.
And certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not have done so.
Even if he was aware of this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
As for the Arab region, unfortunately, there have been many promises, but unfortunately, only one country has kept them.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have more calls with us, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, welcome Hamad.
Peace be upon you
And upon you too.
Hello, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa.
Approaches ten
We noticed that this girl was suffering from a psychological disability.
What is your role towards a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even when we try to maintain our composure, things can still go wrong.
What is your role regarding Qatari girls' children?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and Crown Bahjat from Kuwait. Welcome!
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in its dark place?
We can identify people with special needs.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
By boosting individual morale
And its spending on this noble cause.
That is, if we are truly believers.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her and to the State of Qatar for all that it has provided for people with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
And peace be upon you too.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question concerns prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
Perhaps the genetic level was a result of families where marriage between relatives occurred.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leading to disability
Thank you very much, Flag Bearer Chérif from Tunisia, and now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where can a girl with a disability, a mental disability, go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are intellectual disabilities such as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
There was previously
Oh no, I mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The flag-bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
Scientific papers and the like
Not only in the programs of organizations working in the field of disability, but even in the framework of campaigns.
Women-specific programs
All these issues led to the emergence of numerous campaigns and programs related to reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
To demonstrate the risks of consanguineous marriage
and genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but they certainly take time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time there will be a response to it, but it is essential that there be a legal commitment from this perspective.
Yes, Crown Bawgat wondered and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help the disabled, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate done by the World Health Organization for the world as a whole.
There are forty million people with disabilities or approximately that number.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers double.
Like a study conducted in South Africa where they observed and proved
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza
That every person killed leaves behind three disabled persons.
And since the Arab region has become an undeniable conflict zone
Even the suggestion presented by Crowan Behjat
One percent will not be enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
In all honesty and sincerity, I don't think this fits.
This requires addressing their problems and needs.
He emphasized that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Studies conducted by governments often do not count disabled people.
That's correct, and this is related to the culture of the society and sometimes the constraints of the society.
When the census is taken by
Relevant agencies
That there is a person with a disability in the house.
There was only one question asked, and that was whether or not there was a disabled person.
The relevant department and the concerned individuals therein
We collaborated on building the model.
We recommended getting more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the figures are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Care and attention should also be advanced, Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with a disability.
And I thank His Highness, the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
He and his wife, Sheikh Moza, for embracing this category.
I am truly proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her important role
Hello, Latifa Al-Messaferi
Because they represent significant disturbances in society, they are without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Messaifei from Qatar is with us now, Naseem.
Abdulkareem from Jordan welcomes Nesim.
Continue, Karim, we're listening to you.
And peace be upon you too.
God bless you, frankly, I have an intervention.
First, I am a sound engineer and I have worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month to raise awareness about speech and hearing problems.
We were holding conferences, lectures, and awareness sessions on hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, as I have lived there for almost three years so far.
Frankly, it provides new and good services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, and resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They receive good support.
Okay, Kareem, do you have a direct question? The only reason is time constraint, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, there are excellent services, and I think they are outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
Which becomes binding once ratified and acceded to.
As an obligation incumbent upon the State or upon these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of the rights of these people, regardless of
And frankly, what
What should be done during that period for people with disabilities and why?
And you're hoping that happens now.
Of course, I hope to know if
I hope that this will be measured based on this research or study and that more high-quality research will be provided in this field.
Also, it became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have roles, it's not just a matter of rights, they get their rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We have now the presenter from the League and Cup Channel, Lana on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the distinguished captain of Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I'd like to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone can feel free to congratulate Lana. Please.
I had a five-hour studio session, and another two-hour session the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, its land, government, and people, as they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, certainly Lana, as you are from the mathematical field and one of the experts in this area, and you are very familiar with these lines and this field.
Because our file is still
He is competitive, which means we deserve the six-vote margin between us and the United States, where Qatar received fourteen votes and the United States received eight votes.
That was because our file was rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, and it had very good support, for example, the stadiums.
Perhaps some people were afraid, and perhaps there were some bullies, like in the United States.
And some countries may be ready, as they do not need to provide venues, and prepare some projects dedicated to this event in particular.
Because they are already ready.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
That will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, in my belief.
But you, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
This is a great achievement indeed, especially for us, you even saw how the non-athletes were very happy.
Inshallah, Ali, tell me about the moment of the victory announcement.
I was coming out of practice and we were listening to the radio station.
I and one of my friends were waiting for the announcement.
While driving the car and listening to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course we had the skylight open.
So my friend removed his body from the car's roof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, so we turned on the lights and started celebrating by ourselves.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day, in my opinion, as all channels focused greatly on this event.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially the sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
There were many media outlets and channels from all around the world.
I became a main teacher, very clear on the map, and Qatar became famous.
Certainly, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
I believe this is a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Okay, Ali, do they mention the required attributes to join the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
That has fundamental principles and well-planned mathematical tactics for football.
So, what are the rules and foundations that a player should excel in?
And I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Hard, continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I believe every stage has a unique advantage.
He has a unique taste and feelings.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
This is wonderful
It keeps you fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Everyone also watches football matches, you will automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Is it limited to media workers on only one side?
Doesn't that limit you to one part?
It's an open field, not just for football.
It's all sport, but sport is great.
Ali, there are also some other important issues we would like to discuss.
Would you wish to go back ten years in your age to reach the year 2022?
Yes, didn't you wish for this?
Of course, one dreams of this now, especially since it's the World Cup, and now any player
Anyone who just watches World Cup matches will be happy, so how much more if he were playing in the World Cup?
I hope they live up to expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after a 12-year absence from the Gulf Cup.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and beautiful memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar TV channel will become like a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our Dorina is brave and we hope he wins many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point concerning Umm Salal Sports Club.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you are well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Of course, we talked yesterday in the studio about many players.
Therefore, I think some of the young people who were watching us think that you...
Required
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I had a good opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
I managed to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
I'm in very good shape with the team.
How can we make sports a social issue?
Regardless of Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Everything is connected, everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all sporting fields.
And expanding it, so that every individual in this society, whether young or adult, recognizes the importance of sport.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, and that's enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a generation that is aware of sports from a young age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
It is essential for the new athletic generation.
All we have to do is be decisive and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the different club match games?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we suffer from in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance, as the Qatar Football Association has not yet found a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to attend these football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending classes.
The media, by the way, play a crucial role in the public's abstention from participation.
They now use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the football federation has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs employ methods to attract spectators, such as Al-Rayyan Club, but Al-Rayyan is a popular club and does not need to attract audiences.
Some clubs organize activities and events, as do some club management departments.
For the public, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as I said, they need not only financial support, but also much more moral support.
Thank you very much for this wonderful interview, God willing.
Therefore, we'd like to hear your final word on Qatar's win to host the World Cup for two thousand and twenty two, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
Captain Ali, what is the last word you would like to say in this interview, God willing?
Congratulations and I wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and player Ali, I wish you success in your sporting progress and in your life. May God bless you.
I love sports even more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs have become popular nowadays, but they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we will discuss this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
And we will get to know them better through the live meeting that will bring us together.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For several years, a new style of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
Coming from the west, especially from America, is rap music.
Before we start talking about rap singing,
There is boldness in using any word without reservation.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding writing words,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we will get to know all these many and important details through two people who entered this field with strength.
They formed a great band.
Yusuf Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yusuf.
Welcome, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discovered that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Defending citizens' rights.
Including humorous, sad, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I think, are like an artist painting a picture and a poet writing a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society for this type of words?
Two thousand ten.
Do you think people like buying rap music CDs?
A variety of ages.
There are families and many people who are listening more than ever before.
There was something like a website.
How many are you in this band so far?
This means that you can all speak, write poetry, and perform rap-style shows.
As you can say, the singer is the rapper.
He is the person who sometimes plays, and writes words.
Ah, okay!
I ask him to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you produced, Salman, from Youssef, from, from anyone in the same band.
What about putting it on a CD and releasing it to the market?
But you know, if the person is alone, I'll make the album and release it to the market, which is difficult from a business and procedural standpoint.
Well, why didn't you think? You're twenty-five years old, and one hand can never clap.
They must be two, but you, God willing, have twenty-five hands, may God protect you, you are all like young men and brothers.
You can create a CD and market this CD through multiple websites.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and local newspapers as well.
I think there are thirteen songs.
Registration is not like it is now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
Its quality is poor, not like now, but it's clear.
He has produced nearly fifty CDs.
In rap, I can't say there's nothing because there might be young people who have known this art for ten years.
Not as strong as recording and distribution at that time, but now it's different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, and now there is a wide range of electronic music genres.
These young people and these artists produce a collection of wonderful songs.
Similarly, we would like to talk about the concerts you participated in.
See, the party we participated in Doha is one party.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club, and they were very cooperative.
We sneaked a peek to see the audience.
We were surprised; we didn't expect such a huge number.
We were also surprised by the larger number of families attending.
More than the youth
The organization was excellent.
We were a bit nervous because this was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect such a large turnout.
The audience reaction was fantastic.
And it took a long time, so there were many songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or words you've composed, that the audience, especially the youth, love.
Let's hear some words, so we can show the audience.
Can we listen to it directly?
Take your time.
Continue, Salem
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
It's great to come to the show in the morning.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They have no idea about this topic.
The words are random.
Well, for the songs you performed, give me some of your previous words.
See, not all songs are random, or as they call it in English, "freestyle."
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Dawaa program.
We are live on television, for the public.
To find out what 1121 will offer
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful song I just heard
I insisted to the youth that they distribute it everywhere and on the internet.
I really appreciate that. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
It won't be easy for him to do that.
Therefore let each one write.
Certainly, I believe that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write out of love for sports.
Love of the homeland or country
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent Qatari youth.
Doha awaits to shine in welcoming the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate this event
We are live-streaming this video.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these live clips together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha Airport this morning to continue the journey.
Preparations to host the massive continental event
Let's return to our guests Youssef and Salman, whose presence we are delighted by.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, frankly, we
They are preparing to have a party, but it's not definite.
But, you're working on a party that will be announced, God willing, Yusuf.
Insha'Allah, but this is not certain, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you good luck, and be assured that our program will support you with all our hearts.
Also, Salman, where do all of you, twenty-five people, meet?
Where do you meet, and how do you bring all the ideas together?
Surely there are shared songs between them.
It's not necessary for anyone like Salman or Youssef or any of you to sing a whole song.
There must be cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to get the twenty-five together in one place.
I started calling Youssef and the other men and asked them to gather in one place.
To look at the song and its lyrics
There's another way.
I register my spot.
And he continued.
So he recorded it and sent it back to me.
And look at other experiments
Collect some CDs of famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Certainly, we always
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in this field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to develop a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone, and the same phrasing,
We're not producing anything new, we want to do something.
Therefore, we benefit from them a little.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
Primarily, let's watch the report together so we can learn and enjoy it, let's watch it together.
These talents that some people possess are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and good ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the expert, one can.
Discover, locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
He sought help from experts to locate the wells.
To dig
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
These are not modern techniques.
Soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And there are underground rivers in it.
Either you are pomegranate seeds.
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of watercourse detection is applied scientifically.
And finally, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back
Therefore, we start from here by marking
And here, the broadcast ends.
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
To determine the sensitivity of the tool's movement.
I have been to many places.
This means that the success rate is ninety-five percent.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
There is no precise scientific explanation for that.
This method
What is truly astonishing is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to Allah, Who taught mankind that which they knew not. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Those who have their own band and more than one CD.
Whether it's online or over the phone
Sometimes, there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They produce a more powerful song with a stronger theme.
When dealing with a problem, etc., there are many issues.
I look up to him as a role model.
This is what God wanted.
At the same time, we want
Played a wide range of songs
As much as possible
Let's stay in touch from time to time.
So we can keep up with the band's latest news.
But let's focus on the band's name.
This rapper
Let's go back to our guests who are at the corniche enjoying the nice atmosphere.
We are live with you through this live broadcast.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you welcome the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues related to youth.
But only two are with us in the studio.
I'm sure they'll represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome back.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to contact the company, but no one answered us.
As a team, you need to improve yourself, for people are
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
The name of the music band.
You will find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together on this great production.
You're curating images and matching them with songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can just download it on YouTube and video sites where one can follow along.
There are some people we've done that with before.
There are a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a sponsoring company and the lack of a website.
You really need a place where you can all meet as a band.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill and attain?
Our sponsor
He's curating an album for us.
I hope this becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
As a hobby, no more than that.
Yes, we've shared some things, some series.
We hope the situation improves.
And to have someone who supports us and stays with us.
Yes, we want to know your wishes too, Salman.
My only wish is to produce a video.
We wish you good luck.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And to bear a message, as I just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the best.
Say hello to the group, and we wish you good luck.
And we'll finish with the song they produced especially for this show.
This is the KDWDJMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KJ Lady Bobo with SKT, one hot body.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Dawaa program.
We are live on television, for the public.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch it.
To find out what 1121 will offer
Together from Doha's morning
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The director is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
They can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a delivery van or a shopping cart
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will appear displaying the components of this product.
This was a great and practical idea as well.
Just a barcode, and a scanner in the cart detects the item.
Make the shopping process easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I suppose it increases health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, any side effects?
Full details
Or ambition, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues.
This topic addresses traffic congestion and other issues such as parking problems, and it was very creative and beautiful.
Child Cultural Center, God willing
Mr. Abdullah, let's discuss the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the submitted projects or
For example, for underground transport, the great idea is
That when a man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And gather at one point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images they are watching now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, this for example is similar to an ATM.
For women, for example, I have a card.
I'm putting it in, and saying that I need a shirt.
This is, for example, some shops, or if you lose items at home, like the key.
This is missing, like the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
His Highness's wife
At an early age, this is crucial in project design.
Three hundred chosen children
As we have invited speakers and orators
Yes, it was she who hosted the closing ceremony.
To offer their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that central idea.
Various and diverse skills for children
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
It's a fully professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing such talents
Participation from all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Girls' Creativity Center, as the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers played a very important role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And train the children on that.
Engaging and encouraging children, with each program relying on institutional partnerships.
According to the importance of projects and institutions
And what does that change?
Our presence here in Katara gives us a strong boost and great support.
And faster.
We are now, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch in the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We are running it, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, for future generations, and for youth
What is your final word of advice for parents and children watching us now who are interested in joining the center?
More than we provide them with now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We must take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we encourage the child to think.
Therefore, it is important to give the child care and attention.
And also from a spiritual perspective, our problem is that most parents
Help him.
And encourage him, so we encourage parents.
Pay more attention to a child's imagination, for the children of today are the roots of the future.
We toured the exhibition and saw their projects along the way.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And dreams become reality, as many of them have been achieved and have become a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish success for our children who were there.
Our hearts are with you.
This is what God wanted.
Of different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
This matter is very pioneering and deserves to be implemented.
To talk more about this national exhibition
And also the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, tell us briefly about the exhibition.
There were certainly a lot of activities, what can you say about that?
The children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
That was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
It will grow until 2030.
We started training children to envision Qatar 2030 across all three of its axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, how to be creative
I suppose they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will develop more and more.
Sir, I have launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt that when we were walking with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for 2030.
A child thinks about what will happen in twenty years.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There should be some activities, events, and competitions.
Someone won the Stars of Science prize.
And there were also the winners of the first prize of the Arab League.
Sure, all the children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a specific schedule.
To display the projects they have done
There is a large attendance, a very unique presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major awards?
What is an innovative or creative forest or reserve?
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and their vision for Qatar's future.
It's an idea for twenty or thirty.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for twenty to thirty?
The main idea is that there is an electronic chip inside the ball.
He gives the referee a colorful warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movements.
Or that the playground is transformed by this electronic chip.
That is installed in the ball.
There are creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some people might wonder.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Which gives them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Giving them confidence on how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, attached to something he loves, all of this is considered an achievement.
He provided us with support, and we thank him for that.
Which is now in the development stage.
The public, the committee, and some officials also supported these projects.
The forest, no, it was the second one, because this girl...
Pipes, channels for the public to attend underground, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
A huge reserve forest
Where visitors can wander and watch animals and reptiles.
Also, sensors are fitted to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way to access it is innovative as well.
One of the reasons for her success is also her broad and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
There is also a person who talked about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
Many tourist ideas
Very interesting.
Perhaps this is what their minds need, at this time, maybe in 2030.
And it will be achieved in the future.
Three projects.
They said that these projects, adopted by the scientific club, are the ones we need to work on.
There is a project, namely, the unnecessary water produced by air conditioners.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The article says, Qatar University celebrates graduation.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and the University of Calgary
There are also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
Who is considered one of the rising young actors in the Qatari drama scene.
And also tassels and colored threads, until when?
The actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is considered one of the self-made actors.
If it's not convincing,
He will not be chosen to be involved in projects within Qatar.
Actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is currently participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Classifications" Part Two.
We are pleased to have him as our guest this morning.
So that we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his experience in general.
Welcome and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning Show. This is the first time I meet you and your first time on Doha Morning.
With people who work hard for the program
And you, Ms. Lisa.
You are welcome with us. Before we start the conversation, let's begin.
Okay, let's watch.
I am a responsible man and an executive manager.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if one of them agrees not to return the bisht.
Of course I have another question to start with, but since we've watched this part of the series, it's a sequel to the first part.
He noted that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Muradh.
There is a lot of information and details about that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch with you this excellent report prepared by our colleague Abdurrahman Marshad.
Let's see it together.
Therefore, it is certainly the testimony of people who know nothing about flattery or nepotism.
As an affirmation of the history of this city or that.
As far as we see its effects and hear about it from its narrators and poets
It is both classical and modern, making it an important addition to the city's record.
Marat City is considered one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
And some thought it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
and the valley which is named after him.
Its founding date is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
What the city of Marrat is most famous for is Mount Komit, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it is located in and near the city.
Stop. These are historical places.
This view is considered one of the tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia.
The Marat Municipality made a huge effort in creating
A garden on this mountain
And places to sit for the residents and for everyone in the kingdom.
It was named after the companion Khalid bin Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
And among its effects is the Wadi Kimit.
It is a place where stream water is collected and stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
Among the attractions there is also the Dawahi Heritage House.
Marat is a city that dates back to pre-Islamic times.
He is famous for his poets who were influenced by him.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain Komet.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed for the Doha Morning Program
Marat City is north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very private.
We opened a page for him and he was registered through having a private record in our system.
The email is guarded.
This report covers the range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guardian receives a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
Logs into his son's online account.
He sees his son's progress.
He can see his grades and how interested he is with the teachers.
So that we can truly appreciate the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
So that we can bring most of the children in the center and send them our best regards.
Who enrolled in this center with a professor there.
So that we can gauge her intelligence and the level she has reached since she joined the center.
This year, of course.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But this effect is of course achieved at the expense of other works, always.
There are people who only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV, and people turn their months of worship into months of TV watching.
Reduce, reduce, reduce the series, reduce, let them do one every two years, is that better?
Certainly.
I wish they love me in Ramadan.
But I would like to express my greetings to you all.
And we hope,
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And to further develop children's abilities and skills.
Unlike the various schools found in this generous country.
We have a model, and we've spoken to our guest who was with us earlier.
We have with us now Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning to you.
How are you, Amnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start with, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Amanya is an example of that.
We will test the technique or method that Ms. Nesma talked about with her as well.
Do you feel there's a difference in his thinking?
Do you think these skills and techniques
Things will change regarding his mental skills, even his educational level will change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child through an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the student's level or the change in the student's level through it.
A test or something like that will now be conducted.
Amnia will count and answer directly immediately.
Of course, Amanya knows nothing about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second half of this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
And of course, after we presented to you the series of classifications of the first part
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky to play several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distributed roles with CEO Ashraf Shohata alongside Mr.
It's an opportunity from Tara for artistic production.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different from the other.
I'll be playing different characters in multiple episodes.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this work, we have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, and Ali Al Gharair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a cast of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among our young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Assam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we were working on two projects per year.
Maybe that's why I asked you to do this before going on air. You've been doing this since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, or fulfill your ambition of acting.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I took up acting as a talent. The person who adopted me at the beginning was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me a son.
If you need anything, call me.
We were present in all his series.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
And now, without Tara, I would like to extend a very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, and a very, very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there are between 12 to 16 new actors coming every year. Why?
They did it.
Of course, I am very grateful to him because he provides many opportunities.
But, let's assume,
Let's talk about the other series, we had an idea about Tsaniev.
We need to know more about the killer feeling.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, and we have with us the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
Until this action is carried out live.
And we can see how we can deal with the person. Let me first greet Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza with a good morning, welcome.
You're welcome, and peace be upon you.
So let's start with you, sir, please.
If God wills.
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
You feel dizzy sometimes.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yes.
In this way, Mr. Abdel Aziz, you will discover something specific from his hand, which is that he suffers from a certain illness.
On his left side. His ears, he has a non-acute inflammation in his middle ear.
There is pain! What does that mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
Since my birth and since I was a child.
Do you feel pain here as well?
It's the sinuses!
Do you suffer from nose pain and headache here?
I have a headache here.
He suffers from a sinus problem.
This gives him a headache between his eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
Her thyroid gland is not functioning properly, she feels sluggish and lethargic all the time, and she feels her body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either too much sleep or laziness, you always feel heavy.
You have chronic tonsillitis.
In it. See the tremor, notice the tremor.
He's stressed and you never walk barefoot, maybe this is the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this massage beneficial for children as well?
The mother's thumb, thank God, is about the size of a child's palm.
Most children are not sleeping, why?
When you pick him up, he doesn't like it, but people think he does. He has gas in his belly, God bless you.
When the mother puts her thumb, by extending the thumb.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it, so every mother learns this move.
You'll start by pressing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This thing is about the child, is about, is about, is about the child, and it's a beautiful thing.
Well, in terms of discoveries, you have specific discoveries tailored particularly for women.
As we said, ninety percent of women are in every home, may God preserve them.
The first thing, the first warning is about ceramic and even flooring.
Walking barefoot on ceramic is acceptable, but walking on a flat surface is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The evidence for this is that when ceramics were used in homes, health problems increased.
Because it's cool and even.
When there was a carpet, there were problems, as they suffered from asthma.
It has increased.
A woman should focus on walking barefoot on her ankles.
This is the foot and the ankle area at the back, the ankle.
From here, this is the foot and now under the ankle.
This is the first discovery, while the second discovery is a way to facilitate the delivery process.
Just focus with me for a bit.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, only by being present in the delivery month.
This means they don't come on the eighth day, because the eighth day is dangerous and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful about walking barefoot.
If she's on time.
"I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the Accursed. And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop on you fresh dates."
We already know Mary, and we know that her provision comes to her.
But I even discussed it with scholars, who told me: Why are you changing the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?
I told them, I am presenting to you the idea that God has placed in this science and that He inspires in me.
Shake the palm tree trunk towards you, when the tree shakes, what does it look like?
It's sharp like nails or thorns.
When you shake a palm tree, it gives an order to the wombs, the area of the wombs, here in the middle.
It's the intestines. They issue orders to facilitate childbirth and the re-seating of the fetus.
Elevating the fetus's head or repositioning it so that it can exit naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
Grasp the hand and begin to relax it.
Some take it as a practice, others know it as a science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you, and you don't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If someone wants to get in touch with you, or if anyone wants to contact you, or if you have a specific email address or are yourself.
Alright, the mobile phone number is in the control room, and if anyone wants to reach Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, on Qatar TV numbers, so he can call us and get this number.
I was created solely to serve people.
If we believe in this conviction, God will bless your work and lead people.
I have sins like the rest of the people and I do everything you can imagine, I'm a regular human being.
But we aspire to more than that good.
We always think about good things.
Viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
We witnessed a live demonstration of how he detected the diseases this person was suffering from.
And what he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from him, and whoever wants to communicate with him can read about him online.
The way it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or in the coming years, and whether it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you evaluate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in the Gulf countries has become a big problem.
Therefore, we feared that Qatar would become the fifth country alongside them.
This program, frankly, happened when the First Lady was in New York.
I visited Doha and they have a program for this purpose.
They presented it to us, we adopted it and said it was a good thing.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the countries of the world, and this is what we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He stops exercising.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone (proverb).
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience, and thank God that we are today in the stage of closure.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, Abu Obeida School for Boys
Riqia Independent Girls' School
With high spirits.
The family became more aware, and their siblings were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food like them.
The student becomes a transitional culture, transmitting this culture to his home and family.
He goes and tells them, "They gave this to me" or "They taught me this."
The training staff or the person who provided this information to the students,
How did you select him and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many authorities who helped us, may God reward them well.
We have brothers at the diet center who teach them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn cooking, sports, or education about the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
How are these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, where we gathered all the students, boys and girls.
These things are not linked to a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
How are these students dealt with initially!
I initially said the results were satisfactory.
Is it sufficient for there to be three semesters or specific semesters in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts from a reasonable range that includes all properties; boys, girls, independents, and privates.
Because it is not suitable for our culture, environment, and family circumstances, they accept some things for their children and do not accept others.
They want to participate in it primarily, and frankly, that's very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want to be thin, but they imagine it to be impossible.
He says that some actors we see in the movies have slim bodies, which is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
Therefore, one should know the benefits of fruits, and should know that if they consume them, their health will improve, and thus, their mood wil
For fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked their fruits.
So, this is an important point.
It's diversity, and of course they compete, for each school was creative with its different ideas presented by its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We give them guidelines and everyone must innovate.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have a special staff?
We trained them, we trained them.
But teachers added, for example, that some schools like Abu Obeida School said they would dedicate Saturday to student activities.
This is a non-school day, they decide and approve it, and Rqaya's teacher said she will organize a march.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking themselves, as the girls were more skilled
Similarly, I would like to thank Rayan Water for providing free water to all schools, and I thank Rayan Water for this gesture.
Of course, water is much healthier because it needs to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball, and he doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and perhaps some of them want another game, and maybe they don't like team games.
Join us live.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society, welcome.
In which, of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce our dear viewers to multiple sclerosis and what this disease is.
Because this name might also be uncomfortable for us.
And the number of women who obtained that was greater than the number of men.
All available treatments now are preventive treatments.
White blood cells, which are supposed to protect us,
He's killing us by hitting the nerve cells.
Let me make it easy for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, this generally leads to dizziness and double vision, or seeing double.
It also leads to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst cases, it leads to madness, and results in quadriplegia or paraplegia.
Treatments of course.
The most important functions of the body will be severely damaged.
Or from this illness, which is called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say that the disease is transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not epidemic.
It does not pass to children.
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for instance, was exempt from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
There is no cure for this disease yet, as its causes are unknown.
So far, scientists have been unable to discover the cause of the disease, and thus have been unable to find a cure.
The process is currently reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this subject, which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a community where you feel this disease is spreading within a particular group?
Internationally, it was ranked between the top 20 and 40.
For now, the international association concerned with the same disease has reduced this number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started affecting young people up to the age of forty.
But man does not recover from it.
Of course, as an open society, we are receptive to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, so through the community, the Multiple Sclerosis Society in Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There were a large number of people, so I thought about creating a community for this topic.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
As for the rest of the Gulf countries, they range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five or six years ago,
My number was sixty or forty-six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We are not certain it's a virus, that's why we don't want to commit to a particular theory, that's the point.
The other point is how can I know if I'm suffering from it or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm confused, oh! Mr. Abdulaziz is trying to figure out a specific point.
