Jacob was the father of Joseph, who married Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
And her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her to shame before the people. So he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
And all this has happened to fulfill what the Lord said through the prophet:
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the time when Herod was king over Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
They answered, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the Magi secretly, and ascertained from them the exact time when the star had appeared.
So he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
And when the wise men had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
And when they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
And after the wise men were gone, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose and went by night to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
And they remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Then Herod, when he realized that he had been deceived by the wise men, became furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old or less, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
And so were fulfilled the words which the prophet Jeremiah had spoken, saying:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
And after Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, where he was.
Then the angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, and he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
And people went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the whole region around the Jordan.
And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you, out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe is already placed at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But one who is more powerful than I will come after me; I am not worthy to untie his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
With the winnowing fan in his hand, he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." - The Baptism of Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this, to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
And after Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up from the water. And behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Temptation of Jesus
The Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus felt hungry.
Then the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
So he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate and worship me, I will give you all this."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. And Jesus began to preach.
And John was put in prison. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
And so was fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah, who said:
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! O Galilee, where non-Jews dwell! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come and follow me, and I will make you a fisher of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then he went on a little further and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And he called them.
So they left the boat and their father immediately and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, those possessed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics. And he healed them all.
And a great multitude followed him. And many came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
And seeing the multitudes, Jesus went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him.
Then he began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing good. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you because of me. Blessed are you also when they say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me."
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great. So they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth; you are the light of the world.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
"You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden."
Likewise, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
"Likewise, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gave the law its full meaning."
"Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen from the law will vanish until all things are accomplished.
"Do not neglect even the smallest commandment, and do not teach others to do so. For if you do, you will be considered the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Rather, practice these commandments and teach them. Then you will be considered important in the kingdom of heaven."
"This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, or you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13). Everyone who commits murder will be accountable.
But I tell you, do not be angry with your brother; whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘You fool,’ will be liable to the Sanhedrin. And whoever says, ‘You fool,’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
"So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Lay your gift on the altar. Go first and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your gift.
"Suppose someone has a grievance against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still with him on the way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison."
What I'm going to tell you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny you have! Adultery
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'" (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye should mislead you, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you that you lose one of your limbs than that your whole body be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"It is written: 'When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce.' (Deuteronomy 24:1)"
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
"Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: 'Do not break the covenant that the Lord your God has made with you. Keep the oath that you swore to him.'"
But this is what I am telling you. Never make such promises at all. Don't make them in the name of heaven. For this is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth. This is the seat upon which the feet of God rest. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
"Let the word 'yes' mean 'yes' only. Let the word 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more is from the evil one. Be kind to others."
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'" (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21).
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
Suppose someone sues you for your shirt. Let him have your coat as well.
Assume someone forces you to walk a mile. Go two miles with them.
"Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn away him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies."
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.'"
But I say to you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
"If you love those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Even tax collectors do the same."
"So if you only greet your brothers, what special thing are you doing compared to others? Even the hypocrites do that."
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Providing assistance to those in need.
"Beware of doing your good deeds publicly, to be seen by others. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
"When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
"When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your charity should be in secret. So your Father who sees in secret will reward you. For He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that people may see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
"When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
"When you pray, do not babble as the hypocrites do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words."
Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need even before you ask Him.
"This is how you should pray." 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
"But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face."
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who cannot be seen, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store your treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light."
But what if your eye is evil? All your body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
"No one can serve two masters at the same time. For either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious."
"I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food? Are there not more important things for the body than clothes?"
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why do you worry about clothes? Look at how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin cloth."
But that is what I am telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these flowers.
"If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
Therefore do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
Wicked people lust after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Be fair when judging others.
Do not judge others, lest you be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be evaluated by the same measure by which you evaluate others.
You look at the splinter in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend: "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," when you have a splinter in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
"Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you."
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door will open for him who knocks.
"If your son asks for bread, which one of you would give him a stone?"
Or suppose he asked for a fish, who among you would give him a live one?
"So if you, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!"
"Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and the small gates."
Enter through the narrow gate into the kingdom of God, for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and few are those who find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You can tell their true nature by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven."
"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' Wise and foolish builders.
"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. Water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
"But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand."
It rains. Water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. It falls with a loud noise.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Jesus Healing a Man with a Skin Disease
Jesus came down from the mountain, and a large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do so."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing; be clean." Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
So he said, "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
So the centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
"I myself am a man subject to authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
"I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven, sitting with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
"But as for those who think they own the kingdom, they will be driven out into the darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth."
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And at that very moment his servant was healed. Jesus heals many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
And when evening had come, they brought to him many who were possessed with demons. And he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
He did this to make what the prophet Isaiah said come true. He said, "He took on himself the pain that should have been ours. He bore the diseases that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus requires sacrifices.
And Jesus saw the multitudes around Him, and commanded His disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then one of the scribes came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another disciple said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept over the lake, and the waves began to crash against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
So the disciples came to him and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us, we are perishing!"
He answered them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus reached the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes. There he met two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, a large group of pigs were feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Then Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
So those who were tending the pigs fled and reported this in the town and in the countryside, and told about everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus healing a man who could not walk
Jesus got into the boat, crossed over, and came to his own city.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes within themselves said, "This man speaks blasphemy!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven"? Or "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the man who was unable to walk, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house!"
The man stood up and went home.
And when the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving humans such power. Jesus chooses when.
And Jesus went on from there, and saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose and followed Him.
And afterward Jesus sat at a meal in the house of Matthew. And many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and asked Jesus, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People do not patch old clothes with new cloth, for the new will pull away from the old, thus making the tear even wider.
"People do not pour new wine into old wineskins, or the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
So Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
At that time, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a disease that made her bleed blood. This disease had lasted for 12 years. She touched the hem of his clothes.
She said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not lose hope. Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house, he saw the flute players and the mourners.
He said, "Go, the girl is not dead, but sleeping." And they laughed at him.
After the crowd was led outside, he went in, took her hand, and the girl stood up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
And Jesus went from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when Jesus came into the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Go, for this is the provision you have been seeking."
And they could see again. And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and could not speak.
And when the demon had gone out, the man spoke, and the crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed every disease and affliction.
And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were weary and worn out, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest field."
Jesus sent the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
William, Philip, and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, and two others, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
"Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a suitcase for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If that house welcomes you, grant it a blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town."
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah will be lighter than the fate of that city.
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves, so be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves."
"Beware! People will hand you over to the local courts, and they will flog you in their assemblies.
You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, and will be a witness to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you are to say or how you are to say it; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour.
You will not be the speaker. It is the spirit of your father that will speak through you.
"Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their sons. Children will rise against their parents and cause their death.
Everyone will hate you because of me, but whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
"When they persecute you in one place, flee to another. What I tell you is true: You will not finish visiting the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
"A student is not better than his teacher. Nor is a servant better than his master."
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household?
"So do not be afraid of your enemies. For everything that is hidden will be revealed, and everything that is covered will be made known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
"Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Therefore do not fear, for you are of more value than many sparrows.
"What about the person who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him."
But what about the person who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set "sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and wives against their mothers-in-law."
"A man's foes are they of his own household" (Micah 7:6).
"Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
"Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."
Let's assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And let's assume that someone welcomes a righteous man as a righteous man. That person will receive the reward of a righteous man.
Let's suppose someone offered even a glass of cold water to a small child following me. What I'm about to tell you is the truth. That person will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. The poor have the good news preached to them.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the person who was written about in the Holy Bible. It says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is Elijah who was to come.
Let him who has ears listen.
"What shall I compare the people of this age to? They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling out to one another."
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, but you did not mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do, and people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you. And people said, "This man eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities that do not turn from sin.
And Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be judged less severely than you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you this: it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. That's what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to introduce him to.
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
"Be my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is against the law, working on the Sabbath!"
Jesus answered them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed for the priests to eat.
Haven't you read the law? It states how the priests in the temple are to perform their duties every Sabbath day. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that someone greater than the temple is here.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Then he left there and entered their synagogue.
And there was a man whose hand was withered and distorted. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus, so they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
So he said to them, "If your child were to fall into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn't you pull them out?"
"Man is more valuable than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus was aware of all the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
And this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said:
"Behold, My servant whom I have chosen, My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased. I will put My Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't extinguish a flickering flame. He'll fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him" (Isaiah 42:1-4). Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul, so by whose power do your followers cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
"Or think about this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take what the man has, unless you first bind him? Then you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
"If the tree is good, its fruit will be good. If the tree is bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit."
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks good things. These things come from the good that he puts within himself. A wicked man speaks wicked things. These things come from the wickedness that he puts within himself.
But that is what I am telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every reckless word they have spoken.
"You will be condemned or acquitted based on your words." The sign of Jonah's miracle.
And the Pharisees and scribes came to him, saying, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
He answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
"The men of Nineveh will stand in the judgment day with the people who are living now. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now, someone greater than Jonah is here."
"The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, one greater than Solomon is here."
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It passes through dry places, looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives there, he finds the house empty. It has been cleaned, swept, and put in order.
Then the evil spirit goes out and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. As a result, that person's final state becomes worse than the first. So will it be with this evil generation." Jesus' mother and brothers arrived.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
"Everyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. And all the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
And some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
But other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
As for the other seeds, they fell on good soil and produced a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.
"Let him who has ears listen."
The students came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. This opportunity has not been given to outsiders.
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have too much. Those who do not have this kind of knowledge will have even their little bit taken away.
And that's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
"In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah the prophet, who said: 'You will indeed hear, but you will never understand. You will indeed see, but you will never perceive.'"
"Their hearts have become callous, their ears are dull and their eyes are closed, so they cannot see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn back to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
What I am going to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky ground. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy at once.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long, and when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they quickly fall away.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but the worries of this life and the deceitful wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. - Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
"So the servants of the landowner came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?'"
He answered, "An enemy has done this." And the servants asked him, "Shall we go and pull them up?"
"No," the owner replied. "While weeding, you might uproot the wheat along with the weeds.
Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." - The Parable of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke to the crowds using parables, telling them all these things. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
And so the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explained the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
So they will be cast into the blazing Hellfire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and went and sold all that he had and bought that field."
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
So he went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together all kinds of fish.
And when it was full, they drew it up on the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But the bad fish they threw away.
Thus it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come and separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They are thrown into the blazing fire, where they weep and gnash their teeth.
And Jesus asked them, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered him, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
And he came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, "Where does this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
And there he did few miracles because of their unbelief.
Beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch, who ruled Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife, because that would be against the law."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was greatly pleased with her.
So he swore to her that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. But he thought of his promise and his guests whom he had invited for dinner. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
And his head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. Then she carried it to her mother.
And John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them, and he healed their sick.
And in the evening his disciples came to him and said, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
Then Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
And they all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate also. Jesus walked on water.
And Jesus immediately commanded His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, to Bethsaida. Then He dismissed the crowd.
And after sending them away, he went up into the mountain to pray by himself. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing against it.
Jesus went out to the disciples early in the morning. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. They said, "It's a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
Jesus immediately called out to them: "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid!"
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "tell me to come to you on the water."
Then Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus immediately reached out His hand and grabbed him, saying, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt Me?"
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
And they crossed the lake and came to the land of Gennesaret.
And the men who lived there recognized Jesus. They sent a message to all the surrounding countryside. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
And they asked him to allow the sick to touch only the hem of his clothes, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
And some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus, and asked him,
"Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commandments of God? But you prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17;azazazazazazazazazazazazazaz
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
Therefore they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect in order to keep your own tradition.
"You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." It is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered them, "There are some plants that my Father in heaven did not plant; they will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
"Do you not see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the belly and then out of the body."
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." The faith of a Canaanite woman.
Jesus left the region of Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near the cities of Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon and is suffering terribly."
And Jesus remained silent. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, saying, "Send her away, for she is following us and crying out."
Jesus replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him, saying, "Oh Lord! Help me!"
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus departed from there and walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up into the hills and sat down.
And great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at His feet, and He healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to talk. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd, for they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish."
Then Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
So he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples. Then the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples then gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus was asked to provide a miraculous sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven to prove his miraculous power.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky and say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
And you say in the morning, "Today there will be a storm," because of the red sky and its clouds. You know the meaning of what you see in the sky, but you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The disciples crossed to the other side of the lake, and they had forgotten to bring bread.
Then Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
And the disciples spoke to each other, saying, "He must have said this because we did not bring bread with us."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Don't you yet understand? Don't you remember the five loaves of bread and the five thousand men? And how many baskets full of pieces you picked up?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? How many baskets full of fragments did you gather?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "John the Baptist," some said; others said, "Elijah," and others, "Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
So Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He must be killed, and on the third day he will rise again.
And Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said to him, "No, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?"
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory, and his angels with him, and then he will reward each according to his works.
"What I am about to tell you is the truth. Some of you standing here will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus was transformed during his transfiguration.
And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
And there before them his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.
And suddenly there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground in fear.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
And they came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man what they had seen, until the Son of man had risen from the dead.
And his disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but treated him however they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands."
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
And as they came near to the multitude, a man ran to Jesus, and fell on his knees before him.
He said, "Oh Lord, have mercy on my son, for he trembles greatly and suffers much, and often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
Then Jesus answered, "O you of little faith, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, that is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'यरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयर

And they met together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. He asked, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or taxes? From their sons or from人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人
"From others," Peter answered. Jesus said to him, "Then the children are free."
