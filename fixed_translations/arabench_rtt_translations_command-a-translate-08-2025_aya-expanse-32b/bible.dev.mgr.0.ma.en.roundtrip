Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram, and Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham, and Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jews were taken captive to Babylon.
And after that, the family line continued. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Azariah, and Azariah the father of Jehohanan.
Azor was the father of Zadok, and Zadok was the father of Akim, and Akim was the father of Eliud.
Eliakim was the father of Elishama, and Elishama the father of Azel, and Azel the father of Eleazar.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from that time until Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her in front of people. So he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"You shall give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All of this is happening so that what Allah said would happen comes true. Allah said this through the prophet:
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time when Herod was king. After his birth, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
They answered, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the wise men secretly, and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they continued on their journey. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with a great joy.
The wise men went to the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their hometown by another route. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
After the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel from God appeared to him. The angel said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph stood up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
And they remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled the word of God spoken by the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” (Hosea 11:1)
Then Herod, when he realized that he had been deceived by the wise men, became furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old or less, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
And so were fulfilled the words which the prophet Jeremiah had spoken. He had said:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, and she refuses to be comforted for them, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
And he lived there in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said by the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came to him from Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from the whole region around the Jordan River.
And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing people. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit that proves your repentance from your sins.
"You do not think you can say to yourselves, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones."
The axe is originally at the roots of trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
He has a pitchfork in his hand to separate the chaff from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the husks with a fire that cannot be quenched. "Jesus is baptized."
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is being tempted.
The Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus felt hungry.
And the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
And then Satan took Jesus to the holy city, and set him on the highest point of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" (Deuteronomy 6:13).
And after that, the devil left Jesus. The angels came and took care of him. Jesus started calling people.
Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent word to
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled: He said,
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!"
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Those living in a land of deep darkness will experience a shining light." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
From there, he saw two other disciples, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them.
So they left their boats and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were under the control of demons. Some were trembling violently. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him, including people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up the mountain. There he sat down, and his disciples came to him.
And then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who need spiritual things. The kingdom of heaven is theirs."
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing good. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in heaven is great. People always do the same thing, they persecute the prophets who lived before. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But what if salt loses its saltiness? How can it become salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people."
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Most people don't light a candle and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on top of their stove. That way, it lights up the whole house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good works you do. And they will glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gave full meaning to the law.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter of the law passes away. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will pass away from the law until everything is accomplished.
"Do not even break the least of these commandments. And do not teach people to break them. If you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep and teach these commandments, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. Otherwise, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder"
You have heard what was said to those who lived long ago: ‘Do not murder’ (Exodus 20:13). Anyone who murders will be liable to judgment.
But I tell you, do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
"Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you."
Leave your gift there in front of the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
"If someone has a claim against you and wants to take you to court, settle this matter quickly. Do this while you are still together on your way. If you don't do this, they might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the police officer. And you might end up in jail."
What I'm about to tell you is true. You won't get out until you pay the last cent! Adultery.
"You have heard that it was said: 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)"
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is only a part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell."
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you swore to him."
But that is what I am telling you. Never make any such promises at all. Don't make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth. For this is the throne upon which God places His feet. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. For this is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
"Let your 'yes' be 'yes,' and your 'no' be 'no.' Anything more than this comes from the evil one. Be kind to others."
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'" (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21).
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
Well, if one person is taking you to court to get your shirt, let him take your jacket too.
If someone wants you to go one mile, go two miles with them.
"Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn away from those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies."
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor.' (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless those who curse you.
"And with this, your children will reach for the sky. He who makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, who sends winter upon those who do good and those who don't."
"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do that."
If you only greet your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Even the unbelievers do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Providing assistance to those in need.
"Be careful not to do good deeds publicly, just to be seen by others. Don't do them to be noticed. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you."
“When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.”
"When you give something to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
"Don't pray if you are going to be like those who show off their piety. They love to stand and pray in the mosque and in the street corners so that people can see them. This is what I am telling you now: they have received their reward in full."
“When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Your Father sees in secret.
"When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Don't be like them. You know what you need even before you ask.
"This is how you should pray." "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
We have preserved those who sin when they are tempted. Save us from the evil one who is evil.
"Forgive people if they wrong you. If you do that, your Father who is in heaven will forgive you as well."
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
"If you fast and do not eat, do not be like the hypocrites, who make themselves look sad to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward in full."
But when you don't eat, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
And so others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will know. And he will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up your treasures in heaven.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasures are.
"The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and not like the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not even think about it.
"I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food? And is the body more important than clothes?"
"Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap, they do not gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they?"
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
"And why are they worried about clothing? Look at how wildflowers grow. They don't work and they don't make clothes."
But that is what I am telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these flowers.
"If God so clothes the grass of the field, will He not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? For the grass is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven. How much more will He clothe you!"
"Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'"
People who don't have faith run after all these things. The One in heaven knows you need them.
"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
"You see only the splinter in your friend's eye, but you do not see the log in your own eye."
How can you tell your friend: "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," when you have a splinter in your own eye?
"You are a hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
"They asked to be given, they searched to find, they knocked and the door was opened to them."
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will open for him who knocks.
Imagine if your son asked for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or suppose he asked for a fish, would any of you give him a live one?
"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
"In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates."
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and few are those who find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You can tell their true nature by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven."
"On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" Wise builders and fools.
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It's raining. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and hitting this house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
It's raining. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and hitting that house. And it's making a loud crashing sound.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught with authority. He did not speak like their teachers of the law.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. And a large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to him and fell on his knees before Jesus. "Lord," he said, "if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I want to do this. Be clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came down to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded with him to help.
He said, "O Lord, my servant lies at home, unable to move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
So the centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority. I have soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
"I am telling you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast of the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
And when evening had come, they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
This all fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had foretold: “He took up our pain and bore our diseases” (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus comes at a cost.
Jesus saw the large crowd that was following him, so he told his disciples to get into a boat and go ahead to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another disciple said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a strong storm blew across the lake. The waves began to strike the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils and Vicq walked. They said to him, "Sir, help us! We're going to drown!"
He answered them, "How little faith you have! Why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. He encountered two men possessed by demons, coming from the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far from there, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
And those who were tending the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who was unable to walk.
Jesus got into a boat and crossed to the other side of the lake to his town.
They brought to him a man paralyzed; he was lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
And then some of the Sharia scholars said among themselves: "This man is saying something very bad!"
Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Is it easy to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or should we say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. He said to him, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house."
The man got up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed. They praised God, who had given people such authority. Jesus called Matthew.
And Jesus went on from there, and saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose and followed Him.
Afterward, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house, and many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked Jesus' disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick."
Walk and learn what this means: “I desired mercy, not sacrifice” (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” Jesus asks about fasting.
One day, John's disciples came to Jesus and said, "John's disciples and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
"People don't sew a new patch on old clothes. The new patch will tear away from the old. This will make the tear worse."
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. That way, both are preserved." A dead daughter and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus stood up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
At that time, a woman came from behind Jesus. She was suffering from a disease that caused her to bleed, and this disease had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his garment.
I thought: "I just need to touch his clothes, and I'll be healed."
Jesus came to her and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not lose hope." "Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw flute players there. He saw the crowded and noisy audience.
He said, "Go, the girl is not dead, but asleep." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had gone, Jesus entered and took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
And they could see again. And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
As they were going out, they brought to Jesus a man who was mute and possessed by a demon.
When the demon had left him, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of the demons." How few workers there are!
Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed every disease and infirmity.
When the people increased in number, he felt a deep concern for them. They were helpless and had no one to help them; they seemed like sheep without a shepherd.
And afterward Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the laborers are few."
Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
William, Philip, and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
And the last was Judas the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, proclaim this message: “The kingdom of heaven is near.”
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
"Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take any luggage with you on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. A worker should only take what he needs.
"When you enter a town or village, seek out someone willing to host you. Stay in that person's home until you leave."
When you enter the house, greet the people who live there.
If that house welcomes you, grant it a blessing of peace. If not, do not bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town."
What I'm about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this city.
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves."
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
They will bring you governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses against them and against those who do not believe.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you are to say or how you are to say it; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour.
It won't be you who speaks. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
"The brother will hand over his brother to be killed. The father will hand over his children. The son will rise up against his parents and will leave them to be killed."
I'll make you all regret it because of me. But I'll endure until the end and succeed.
"If people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not have finished visiting the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
There is no student better than his teacher. There is no servant better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and enough for the slave to become like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more so his household?
"So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be revealed, and everything that is secret will be made known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light. What whispers to you in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
He even counts the hairs on your head!
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
"As for those who say in front of others that they know me, what about that? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him."
But what about the person who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to make "sons rebel against their fathers. Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers. Daughters-in-law will rebel against their mothers-in-law.
"A man's foes are they of his own household" (Micah 7:6).
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me does not deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life because of me will find it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
If someone receives a prophet as a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
Imagine if someone were to give even a cup of cold water to a little child following me. What I am about to tell you is true. That person will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples, and then went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Solo Isa: Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we wait for someone else?
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see.
Blind people see. Disabled people walk. People with skin diseases are healed. Deaf people hear. Dead people come back to life. And good news is told to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
And when John's disciples had departed, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes live in the palaces of kings.
So, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one who was written about in the Holy Book. It says: "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
"What I'm about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is Elijah who was to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
"Who can I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to each other, saying:
"We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, but you did not mourn."
As soon as John arrived, I didn't eat or drink like you. And people say: "He has a jinn."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you. And people said, "This man eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities that do not turn from sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because the people there did not repent of their sins. He said:
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be judged less severely than you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. "Comfort for all who mourn"
Then Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to introduce to him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick and eat the wheat.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed for the priests to eat.
Haven't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath the priests in the temple perform their duties on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that someone greater than the temple is here.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
And after that, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus, so they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
The man is worth more than the sheep! That's why this law allows us to do good on Saturday.
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus was aware of all the plots of the Pharisees. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
"Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim justice to the nations."
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
It won't break a bent branch. It won't extinguish a flickering flame. It will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not speak, possessed by a demon. Jesus healed him, and afterward the man could speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
They say, "This one casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul!" But why don't you say, "By the power of whom do those who cast them out cast them out?" Those will be the judges between you.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
"Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what the man has without first binding him? Then you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
Therefore, I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come.
"If you plant a good tree, its fruit will be good. If you plant a bad tree, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the good in his heart. A bad man speaks bad words. This comes from the evil in his heart.
But that is what I am telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every reckless word they have spoken.
"You will be condemned or acquitted based on your words." The sign of Jonah's miracle.
And the Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus, and said unto him, "Master, we desire to see a sign from thee."
He answered, "The evil and faithless demand a sign! But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. The same will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
"The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation. The Ninevites will prove that this generation is guilty. When Jonah preached to them, the men of Nineveh repented of their sins. Now there is someone greater than Jonah here."
"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."
"What happens when the evil spirit leaves a man? It goes to dry places to look for a resting place, but it doesn't find one."
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit returns with seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. So the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation." - Jesus and his brothers
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside. They wanted to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
"Anyone who does what my father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
That day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. And all the people stood on the shore.
And then he told them a lot of things through stories. He said: "There was a farmer who went out to sow his seeds.
Scatter the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
But other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And other seeds fell on good soil. They grew and produced a hundred times, sixty times, or thirty times as much as was planted.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
The students came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He replied, "You have been given an opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. This opportunity has not been given to outsiders.
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have plenty. As for those who don't have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said: "You will indeed hear, but you will never understand. You will indeed see, but you will never perceive."
"And the hearts of these people have grown dull. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes, otherwise they would see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear."
What I'm about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seeds planted on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky ground. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy at once.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not endure for long. They soon fall away from the faith when problems or persecution comes because of the message.
Others receive the seed that falls among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of this life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke it out. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest of 100, 60, or 30 times what was planted. Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man sowed good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
"And his servants came unto him, and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?"
"That's what an enemy would do," he replied. The servants asked, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
"No," the owner replied. "While weeding, you might uproot the wheat along with the weeds.
Let them grow in pairs until harvest time. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Tie them into bundles to burn. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." Mustard Seed and Yeast
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took it and planted it in his field."
This is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the entire garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until all of the dough had risen."
Jesus told people all these things through parables. He didn't say anything to them without telling a story.
And so the words of the prophet were fulfilled, who said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things kept since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explained the parable of the weeds.
And after Jesus went away from the people and entered the house, his disciples came to him and said to him, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is on the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
"My son, do not reject the discipline of the Lord, and do not despise his rebuke. For the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in." "He will drive out all wickedness from his kingdom. And those who are righteous will inherit the kingdom and dwell there forever." "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."
They will be thrown into the blazing fire of Hell, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those with ears listen. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, hid it again, and went and sold everything he had to buy that field."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
One of them found a pearl of great value. He went and sold all that he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
When they had done this, the fishermen pulled the net to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets, but they threw the bad fish away.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come and separate those who did evil from those who did good.
They release the scum onto the people like a burning oven. There, the scum will be gathered and they will gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked them. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
And he came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, "Where does this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all this?
They were never satisfied with him. But Isa said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country. He does not find any appreciation in his own house."
There were just a few miracles because they didn't believe.
Beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife, because that would be against the law."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At the feast for Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests, and he was delighted with her.
So he swore to give her everything she asked of him.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. However, he remembered his promise and the guests he had invited for dinner. So, he ordered one of his men to give her what she had asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and delivered to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
And John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he got into a boat and went off to a solitary place. When the people heard this, they followed him on foot from their towns.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
And in the evening his disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the time is now late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
They answered, "We have only five loaves and two fish."
He said, "Bring them here."
And afterward, Jesus said to the people, "Sit down on the grass." He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to his disciples. The disciples then gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate also. Jesus walked on water.
And Jesus immediately commanded His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, to Bethsaida. Then He sent the multitude away.
And after he had sent them away, he went up into the mountain to pray by himself. And when evening was come, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went to the disciples. And he walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and ran away in fear.
Jesus immediately called out to them: "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid!"
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus immediately reached out His hand and grabbed him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they got into the boat, the wind died down.
And those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and came to Gennesaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. They sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow the patients to touch only the hem of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
And some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. And they asked him,
"Why don't your students practice what their elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commandment of God, but prefer to follow your own teachings?"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
So they don't need to honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God to follow your own teachings.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right about you when he said:
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. For they teach nothing but human rules" (Isaiah 29:13).
Jesus called to the crowds and said to them, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." It is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
And his disciples came to him. And they asked him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not sow. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand yet?" asked Jesus.
"Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. And then it comes out of the body."
But the words that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
Those are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." The faith of a Canaanite woman.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near the cities of Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him, saying, "Oh, sir! Help me!"
He replied: "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus fed four thousand people.
Jesus went from there. He walked beside the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a mountain and sat down.
He had great multitudes come to him, bringing him blind people and those who could not walk. They brought him cripples, people who could not speak, and many others. They placed them before him, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. Those who were blind began to see. And the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and some small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up seven baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus was asked to perform a miracle as proof.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven to prove his miraculous power.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
And when you see the morning, you say: "Today there will be a storm, the sky is red and overcast." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! And no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The students walked to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils spoke about this among themselves, saying, "He must have said this because we did not bring bread with us."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "Your faith is very small. Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you think about those five loaves that fed five thousand? Don't you remember the number of baskets you filled with the pieces?
Don't you remember the seven loaves of the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And then the disciples understood that Jesus was not asking them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but was warning them about what the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And Jesus warned his disciples that they should tell no one that he was the Christ. Jesus spoke of his coming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised to life.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What good is it for a person to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can a person give in exchange for their soul?"
"The son of man will come in the glory of his Father, and with him will be his angels. And then he will reward each according to what they have done."
What I am about to tell you is true. Some of the people standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' features changed as he appeared.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And there before them his appearance was altered. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths. One for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they were very afraid. They fell to the ground on their faces.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "That is true. Elijah is supposed to come and make everything new again.
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but treated him however they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
The disciples began to understand that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
And when they came near to the multitude, a man knelt down before Jesus.
He said, "O Lord, have mercy on my son, for he trembles greatly and suffers much. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
Then Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
And afterward Jesus' disciples came to him in the fields, and said to him, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is very weak. What I am about to tell you is the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They met in Galilee. And afterward Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again after he dies." After this speech, the disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus was paying the temple tax.
When Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or taxes? From their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. Jesus said to him, "Then the children are free."
"But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the coin you need exactly. Take it and give it to them as a tax for you and me."
