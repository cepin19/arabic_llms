This is a no-brainer! It's an opportunity for all of us to benefit.
I don't interfere, my right to own, and your right to own before me.
khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa
Armed, don't be ... May God forgive me!
In the name of God, would a brother advise his sibling with what you're saying?

And you found a great dinner.
The party doesn't belong to anyone.
Say this to yourself.
This festival will not appear before us again.
Don't be strange, Sallem.
And take the opportunity away from us.
No, no, no, no, you're not going to manipulate me, maybe, maybe, I won't do that.
The thing is, he's afraid.
Afraid of what?
This is a government project! Everyone takes.
This is the rule!
Even those they meet benefit from it.
He is the head of a large project.
This means he's in control.
The international seas for the third millennium, in a sense, meaning the first phase of the infrastructure.
A liar like this
There's something to exploit!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the authority?
You don't have the right to benefit from it.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who was to be used to be used on the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you have the right.
Who gives you money to work on your car four and five times!
I'll finish it for you.
Do not be a teller, and do not be insistent.
Take advantage of some benefits.
Look at my Thursday.
And now, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
One third of the project
The other third is the reward.
Who plays in a popular band,
They say there's a national celebration.
And he completed a hundred lamps.
You know what they did.
We added zero.
No sense, my sister!
No, God will move him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
This is an opportunity.
In the interest of achieving the goal.
And if God wills, good will prevail.
This is common.
Keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about this.
Do we need to worry?
But my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two hours in the morning.
He began to convince.
We'll meet him later.
And we have to convince him.
This cuts into our advantages.
They really turned the tide of his opinion in the meeting.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day of work.
I count on you.
How could you not get it!
Undoubtedly. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you
If you are tired and walking in the street
Do you speak? Or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The tile is large.
We're still working on the first article for the meeting.
If you are sick.
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
It's legitimate.
"May God guide you, O Salam."
This is logical because you become a president for the first time in your life.
This is very simple.
Our projects will include
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So no one doubts what we're doing.
Add our participation as a separate clip!
This amount of money was stolen.
"I am naming it Project X."
Cannot
No, no, no! Ah! Surrender!
You know how these things are.
But it seems you have some fear.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend and that you can trust him.
He said!
We say it's his friend's car.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear that from people.
He informed me that he had purchased the land and registered it in his name.
He said "please."
He has the money now.
Now he will spread lies.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Are we getting something?
It'll end up with nothing!
He wants to eat it alone, spoon.
Don't stick your head out!
Your brother is not
You will surrender, and everything will be enough for you.
I talked to him all night.
She told him they were his family no matter what.
He finally agreed.
This is how things should be.
And I hope you get it just once.
This is the third edition of the International Beach Games.
More precisely, infrastructure.
After that, they will begin the second phase.
And it will continue with him.
By the mercy of God, He seeks refuge in you.
Excellent that you pushed him to accept it.
You are no different from them.
But, don't worry.
I wish you had clarified it.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said even after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend a meeting to set the project budget.
They must follow up, because it's their money.
We set and make sure of that.
Send it back for approval as soon as possible.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my brother-in-law who shares with me.
Do you mean that?
Responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to the fitting of buildings.
Good, good
How much do you want, so we can finish?
How much will you get?
Is this that we take the money?
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And determine the amount of money we get.
Who steps aside and lets others take charge?
Abideth sound.
If someone decides to take half a million.
During our week, everyone is thinking carefully.
He specified the amount he wanted.
In a week, they will move on to thinking and figuring out what they want.
It's not your responsibility.
Then, it depends on you?
Ignore him.
Hello friend, what? What's wrong with him?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Salih, the name of the brother is Sultan!
This is the neighbor's traveler.
Sometimes he drives us when our car isn't working.
Write it.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are 3 other people.
What remains for me to do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Propose the budget and let's wrap this up."
No, no, this is Mr. Halawa's money.
How much should I charge him?
Welcome him, does he have children?
Yes, it was, make it five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much will you get for them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, this is the last one, son!
Oh no! My son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's the problem?
Why are you laughing?
Simply from the first stage, infrastructure in particular.
Not used
Add three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand that have dazzling strass.
Did you add it to her?
Yes, Mother.
No mom, I added it, I just wanted to make sure of the name.
Father, Mother
Write "Learn about food."
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting, and everyone should decide on the amount of money they want.
I simplified this.
Is a million enough?!
This is exaggerated, my dear.
Oh! Friends, oh! Friends, wait, it's noise, give us a chance.
The committee is in session now to adopt the project budget. Don't discuss financial matters now, this is all that concerns him.
I want more.
I'm telling you, you're not hurting us, we're in a ministry garden.
Ah, we're screaming, don't mind us.
If someone came and asked him what your people are suffering here
We tell him that the electricity is cut off or disrupted.
Do not use sound in the production area.
Lock %pw Lock %pw
I'll fix it! Do you hear me!
"I was with them, what's the budget now?"
Without me, brother.
Fully, 50 million percent
Fifty million is enough for the first phase.
What time is it now?
What, hello
Come on, man!
In any case, enjoy!
Faster, let's work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The main thing is, we don't want any discussions, they agree on the budget and that's it.
And it will start implementing tomorrow.
Works on a large segment of society.
With great pleasure, I am delighted to present to you this international project for the beaches of the third century.
This is the first stage.
More precisely, infrastructure.
This is for the future generation.
Certainly, we extend our greetings and appreciation from our team for the launch of the program today, as I understand it.
Which took us a year and a half.
Two and a half years
Once again, in the name of the Future Accomplished program,
This project
And future generations
Prepare the best oil for our servants.
Second, third, and decimal stages.
actor
Welcome aboard.
When they gathered...
What? Where does it take us?
Thank God, you worshipped and worshiped.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a polite girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did she hurry you?
Aman told me that my sister Munira is this one.
My grandfather's land in the desert
I wonder who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
What is it that the earth...
You saw a farm in the desert and imagined it was your father's farm.
Besides, why are you asking about these things?
You have brothers.
Those who work hard, invest in land, real estate, and businesses, and make an effort.
The end of the headache.
I'm surprised by you, Iman.
And also, my sister.
How could you not know?
They must give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And nothing is better than the truth.
Because money
Now we help her and take her to the doctor.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her siblings in schools.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No, but
Salam's brothers are accelerators.
No, she told me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I'm not saying your sisters are like her, I hope they aren't.
How many years after my father's death?
Why are you asking for it now?
And she saw the farm.
What does he want otherwise?
Is the amount paid to her every three months?
Calm down, Saqr, let's understand the story first.
It's not enough for her.
If it were from someone else, his sisters wouldn't get a single penny.
I am simplifying.
Where from?
As if it had never been my religion.
Sure, Monira.
Please look at him.
Becomes one hundred thousand
Because I had the courage to ask him about my father's land, the land in the desert.
I'm sure my contribution is more than that.
Everyone lives in this building.
Their children are in the best schools.
What I'm saying, Munira.
I will continue to resist for my right.
I will get my rights.
"The best way to invest your money in the company! No thanks."
Everyone fights with each other.
People are not given mercy for certain.
Don't think your brother will be better than me.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go regularly.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from any of that.
Why are they doing that?
That's why I tell you, my dear, come after them.
Act with mercy towards them.
And you will get tired of them.
And does it take the courts a long time?
We'll be four hundred thousand altogether.
If we reach millions like other countries.
I really doubt, dear, that an order will be issued.
Look at my sisters.
I swear I don't want all this.
My darling!
I can say that God alone is enough for us, and He is the best in arranging things for us.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us.
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, my dear!
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times.
My dear, millions will move, you will only see what they do.
As I've told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And he will take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'll be satisfied with what they give me.
Because she is the lady.
We don't owe you anything.
Men ask you!
She owns some
Simply some questions about her participation and
You just want to know one thing and then go back.
If you don't find him.
I'll walk you through and show you.
He will find his way.
A surrender document
Two hundred and fifty, and it should be enough for her husband, her husband works.
Do it first or forget it.
Why are you asking now?
But he is determined.
As if it's not my right.
These are my father's heirs, and the house decides how much I take or leave.
It's not up to me or him to decide.
This is an order from God.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
Because of the money.
It opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, Nasser.
Land, buildings, and real estate are easily identifiable.
I don't know how much they get.
Even the company,
Your right to go and ask anything.
And I don't leave them alone.
How do you get back to them?
It's not your responsibility.
It's not in your hands, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him signing authority.
Who is allowed to inspect everything in the company?
"Saqr, Saad"
He's shouting at us.
"Saquar, enough."
Brother Nasr
I excuse you, I'll take.
Yes, sir.
Absence, now.
I apologize, go.
Don't give him a reason to respond on our behalf.
Now, if he went and testified against us,
He explained that he had hit him.
So, shall we let him do as he pleases!
He has an official document.
Genuine! We can't stop him.
He has the legal right to search everything.
If he looks at the budget and accounts
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If checked against the budget,
Multiply 12 by 8.
Divide it into three.
Thirty-three
You know how much.
This is the amount we are owed by her.
Except for lands and projects
We have the freedom to do anything we want.
We have nothing to fear, we fear nothing.
If he refuses, that's what happened, and if he agrees, then welcome.
"Gather them and come upon them."
He only gives them enough money to live with their sisters.
She is married.
She has a reliable husband.
What does she want to do with the money?
This is what it should have been from the start.
Yes, sir.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, sir.
File after file
When you knew what really inherits her.
Compounds, villas, and lands you have never known.
They proved that there were seven of them.
They proved they were seventeen.
You didn't know.
Without reason, it was a surprise.
It is not fair.
Don't leave them alone.
Please, my son, I don't want to hear about courts.
The more you worry.
The least of a judge
For half a minute
And he moves on to his usual sentence,
Seven, four, two thousand, I don't know how many.
They will be happy with my son.
Never leave your bed, Mother!
In the name of Allah, may He make things easy for you and facilitate your affairs.
No, no, I hope you come.
"Nasir split my skull."
After we closed the door and escaped from the place.
He sends one of my students from my school days.
Abdullah is called.
And now
I will prevent him.
I mean, can it influence them?
Since he will work on it.
Yes, yes, yes
Do not rely on the judiciary.
Courts do only one thing: reports.
Delays and conflicts, unhelpful lawyers
The years pass.
And time passes.
And you will get one real.
May Allah have mercy on Salman's uncle.
She advised me a day before she died.
Never go to court.
He said that our courts
She died without leaving anything to her heirs.
She passed away while the judge had not yet resolved her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello, Abdullah.
Brother Abdullah
Years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
You are becoming more compassionate.
The most important thing
The relationship between siblings.
Brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't allow financial problems.
Are you talking about something other than my sister?
I excuse you.
Why do I ask him to stop talking?
This is true.
They don't even want me to get a share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife
My father is an official in the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We had been waiting for a long time.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them your friend Abdullah.
They disrespected him and even expelled him.
We publish what Sheikh Abdul Rahman does.
He is a very loving man.
Nasser said confidently.
Don't worry.
He scares them with the law.
Did you forget what the weak Salma said about the courts?
Perhaps Sallam's brothers do not fear the courts.
But my brothers
He may have fears of good news.
They might feel guilty about going to court.
We wait and see what will happen after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit to them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What are you saying, my son?
He is telling the truth.
Get out, %pw get out
I will go to court tomorrow morning.
And isn't it enough for me to contemplate it after tomorrow?
It's me who decides, not you.
What happens if you wait day after day?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, I am asked to postpone going to court.
Because they knew you were committed to it, dear.
It's important that we visit your sister, Munira.
What is this?
Ah, you asked me what this is, this.
God bless you all.
A small model for building courts.
God bless you.
And all of you
In Your name, O Lord.
Why didn't you say?
He told you not to go today.
And delay it until after tomorrow.
To obtain this sample, take %pw from the courthouse building.
Prepared to guide you
Enter through this door, this door.
When you enter through the door,
You put everything at your disposal there.
Portable and metal so as not to make noises that keep going on and on and on and on.
The case is recorded, they will ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five seven eight elevator go.
Go around the offices.
Look at the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
Therefore, these
He wants to sue us.
We consider this the way here.
We watch as you fail on the right.
Or take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We'll have dinner at my sister's house today.
Oh, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, he didn't believe her.
He said they agree on the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house.
Thank God, luck comes in pairs.
How happy you are, Abu Waleed.
Lucky in his fortune.
My sister told me that he was so happy that he didn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Oh Manal!
He doesn't know about business affairs, but some good people helped him.
Sure, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the food.
Thank you, Waleed.
Thank you, Abu Walid. May God bless you.
May God complete your life with joy.
Very special food, Um Waleed.
I request an accountant and an assistant to organize your work.
They told me to rent an office, and I'll manage everything.
Please take some, my brothers.
Hello, my dear son.
I want a black berry.
We want a bigger house.
You know, it's one thing at a time, one thing at a time.
Father, wasn't it agreed that you wouldn't speak after the meal?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the author of the project, my father, Bou Walid.
We apologize to you.
Congratulations, Abu Waleed!
You deserve
But, frankly, you don't know anything about business and trade.
Oh! There's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Thank God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know where he is now.
This is a factory manual for multi-purpose halls, we are looking for them, ask them.
Any knot can build this for you.
Does not understand
Any contractor?
Japanese people are excellent.
When you open it, a computer appears on the screen.
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, press Kitchen.
When I presented the file to a ministry committee,
And what about your contract with the factory?
I pay some.
Deposited amount
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I've taken care of it, thank God.
And give me time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bo Fhad's signature.
What the accelerator said.
He said that Bu Fahad didn't appear.
Would you like to drink tea?
Polydore told me, what have you done!
You don't know Bou Fahd, he might come, and maybe he won't.
One day, it will appear.
He doesn't have time.
Turn, turn
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, it needs to be signed.
Intentionally with these plaques in my mosque, all of them need Abu Fahd's signature.
So! What should I do?
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
One hundred five minutes to two! Oh! Boo, Walid.
Time to go home.
I don't think Bu Fahd will finish.
In the name of God, He seeks ease for you, tomorrow.
She said that you have known the manager for a long time and that he is a friend of yours.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
Such a changeable manager, he doesn't do anything.
It's sad that they resemble intelligent men when they are not.
They don't do anything useful.
Are they doing anything? Completely!
No chair moves without Bufehd's consent.
Who didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's questions are pending.
It seems you'll be going back to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems daily.
The factory gave me limited time.
No, I hope not.
And if they ask about you
You're the only one Bou Fahd is waiting for.
Look at these files.
Everyone needs Boo Fhad's signature.
I think he'll move today.
Sit down, children.
Or you walk.
I'll call you when it's ready.
If something happens, I'll call, don't surprise them.
Hello
I'm very sorry, she's my wife.
Oh! Little one, they agreed to my appointments two months ago.
I just need his signature, what's this?
Hello, my son, during the registration period, my daughter will improve her university reward, her documents need to be worked on for verification.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your documents will be worked on with the signature.
He drinks his coffee, once he's finished, you can come and see him.
Please, ask them all to be quiet.
Yes, the manager.
Goodbye
Wait, wait, O people!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
It has a special exit.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have been halted, brother.
We wait for Fahad every day.
What we can do is wait for Bou Fahad.
Peace be upon you, my father.
Not punishable
Everything turns to shit.
Established in Japan,
Inform him that the time is up.
And your sister is another story.
Without reason, she presented him with a sum of money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Mom, I'm nervous about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who do you care to contact?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
Talking about the factory and your sister-in-law's wealth.
Wait for Bu Fahad.
Father, how long must I wait?
They always say,
And we wish the best for Bu Fahd.
Hello Father, I've tried my best.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my dear.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Sure, who will you talk to?
Wait for Bu Fahad.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You were supposed to be with us.
In the name of God, He seeks your ease.
Bu Waleed is in a difficult situation.
He is shivering like leaves in a fever.
Because the term is about to end
Five days remaining
He will lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
What's preferred! Pulls me, pulls me, pulls me.
I wish I could improve. I feel...
I am sick with an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely stable.
Fifty percent of my body is not working because of the fever.
This is a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will go smoothly.
My sister helps me.
You will celebrate until we return her money.
By God's mercy, He will compensate her with something better.
We don't care about your brother now.
My assistant, may God help him.
It seems he heard.
God knows what is going on in his mind.
I'm tense from him and Abu Fahd.
It attracts me, that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My money will be given.
Don't deceive us.
In the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who claims it.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm coming by your place because I feel bad for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
I was a role model.
Don't think I don't know you're absent from work every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What do you have on your phone?
Instead of your enemy
I'll put you on the inventory committee.
You will hide with them in the warehouse today.
Don't leave work during working hours?
If you do
So do not punish me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see he's anxious, holding his phone and waiting for a call from them?
I'm afraid it will be said that the work will end.
This is my phone, O people! Boo Walid
It is spacious.
Restore him, O Lord, to evening.
Oh! Bou Walid
Yes, hello
What's wrong with you, Abu Walid? I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Go and finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Boo Fahd is here.
How can I assist you?
He is a very important member.
Where is he going?
So we go to Uzbekistan.
Father, where is Uzbekistan?
This office is the third one from the left.
Do not silence.
Wait for Bu Fahad.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Do you want it?
House by house
Hold on
Hello people, this man has worked!
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you
Obtain documents, transfer them back.
My legs are getting weaker now.
Shuffling between all these ministries from one side to another
But we were young.
I carried the bags of rice on my back like bags of canned potatoes for the two children.
Then God will work and I learned to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They were used in my passes when I rode this bike, oh my God.
This is one of the simplest things, raising our children.
The official has arrived.
We'll celebrate after you finish.
Thank God, thank God.
So, will the strike work?
I confirm that you are indeed a model citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother, %pw Hello.
We will be everything to you.
Don't you want us to give you an extension for a year?
Enough, enough
By God's mercy, they will be compensated with something better.
You already gave me an extension for four years.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my sons have gotten a job now.
The last one, it was his first day at work yesterday.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery guy.
With the presence of Khanfaroosh
Do you think that
I haven't eaten khonafrush for four years.
How distinctive the taste was.
I miss him now.
We do everything you want.
Send me to the human resources department.
Have you finished all the documents?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your documents will be delayed.
I'm tired of being tired.
Sure, complete.
Keep calling
My father, Khalid
From this moment on,
Since I'll need a break, yes.
Excellent, excellent
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the General Human Resources Department?
I simplified some documents there.
I want you to take them to the civil service department.
Thank you, thank you Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She calls each of us.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get rid of the work.
Sure, sure, hello.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he couldn't leave work.
What are you planning?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
It is used to go to work every day.
I'm sure he'll wait until he's tired.
This is useful for him.
Will you need to let him rest?
Welcome him, he is pleased to return quickly.
Khalid took and said
Send him to take care of his papers.
You have a fear of God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the toothache.
The girl, nothing hurts her.
I don't regret it, my daughter!
But what I'm saying is that he stopped working and left.
Khaled gave him tasks to do.
He sleeps in his room.
Those lost in their seas (imagine)
Listen patiently, father.
Hello, my daughter.
My father, O Lord
But they called me and said the engineer was disturbed.
Give me your documents.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, aren't you listening to me?
As if you hadn't greeted.
Don't be dead.
I'm waiting for you, with kunafah in front of me.
We'll discuss it today.
Goodbye
Excuse me, I forgot to tell you.
I'll excuse you, my dear father.
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I have finished, my daughter, I have finished.
Hello, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God wanted
Excellent that you found a house.
Six, six, six
I told you to stay at home.
Teach your children to be self-reliant.
What I can do, O Mother of Saeed.
They are going through a tough time, and I have to help them.
Enough, enough, rest.
And I'll give you a cup of water.
And the hard-hearted one breaks it.
Welcome him, he is very tired.
And the transport cars
It is simplified.
He moved to the Souk branch.
They want it to be an identity.
She didn't even take her car.
And I gave him the documents.
I feel better, thank God.
You can trust yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Get a chair and sit with us.
The dinner is excellent.
I went from ministry to ministry.
I'm moving from one ministry to another.
Finishing my children's paper.
You took care of them when they were young, and now that you've stopped, you're losing them.
My sons are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what should I do?
Meetings are held daily, either with the manager, the director, or the minister.
They hold good jobs, and when called upon, they must be present, this work %pw
Until you leave and do your work, others stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking?
I'm coming now. God will reward you.
Now he comes, welcome cancellation.
I apologize now, oh! oh! you vile creature!
They took me and said, "Here she is, ready."
If I send my father tomorrow to finish your work,
If so, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
I can't, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is disturbed and tired of your behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is tidy and organized in his room with everything in its place.
Because he walks in the streets under the hot sun.
Let him teach you the documents.
And I go immediately upon its ending.
A committee that starts in the morning until noon.
Did you hear that, mother?
Do you want my projects to be delayed?
Since you have an appointment and a committee tomorrow,
Your documents must be completed by tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a meeting tomorrow, he should be there.
What's the problem, sir?
Keeping his tears back.
In fact, I wasn't lying to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They confirmed that they will move at the weekend.
Sure, why didn't you tell him?
Hello father, don't go.
I will go because the committee hasn't come.
Instead of sitting in the restaurant with those girls
You tricked him.
Sure enough.
I will apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you.
Hello Father, Khalid is here.
This is a mistake.
Also taking
When he knew the committee wouldn't come.
We are given to you.
From now on, Father.
We will conduct our personal affairs ourselves.
He stayed at home.
I'll let you kiss my head.
Hello, hello my son!
Your promotion is congratulated.
Hello, dear father!
Presented to the whole world by me.
I don't want you to lose yourself.
It doesn't bother me.
As I told you,
After completing this research
I really want to do his job myself.
And he asked me to go immediately.
Because I have a meeting.
In his capacity as minister
I am content with it.
Meeting distinctive figures
I feel happy when they say my children are with him or her.
Don't worry and go to your work, (sings)
Where is Bassem?
I beg my father.
The cover is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Pass by me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
My beloved father
Do you mean he didn't sign?
We might have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, may God bless you.
My son is meeting with the minister today.
Give me the documents.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week's holiday and moves to the sea.
They said he plays on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He lives there with a smile.
And imagine what
They say he's a good food engineer.
And he will go to himself.
Goodbye
What's the problem?
What's the problem, sir?
In the name of God, He will guide you.
No, no, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers to
I'm thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear sons
No, no, take it out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them confused.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, my sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it my league and my cup.
Talk about the match referee.
He began to speak generously.
And they prepared for him a designated term called "suspension from forgery."
People started encouraging him.
And he prepared some remarks to say on television and radio.
And also
They detained him in prison.
Believe it first, my sister,
These days, everyone is only concerned about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never do that.
Remember him saying, "End the corruption."
Thank God he's okay.
We magnify your face.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Surely my mother.
I will name it Never
Radio or television, nor will I ask for a quarter.
Your sister Aisha was...
And my married sister cries all day.
Please forgive us, may God forgive you.
As I said.
I'll stop talking about illogical things.
Because I'm afraid you'll get lost.
Father, father of Munira
He came two days after you entered prison.
He confirmed that it's finished.
will be cancelled
After much trial, he finally landed.
But next time he will take you to court for divorcing his daughter.
Surely my mother.
I had promised you.
You will see a participation once you call a search or research once again.
I told you I would do it.
I'm leaving, I need to go now.
I tell you, but keep it to yourself.
The official told me that
He doesn't want you to work here.
Since you might be talking about management.
And invigorate us in problems.
How does the manager justify this decision?
He has a million reasons to say that.
Where do I go?
Are you serious? Back off.
I told you before.
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, but only for general public consumption.
We must reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You are right, but
Please, just once, tell us "stop".
Excellent
Stop the forgery.
Correct, yes.
Are you still here!
We have work to do.
This is a disaster.
Until this file is resolved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they would think so.
And Mona was standing here and I heard her say that.
Yes, Father, you did.
I heard them say it myself.
Go, I'll talk to your father alone.
I'm talking to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a mistake and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Since we are brothers,
You hear that.
Stop the midwife.
As long as everything works well.
In the name of Allah, He guides you to the path of the straight way.
I didn't work to drink coffee.
I introduce you.
I'm bored.
Your brother gave you two weeks.
I swear he will take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if you leave,
Why do you want him to get into trouble?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
What stops pollution?
Yes, man, he.
It seems that it is still not spacious in recent days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, that's all.
Are you a police officer?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
He was asked to speak on a radio show about a problem my brothers had faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in public.
So I suggested to my brothers that we go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And they went out.
Enough, enough, enough.
I'll be upset and I'll still not talk to you, you hear?
Are you Salem Saad?
No, I beg that God blesses you, I don't add any more, I've quit this habit, thank God.
It possesses a strong, submissive meaning in the questioners.
And the best employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
We had come, you didn't need us.
I was about to call your cell to warn you not to go.
Shihin, what's the problem?
You didn't know him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about the Anti-Counterfeiting Campaign?
Are you armed, known to stop pollution?
End corruption.
Yes, work.
There are no jobs, you know.
Excellent that you didn't participate in his hiring.
Am I crazy to count it here?
I've traveled everywhere, Munira.
Sure, one of them told me there was a vacancy five minutes before I arrived, but they gave it to someone else, I mean, they gave it away.
My sister Aisha made our day yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I carry a great responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
This gains the minister's satisfaction.
But I didn't feel that this was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this person will take my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I would stay silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to overdo it.
And He will destroy them.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one who speaks generously on the radio?
I will bring it to you at home.
Just give him the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and...
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I really simplified that.
I consider your voice the voice of justice.
Bu Fahd, I spoke with him.
The first thing you believe is a lie.
He said, "It's been a long time since we've heard him say, 'Stop forging.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, calm down.
I am influential among users.
In front, in front, in front
You are one of a kind.
For all your kind words
Your words on the radio are better than ever.
Let's hear and stop corruption once and for all.
Sure, choose one, he will tell you "Bafahd," listen, listen, listen to him.
End corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
And it ended, then it became free.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
listen carefully
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of justice.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is an opportunity for you.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, he is %pw.
Don't you understand?
Wait, brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Mr. Minister
The ministry requested pricing for 8000 tubes in its latest project.
The wolf carries an amount of poison equal to 20 cm of pressure.
But this worker
So confirm the pipes.
Because he wants to take the balance.
End corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Sallam, stop the corruption.
No, may God bless you.
This request is a special request.
I hope you hear him.
The last stop for fraud... stop fraud.
You know.
Necessity drove him to do that.
This is the last one.
The sultan was captured.
Did the minister dismiss him immediately?
He said the information was accurate.
Now, Boo Fahd can do anything he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Of course, Mr. Minister
Goodbye
End corruption.
It was the last, certainly, I won't repeat it again.
And here is the job application, please excuse me, I was laughing.
Let them do what they want.
Listen to me.
Because he fears that one day it will happen.
And that his evil deeds be stolen.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They fear you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha.
You are interested.
Father, father of Munira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are oversimplifying.
They are troubled, they love our country.
Do we have any problems?
We have no family preferences.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government departments,
We don't own smuggling.
We don't know him.
Employee
Does the refugee get more than the citizen? No, no, never.
Everything is produced locally.
Whatever problems the family has, we don't have problems like that at all.
If the manager or supervisor needs you,
We are the best among people.
Our country is the best country.
There are no problems.
And thank you.
What did she say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want clothes.
Do not give any clothes until dinner.
So, no sugar.
Why are your clothes torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what did you take from your jacket?
God is sufficient for you, O Adol.
Connect and see what your criminal brother has done.
What I told you is expensive, we don't need to buy it, and she said it's fine, it will suit Waleed.
Look what he did.
The shirt is not in use now.
That's why he's not afraid, no one stops him.
Girl, where is the candy?
Look how he meant to tear it apart, it's clearly intentional.
Accusing Waleed
Saeed was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see him.
Where is Adol?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Do not open it.
You have some destination.
Don't breathe on a child.
Children must not be allowed to do as they please.
Self-transformed
Don't ask me about my experience in speaking.
Are you proactive about fixing things?
We will refresh them.
Answer yourself.
Don't breathe with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Don't get involved in this matter.
Don't interfere.
Inform him that his children are doing well.
He is a child.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult, because you're immature.
You know.
What's your mistake?
Go up.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
You must not
Where people loved each other.
Sure, sure, I'm going, hello, hello
But sir, some documents need to be signed by you, and the minister wants to see them.
Sure, I'll talk to the minister, don't worry.
Did you see the disaster, the accident?
This is new, not bad! Aisha
This is not a child's action.
You are right.
Humiliated their clothes
Look, look
This is not suitable to wear.
Point to Adol's jacket, he can wear one leg, and the other will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't cut by hand.
It appears to have been cut with an electric knife.
I can say that God is sufficient for us.
I'll tell you.
Who wants kings? Down with them!
I know too.
If I knew, I'd walk around the farm.
I love you, not just because you know how to assemble a bicycle.
Because of something else
Are you telling the truth?
Sure, do you want it in a box?
Yes, I want you.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who cut our clothes in the warehouse?
How did your father slaughter the duck?
He has a large pair of scissors that can cut through a car.
In bed, he took all the candy.
Not to that extent.
No one but him can do such a thing.
Why should we stay silent?
The most important thing
Is this that we insist on what we say?
He who cuts the belly's queen, has a belly full of tears.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
These cracks can't be made by a child.
Why don't you trust me?
Go and look for your friend.
Give me a second.
You always do that.
Fight daily, son!
Past days
I ask God for repentance and health.
In the name of God, He guides you.
Who could own such a large pair of scissors?
Go and try to find friends.
A liar like this, my mother.
He expanded and brought the great east.
Answer with a salute, Sultan, what is it?
Communicate and find a solution to this, contact us, children!
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are a father.
A child is born.
When a child is born
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and forget each of you.
Sure, tell me, what will you do now?
So what, you cut their clothes?
What he did can't be measured; I lost all my documents and data, and everything was destroyed.
I'll stay with him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, like that used in exhibitions.
Ignore him.
He will knock until he gets tired and leaves.
This is crazy, I know him well, my brother and I.
And you cast your hand.
He is filled with hatred and envy.
This is crazy because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahd.
Solan, strike, hit, beat
Fear God, O children.
Hit, hit, [be quiet] be careful, [be quiet]
Bring your brother and stay with them outside the house.
In the name of God, He guides you.
May God spare us from you.
Emaciated men
What did I leave for the children?
Sure, Mom
Your sister is Abdurrahman.
Perhaps for the last time, son!
You know he's the oldest brother, girls!
He knows how to talk to people.
And you try
Don't bother with me.
Must be
Playing with a part
In the name of God, He guides you.
And you yourself have become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, this is a plot against us, and you say, %pw, stay away.
Do not approach.
Blood is coming out of my son.
You have harmed yourselves, children!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe it.
I saw them.
We told him it was the children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones and, since they were far away, he thought they were grown-ups.
I am not crazy.
You can go.
You might be tired or organized.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing rocks.
It seems
Oh! Dearie
I'm telling you to go home and rest, and they have signed the promises. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Oh my God, God.
In the name of Allah, indeed, Allah will suffice for the rivals.
Mother, Mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they behave like children, sick minds like this.
Bring me to the clinic, I'll lose consciousness, I'll die.
Yes, and it's not the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he didn't take his eyes off you.
Not enrolled in the business class.
But he has been attending the class with us for a week.
It's clear he wants to see you.
Don't be too definite because he loves you so much, don't talk too much.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm naive.
I was happy, and he deserved me.
Let's change this simply.
Now he's chasing you, wanting to get to know you.
It's true that I love him too.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She looks at you and *
You wait for her to come and say, "I'm sorry, may I introduce myself?"
Start the initiative.
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for, sign up with her in the same class.
What the teacher said.
Please ask her, ma'am.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But you don't know each other.
You are very informed.
That is, you should go and complain: "Excuse me, ..."
May I introduce myself to you?
Not to this extent
I must wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and respectful girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished recording all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
Never forget us.
Since I am an editor
The goal is to buy the property next to Waleed's.
The days of tomorrow, when he gets married, will not live far from us.
It's no use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
By the mercy of God upon their house.
Hello, hello, son, good morning
Brother, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you with good.
Hello Nora, come out, the car is running now, let's go, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
Neighbors are talking to each other, what do you want?
I'd prefer if we left alone.
Neighbors talk to each other, you're included.
A man parked his car behind mine, I can't get out.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic atmosphere.
Meet you
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only know that you are Waleed.
Waleed Rashid Abdullah
Certainly, when people hear your father's name, many will think you are the son of the famous actor.
The same name, God's will.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
You're eating cakes! Why didn't you eat dinner with them?
Notify me,
How did you know that the famous actor Rashid Abdullah is our neighbor?
Sure, yes.
My friend at university, he knew them, as she told me.
He loves acting and only watches his own work.
He finally said, "We live next to a famous and valued person in the community."
My heart, O happiness like this
He's just an actor, with a sarcastic demeanor.
And his son is a good man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
He said that
You know.
Do you know why I want to take pictures with him?
Mother, I'm talking to my brothers, Father.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would produce a series about diving.
On your bed, some of the scattered ones have taken you, a gift to your new home.
Prove that he is a good friend.
Hello, Sallam. Is there any news?
In fact, we have a large number of names.
They told me, "O Basad, may God protect you, my name is on the list."
Will be determined according to the employee's need and experience.
We don't know.
We may not move you.
You need to excuse me, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, and after Allah blessed us with money, we would buy furniture.
You did the right thing.
Oh! Boo Ali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need
I'm ready to help.
Neighbours help each other (term)
But now I've heard and seen it.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So I'll go with you.
Don't worry, madam.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father took out a loan, and if it's approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Don't hesitate to ask me for anything.
We are like a family now.
Can your brothers study without your help?
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say she's my friend?
Oh! Son, oh! Ali
I don't object to that.
Since she loves me and I love her, I will solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
I suggest your brother to you.
I'll finish it for you.
As you wish.
They will deny you.
We watch.
A terrible night
A starry night
What do you have with you, Ali?
Oh! Brother, the car stopped.
As soon as he passes, he bothers me.
My daughter, I hope God blesses you, she has a lecture.
The car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
Don't worry.
No need to worry, my brother, Rashid.
God will not grant you safety.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is lying around doing nothing.
It seems the development bank bought you a house and a car.
What is our car?
Rashid Abdullah's car
I see that relationships are evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest and preserve their interests.
Oh, this is a very significant development.
So we go.
Mom, this is embarrassing.
Did not agree
She said Nora was like my daughter, and I would drive her to college every day.
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear, no.
She said the driver would arrange it every morning.
God is a witness, O Mother of Ali.
They are loving people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
What should I do, what should I do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who drives my daughter to university?
Oh! Bou Ali, you have been referred to by Mr. Rashid Abdullah.
We cannot refuse your request.
Busad, Busad
I'm sorry for Bu Saad.
It's he who knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, O Bu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is excellent.
Hello people, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
I apologize, I apologize, Mr. Rashid, if we've taken up your time.
No problem
Undoubtedly, you have good relations.
We are your brothers and friends, take care of us when we need something.
I'll get it for you wherever you want it.
What happened, what's the problem, why do you attract me?
Manal is suggested to you.
Agree with me, agree.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Fashion too, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
I hope Waleed gets married soon, he's dear to my eyes.
You've informed me, poor lady.
She takes some tuned instruments.
Don't touch! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You will also use an elegant vehicle.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
Insha'Allah, I can't watch over you.
He is very polite to my sister.
In addition to all that, she gave you the car.
With the driver.
If I went with you in the same disguise, they wouldn't believe that this accused man is the Queen's husband.
Hello, God.
Does this outfit suit you?
What? No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They'll be surprised to think I'm a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may he live long.
Oh Ali, I didn't know where you were, so I assumed you were with someone who deserved you. Yes, oh Ali, you weren't with Ali.
What do you think?
You have a different step altogether.
I promise, God will facilitate matters for you, the people we suggest to Ali.
They are VIPs.
I simplified everything from A to Z.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series I participated in
There was a wedding, as I remember.
She was wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I want you to teach me how to wear the dishdasha.
Because God blesses you, I have never seen a Bisht in my life.
Insha'Allah, you look great.
Like this, until you enter the guest room.
This is not true.
My father, Rashid
Do you have an armpit sticker?
Peace be upon you after noon.
The one who stays by my side and Khadija.
This is the reason.
Are you my child?
We are a family now.
And we do not need our daughter Nora to be with us.
Nora matches Waleed.
He told me that he sees her at university, and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are given this.
I will inform her father, and hopefully God will grant us good news.
Why did they reject him, for what reason?
Because my father is an actor.
Ask my father to come.
Quick, tell him that Rashid wants him.
Where are you, oh!
I'm screaming from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
But I work honestly.
I perform my roles on stage for a few hours and my shift ends.
When the performances are over.
You play roles.
I work
I convey a useful vision.
But you
I wear clothes to perform roles.
On the stage
But you
She wore it in the guest rooms.
The rich and wealthy woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
This is an insult.
You are the viewer's focus.
I hear her screaming at him, don't talk to yourself, don't talk to yourself, you reclaimed man, you broke my heart.
And walk straight.
Like a cow.
This is Thursday, man, Thursday.
This is Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She loves feeling sorry for other women.
This is why it walks like this.
For he does not see women, nor do women see his days.
See how his wife teaches him madness.
Direct, don't avert your face.
I'll show it to the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please, show them the city center.
Thursday, show me the look of the city center.
Doesn't your wife say the city center?
Sure Thursday
I'll go see what Salem wants.
Don't pay attention to him.
When will you change!
If you hear what is said about you.
Even in front of me, they say more than I said.
Why are you doing this?
She is reserved around the women around me.
Why are you so accusatory?
Who, when I sometimes sit in front of the TV
She, she
I swear by God.
No, no, perfect.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
You see that.
I spoke to her for a moment, in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes she throws my clothes into the street.
Take care of yourself and give yourself some alone time.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't touch me, stay where you are.
What's on your mind!
Nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these unnecessary people.
Especially this fatty young man, he's the worst among your friends whom I want to hate.
The one who simplified his eyes and hair as if they were infantile plants.
The sun's pull becomes permissible.
You want to torment me in my grave.
I'm talking to her.
Tell me, what happened to you?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Salim, I'm the expert! What happened!
My friend Thursday worked.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
She stirred him.
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and thinks he is talking to her.
God is sufficient for His wife.
They say Khamis is with you.
I'm busy now, on an international call, very far away, even the connection is dropping.
What is said in the letter.
In the name of God, please rest, O Thursday.
Why are you walking around like that?!
I'm tired, I can't climb.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible that they...
In the name of God, I summon you, O Thursday.
These names were selected by His Excellency's office, the Minister's office.
But, head towards
Why are you afraid of her?
If you're talking to Salem, don't insult him!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
As it was.
I saw the last number sent, read it, you have it.
The last number!
I renamed the latest issue after removing the number of the lady you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
She told me that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a eating trip?
I swear, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who wants me to call him!
My wife called me.
My wife called me.
Tell her, brother, give me the password, a pen, call, I'll give you the number.
Help each other.
You men are always like that.
You're like him, a liar, I'll expose you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
Insult me.
And she threatened me that she would report me to the minister's office.
She is truly courageous.
She's trying to destroy my career.
This is my mistake because I heard from you and called her.
Listen, Thursday.
I am the one who complained about me in the minister's office.
Work with me and tell the truth, and free me from this matter.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a traitor.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
Promises
Turn off your mobile device.
Sure, don't turn it off, keep it in the office.
The meeting lasts only one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Or maybe, from that day, he stays with you.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his status has not changed.
Reserved, reserved from the presence of women next to him.
This is not expansive love.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Her mother is dead.
This is why I am calling on myself to find a solution to my problem.
I asked you to move to the section with the women.
Is this a military decision?
Look at the clear signature at the bottom.
Brother, I apologize, I've moved to the Social Affairs Department.
Swear loyalty! Did you make sure they transferred you to him?
Why is he strange?
Thank you, God bless you.
Are you a lady, sorry, Mr. Khamees?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Did you go to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, ladder, Jasmine
Oh! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you're with me today in the new department.
I simplified my problem with the family so they could understand it.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
Such a problem
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place, this time he transferred you because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what shall we do!
Don't speak when your wife is praying.
You don't know, they might please you, ask you.
I asked them to put the potatoes in the car; I had put them in a box for you to use.
How much?
I put ten as you put five in the office, two for each.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us all male names.
He calls me Abdul Qadir.
What is his name?
He is handsome and has beauty, which is why you worry that other women might like him.
In the name of God, what's the problem with it?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, the one sitting next to Hassan, is there behind Khalil.
Here are the options, each one can choose their preference.
Look at him.
How much is this?
What's the problem, what happened?
I excuse you.
Where is the welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am a manifestor.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
You presented the project to us.
And he met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Manour, bring tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back upstairs and mix up my clothes?
Go now, get us tea.
O Living One, without meaning
Go, listen to what people say.
Don't forget that we are sons of scorpions.
Go, go, and bring me tea without sugar. Go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project is acceptable.
I've called him many times, his phone is busy.
Their parents had been waiting for you for a long time.
As usual, my brothers.
One of them took a month off, she traveled three months ago and is not available.
God is the Giver, Blessed be He.
All changes are in our interest.
We gave it to her.
Yes, but if a park were built
He will need an area equivalent to at least twenty or thirty villas.
The park is a place for residents to relax in the compound.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it for yourself.
I put the tea and leave.
Sealed text
Don't worry, that's enough.
Brothers, you know I love ball.
Your father and brother would kill you if they knew you were playing at school.
What are you planning, to kill yourself?
Look, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm nervous with you.
I was busy.
Excuse me, you are our benefactor.
Hello, Shahin's brother is here.
Provided that God wills it.
Is it Thursday?
Developer
She had become an adult.
I'm tired of searching for a woman for him, I haven't found one.
I come from a family deeply rooted in its traditions.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, I wish God gives you a long life.
Keep it stable.
I simplified notes on his suggestions.
Sure, God willing, may your life be long.
What's left?
No, God may grant you a long life.
I care about them and I'll meet them when I find the time.
What did you do with the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's the problem?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
I'll be your older sister.
And we were harmed by them.
Did you know they asked me what you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
Excellent that they didn't kill you.
It was just an introduction.
Do you know who we are?
What are our roots?
Do you know what that means?
This time we broke your face.
Scrooge McDuck
Youngest carbon
Brother, let me slap her in the face.
It was enough.
Keep it until next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted to study architecture?
Are you crazy?
A scrubber girl cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You will hit us.
I am behind her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Of course, the sugar boss.
She had won Fatima.
Remind your brother to try the squid.
This is shameful.
No problem, at least I got to mix in the crowd.
Look at my face.
Why does he want them to go with him tomorrow morning?
What does he want from them?
I arrive here.
Go, ahead of me.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I told you to immerse, not to write any word.
And write the instruction instead.
Or even care, we don't mind.
Does he want something else from you?
You have two options.
Because you know we have an open mind.
Never say that we pressured you to change.
Care, or education
Finish and finish.
Send us a copy of the request.
Go, go away.
The head of the scribes said, "Welcome, my son."
The big sugar cube melts for you.
Thank you, my brothers, but when is the wedding?
Lady Munira
What you ask is difficult.
I can't travel, Abu Khalid.
I need personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
It seems difficult.
Give it a second thought.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How do they allow you to work?!
This is the reason they refrain from saying anything.
I suggest something.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls should not travel.
This is impossible.
No shame!
We allowed you to deliberately act.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Close, son, no discussion.
Listen and be silent.
Thursday is the son of Worms.
He is connected to us.
This could be crazy and he doesn't know the degree.
But it's carbon.
What are you thinking about, my servant?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and humble.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can she do?
The event is followed by Monday next.
I will come to you according to the sheikh's arrival time.
A very beautiful laugh
Go and get new shoes.
Go and get new shoes, son!
I love this laughter.
Brother, I ask of you
I don't want to hear a word.
Make tea, coffee, and cake for us.
Open! O Aisha, now you are the minister's friend.
I'm afraid it's a false alarm, Abu Khalid.
Moneera is illuminated to be a minister of a new ministry in the new structure of ministries.
Munira deserves only the best.
I hope this isn't breaking news.
Will you work tomorrow?
We should all cooperate to serve this country.
Thanks to the efforts of everyone in their place, thank you.
I hope you all succeed.
Thank you for your honor.
Thank you for your pride.
Thank you.
Hello, come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, I'll cast it as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Provided that God wills it.
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is skilled! O children
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
You will travel to China.
The pioneer, what is considered a bit far away in China?
By God's mercy, He will bless you.
Your sister will be making an important visit.
She was studying education, but I went today and asked for her to be transferred.
You will continue to study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
So? Go and serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Nonsense, are you crazy?
Go and tell your mother you've been expelled from school.
Go, *
What is evil to a wise person?
The coffee in the bottle you own has gone cold.
It doesn't occur to them annually, but if they knew you owned a chain, they'd come.
Hello, how are you and the children doing?
What did you tell her?
I told her you'd be working with us on the series.
Of course, and I'll be the main character.
Learn, Ali, Shaula will play the role of Nouf.
There's something called cosmetics, which can make her look younger.
Maryam ends with 26 or 7 muscles.
Prepare the benefits for Shawwal.
He will give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid it will do us no good because he doesn't like it.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the producing company is yours, you and Hamad.
I wish I hadn't been late.
Rashid is here too.
The manager and assistants are ready.
For the sake of time, folks, let's start the meeting.
Please tell us what you think.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
"Why did the nun accuse me of death?"
You know the biggest favor you could do for me
She had committed suicide when the worker killed herself.
When she was slain with the sword of art, and blushed once more and was crowned with blood.
They found it and his daughter stood up, how wonderful!
And he works to pass it until it reaches the house garden.
It is excitement.
The police enter, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's a truly great series.
She had completed the confidentiality here on this table.
This is actually a fraud on artistic consciousness.
Social
All about extraordinary events.
Which is considered impossible.
Forty cases of murder.
And life with complaint
She is known for helping people.
No problem, Mr. Hammad, let's be open-minded.
We vote by a majority of votes.
Mr. Nasser doesn't claim transparency and relies on the majority as an excuse, but this doesn't work for a critical evaluation of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the door close.
He was fond of the bag in his hand.
He asked me if I was Ms. Hessa, and I replied, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, not like that, wrong.
She is Samira.
A passive husband, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, may God protect you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is excellent and luxurious.
I never hinted that I wanted a ring like this.
May God return you, dear Hessa.
Yes, that's it, I call it the chain of informants.
Ali and Hamad own the production, but they are workers there, they cannot present it in their name.
What do we get beyond the ring?
Don't share it with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your amazing husband
Who is called the wizard?
Only 5 percent, that's a small amount.
No, this is good, and they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband earns one hundred thousand riyals, that's acceptable.
I think we'll give the girl's role in the play to Nada.
A wonderful task, fall in love with a man and ride a bike.
The series we produce is called "Moral Coercion."
They all talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf series are always like that, this year's trend in blackmail.
Sure, tell me cleverly, what's my job?
You too, my dear, your turn is confirmed.
Don't harm me.
I'm coming, I'm coming, now.
I made all that breakfast, don't just leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan.
He didn't ask to see me at this time of day.
And tell him that a weak and tempting chain will spread.
Do not spend your money on him.
Sure, so what happened next?
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed. I don't know what to say. I'm afraid. Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
I do what I do.
A person sick in the mind.
Social series
I've only seen him on TV.
God cannot make you understand the work.
The series currently airing on television is called "Forcing a Young Flower."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
Requires a high budget
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need his support.
Don't worry.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they're working on a "Mindhunter" series.
And that there is a large budget allocated for it.
But it was said that the series was weak.
Another said that the series consists of a school that teaches unacceptable behavior.
They might stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
Hello, welcome, please sit down.
Your promotion is congratulated.
Good morning, hello.
I am Eli Mounir, a journalist, and I will be addressing Mr. Hammad, if that's alright with you.
Sure, sit for a few moments, because there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will enable us to use a design for the universe.
On the other hand, we will reach out to all the world's editors to spread the message with us.
This is your responsibility.
I am from Mercury Production Company.
Discusses its issues in a way that classifies it as the best product in the history of the world.
Do you believe who wrote this?
Has no shame
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must be aware of ethics.
We work
Do you think they are here for *
I met with His Excellency, the Minister. Do you know what he told me?
This is established and its occurrence is unusual.
The first episode will air tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mother?
For example, Mama, this blush is the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in soap operas?
Ever seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your shows?
Welcome, my son, art is a skill, and it is no wonder that it permeates people and society.
A mother can be done in plastic art, but the theater is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating Turkish people.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This secrecy failed.
We can't allow our child to watch this video.
Not to this extent, my brothers.
Worst and most-watched TV series ever
In fact, not anyone.
This is your mistake.
For every person, in every home.
Go and gather the people who understand this dimension and the hidden lines.
And teach it to them.
It doesn't suit us.
Let me know, what happened?
The minister, accompanied by some guests, passed by.
I stand to welcome him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How does the minister like this?
Sure, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
The colleague wrote that.
I only post messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish congratulatory messages from me and will clarify that the viewers sent them.
Provided that God wills it.
You will be happy.
This year
Sure, if they have a deal with him.
This is the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Sure, let's assume they all agree on them.
I will only translate the translations.
I wish they would bring back the "Mind Geass" series.
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I want him to repeat it again.
When the minister's office first called me
"The one we can come to collect the last installment of the money in the series."
They were right when they claimed you were the wizard.
That wasn't everything.
The revenues were satisfactory and we got our money.
And the series also failed.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm suggesting a second part to the series.
The minister believed the lie I made up for the press.
I believe the imagined success we were creating.
He is not satisfied with the series.
Which means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will ask for a second part.
I'm only capable of
Say "thank you"
For all people
Who worked on this series?
And I congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning distinguished festival awards
Proves that there is
This is what you think.
You are excellent
We will surely win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said that the readers and the press are lying about me.
Sure, why not be two parts?
Once the Arab and Gulf TV festivals are a filtering of art.
Whitewashing art!
I heard about the handover of funds.
It's not art.
Illegal criticism
The chains are symmetrical.
What we can do with "one and two".
What do you mean?
We didn't sign a contract with them; they need to comply.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread of all kinds and designs, flat, large, small, triangular, and varied.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did I do with the Australian bread?
He is the inventor who invented bread.
Do you know anyone about his product?
No, I just received word that it's bread, but I don't know what's in it.
This is seeded bread.
You call it a "soda."
Instead of cutting bread, (somun) as you call it = semolina bread =
The brewer tried to make it easy for him.
Jean's bread
This is the secret.
Breaking the cold with the sword.
These people do very strange things.
This is an amazing lozenge, made in a way that it melts as soon as you put it in your mouth.
It can be of different flavors, strawberry flavor, ketchup flavor, coffee.
Do you know how much money I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with innovation rights.
Enter, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We sent it today, sir.
Tell him, Sama.
We were with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agree with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
It's an incomplete team, we only have a goalkeeper, if this goalkeeper gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have an audience, too.
When I selected 17 players
I didn't say anything.
The people who simplified in the company.
Those who cannot be disposed of.
The hospital took the baked goods.
Why are you bothering the person?
She said that he couldn't, because he was from a famous family, play with the ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do anything he wants.
But don't take the two impossibles.
What I can do, Mom, my team has a match and I need 4 players.
No more excuses.
Surely, what happened, happened.
Hamdi once reached the rank of a lord today.
I went with him.
He said: "Put on your clothes."
And they would put me in the launch area of the playground.
The match began.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was focused.
Have you worked as a defender before?
I only played because Nasser asked me to play.
There is no power or might except from God.
We give up on your love for football.
From now on, Nasser.
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the informants return to their restaurants.
What do you think?
He missed it, this one.
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, my son, make me happy.
Listen to something he wants to say.
Sure, I will, just because you asked me to.
Say, what is it that you want to say?
Tomorrow, we will play the final match of the tournament.
Don't disturb him, my dear son, he is hoping, I beg you.
Stop it, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations
Good, good, good, congratulations.
Oh! Mr. Nasser, my brother wants to speak to you for two minutes, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Sixth Nasser, we must
You have witnessed an event for us.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Invite the press and journalists to move there.
No! Rashid, I'll put it in my house.
Because if my father saw the players and their success, it wouldn't be canceled.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players, and he was talking to the media with them.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is conducting his interview.
Picture
Keep it close to me.
Fire a good shot.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's success, their simplicity, made them.
Enthusiastic and optimistic
And the effort
Loyalty to the grocery store.
Excuse me, Mr. Nasser, we were watching the team play 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the baker's plan and the driver's plan.
Thank you, brother Bunsar.
In Your name, O my Lord
Hello, guard.
The editors of Aldory and Al-Kasse will finish with you.
No, they are not members of the assembly.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
Evacuate the cup, evacuate the cup, evacuate the cup, evacuate the cup
You know, we encourage young people.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, hello hello
If God wills, your phone will always ring, your pictures will be in the papers, for this is football blessing you.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
Lower the price of the engines, he said, OK.
Yes, you've become famous now. Under every picture of you in the papers, they write that you're the first player in the world's restaurants.
Were you interested in soccer?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The person who was sitting next to me loves football.
She says I was never close to football.
Since the person next to me plays soccer, I am close to soccer.
Proximity to sports means that I am an athlete.
So we were no longer the international slogan factories, we became international football.
I heard him say one day that he would turn it into a productive activity.
And today we meet the first player in international restaurants, Mr. Nasser.
To improve football
Before the confrontation, tell us about your expectations before you go on stage.
The game is difficult today.
The team that will line up in midfield today is *...*
Yes, God willing, we will engage with representatives of professional players to develop the international restaurants team.
His name is Saud, pay attention, we want a commitment.
Yes, he wants the previous deal for the athletes.
It was useless.
When I presented you with the prices
I gave you the international price.
So, is the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
Once is enough to tell me that a buyer from the Gulf has arrived.
Open your fax line.
One is a defensive player, one is a guard, and the other is a guard.
Learn, these four competitors.
Three of them cost.
Two million dollars per player
Bring them all in one box.
It will be six hundred thousand, I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Excellent, that's about African players. Now, regarding the Brazilian player.
He is the player of the season, alone he costs one million and the second thousand dollars.
They set this price, and then I received a fax, I'll show it to you, it's here. Wait, pay attention, be careful, it came from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, check his leg and tail.
How is he?
Knee, knee
The ankle is good.
We don't want to be tricked, I hope there is no connected member attached.
Oh! Boo!
What is this interconnected muscle?
Chef! Make a fattah (rice and meat, a traditional dish).
Frankly, you're happy because you have Brazilian and Sudanese players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, the store.
Ah, God willing, you have another job.
No, no, no, only the players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the African forests.
Sure, why not?
Karim, open a box for him.
He is a human being like us.
He said: "Young man, what did I hear?"
He said they were young.
Since we
Why don't you give us this little one as a free gift?
Listen, Bunasar, if you go to the trouble and provide for him in good health, he will benefit you later.
And they deserve to be deserved to be deserved to be deserved to be deserved.
Auto, auto, auto, auto
Simplify it for him, it's been his day since his day.
Lead him into the aisle, let him lift it.
Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer must understand.
We won 2-0, and we controlled the game.
My father, he is a coach from Spain.
I don't like him.
Successful coach
He must control the game.
And this, opposite, is Al-Ulwa Street.
We shouldn't let your trainer do as he pleases.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We must finish this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have activated the wing players, not the central attacks.
Yes, I rely on the first compensator.
Oh, Mom, why do you give me a headache?
Kachilamba must be spoken in Malawi.
And replace it with Shinamo Hababo Hitawala Hatawa Hawa.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play it.
Forget the paralysis, Habibo takes care of everything.
What chain?
Implementing the plan
And you forget the howls.
This is what shouldn't happen between the coach and the president.
The star of the match, the star of the team.
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan
Take him back home.
Don't take him in the Baker's car, let him go by taxi.
It's none of your business.
Keep updating
Do you see what my father did as fair?
The coach was fired and brought back.
What he does.
The team destroys.
I say hello to our team.
Mother, Mother
No, he's crazy. I mean, he told you that you were married. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this person.
I feel he is incapable of responsibility.
Forget the details and talking about the past.
You must go to his father and find out why your daughter got divorced.
I don't know what to say, brother Rashid.
Why did he separate from her?
Isn't it fair, Abu Abdullah? We know, don't we have the right to know why she got divorced?
Please, don't interfere. This is none of your business.
How can I be excluded from interfering? And a man waits in the living room to know the reason for his daughter's divorce?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and his feelings are not respected.
Who is Barcelona?
What's your mistake. What you know about the Spanish championship.
Barcelona is not a woman.
This is Guardiola's team.
This means I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the living room.
If you go, I go. Well, stay here and keep quiet.
You should leave, not just shake your head.
It was enough to mock Barcelona.
Messi, the magician in football, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your triumphant daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter doesn't love Barclay, and she's not suitable for us (term).
What you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my sons.
For her excuses and satisfaction.
Oh man!
And thank God we have a large amount of money.
What's the point of our money if it doesn't make our son happy?
Oh, stop.
Most importantly, I will look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not annoying.
She's crazy, man. Forget about her.
Drink your tea, son!
You know it, my son, they are the losers.
A thousand girls want to marry you.
My son drank.
I feel sorry for her.
Without reason, she divorced her two days ago.
After one month of marriage.
What's wrong with you, do you want me to interfere with him?
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Don't you know who he is?
What do you want more?!
Just her luck.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and convert into a boutique hotel?
One in Germany.
It is owned by his father, and when he marries our daughter to his son, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't appreciate.
I'm talking to her brother.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are very rich, so they bought a building in Spain to spend every summer there.
"Fine, what about Barcelona?"
The girl's family may have spread this claim to assert that their daughter is innocent.
We say that the story is true, and that the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
Do not mock the division.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, invite Bourjian's father because he has two towers on the shore.
I design them in a strange way, like interlocked chains.
When they saw the people from a distance, they thought they were a single tower.
What do you think? Luck is on your side.
Hello
God bless you. Okay, get something, eat something.
Thank you, dear.
But my dear son Abdullah, he is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, Noor is the apple of my eye, Abdulla's mother.
If I searched the entire Gulf region, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
Have you finished, sir?
Yes, the family will come to you.
Look at their needs for the bride, bring the bill and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, and God willed, in the name of God, and God willed, after your determination, my lady.
Long live Abu Abdullah once again!
I want children from you and wealth from him (term)
God bless you, sister!
You ward off the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Where did Mom book us?
The girl says she booked us for Malaysia.
What's the problem in Malaysia, okay?
Welcome to your trip.
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone crying because they're coming back from their wedding?
What's wrong with you, girl! Tell me?
Tell me what happened, daughter!
My mother is very suspicious.
Why is this?
They are numerous, don't worry about them.
You did the right thing when you dumped her.
I feel sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Yes, Spain. Where do we go?
Without doubt.
The girl says she booked us to the Maldives.
Stop, stop! Oh, Maldives' daughter, enough, excellent.
And it works to entertain you.
I thought you came back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why children were invented?
I'm leaving! I'll take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you laughing, my dear?
Lock it! Please, if it pleases you, I will show you my son's face.
Oh! Son! What's the cause of your sadness?
When I see leather, I am sad.
He who bothers you dies (term) Welcome, son.
Forget her, cut her off, cut her off. Your father has plenty of money and there are many girls.
Lock up and I'll know my son, what bothers him, why he lives unhappy!
Oh! Just claim it and move on.
I seek refuge in God from its evil.
Say it to her three times.
You are dispersed. Wait, wait, don't close, two remaining.
Scattered, scattered.
Destroyed by something great.
Oh! My daughter, relax and forget, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Go, my daughter.
Oh, problem.
Since they saw you at the theater.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
I say, what's my mom? He already cut me off, told you you're cut off, cut off.
Why did he divorce you, that's important.
Now if someone were to head towards your village, what would you do?!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong with him! What has turned the world upside down!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and ignore him, and he won't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced from Abu Bakr!
My daughter is scattered!
Your daughter is exceptional.
Bought and produced in Toys R Us stores.
As if you now have a bad taste in your mouth for your daughter and feel disturbed.
They didn't do anything.
The cooked fruit didn't postpone you, so detach from it.
You are allowed to separate them as you wish.
She is still married to her husband.
Is this acceptable to you, let him go to hell!
Take care of what you've done for others.
What you reject for yourselves.
Don't accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land this mall is on?
What if it's in a strategic location?
"The rest is for God."
Also at a low price.
Closed.
I must get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, he'll come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm off work, and the problem I need the approval of Abu Sakr, I need it.
Go to his master.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, God bless you, is the office, not the house.
Do you eat as well?
What made this Abu Saqr full?
Everyone has a key.
Inform me, O Father Fahad.
Do you know him?
I don't know him, I only know him from TV, and you told me that you meet him during Umrah.
But we barely know each other.
Stop talking.
In the name of Allah, it is recommended to inquire about the reason for this festival.
There is no need for that, God guides you.
The month is thirty days long and has fifty dinners.
I suggest that Your Excellency be included in the Guinness Book of Records.
As the world's largest party manufacturer.
Since you, who is this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
This is a delight for the beloved.
So, father of the gap!
She says Abu Sakr serves dinner every day.
This is what we see.
But, oh master of folly, dinner tonight is for a special event.
Today, God has blessed you and your son, Sacer.
God willing, it is deserved from you, sir, with thanks.
This is here, hello son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For the case, my son Sakr has to go to the office tomorrow and transfer the car he wants.
I waited a year and a half for approval.
I was closed.
But when I reached him
And I give him money.
In the name of Allah, Abu Sa'd eases you.
Things don't work that way.
I told him good.
He has to pass by the exhibition place and move the car he likes.
We buy three for him.
Bring it!
Bring me to him.
She told me that you met him in Omaha last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
He is full of pride.
This is an opportunity for you.
Pass by his side and bear with him.
He deserves to be warmly welcomed.
Shahin! Father of Sakr.
God bless you, thank you, folks!
Thank God Shahin is fine, sir.
God bless you
Since you, who are you?
My lord
You didn't recognize me.
I don't lie to you (fixed)
My lord, I was with you on the umrah of last year.
I remember you bought a red chain.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
To be loved for your genuine kingdom.
So, Sacre, are you still hesitating about entering the offered trade or have you already decided?
I'm tired of him.
Why, sons of Sager, is trade good?
You must start, open an office, then see.
Abu Sakr
Sir, no.
Why?
I have a gift for you.
Entire building
And if trade becomes difficult for you and turns away from you, you say: No.
Who has everything today like you? Because you bought the permit, everything is easy for you, a free car and a better office space on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz told your father that if Saqr wanted to join this business, I would allow him to be my partner with a 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
The girl doesn't force me to do something I don't like.
And you are scattered that agencies, buildings, and vehicles are presented to you for free.
This is an opportunity, son! Starting a project at this time without capital?
Your only source is the people's love for your father.
Be smart and push him.
I trust you, [son]. This is your chance of a lifetime.
Rose quickly prepares the afternoon meal.
He also reached the vegetables and garlic.
Nothing is left, nothing is left, I'm afraid the samosa agency will take it.
Your son is interested in a good business deal.
It's what I wished to see, do you know what he told me today?
My mother told me she wants to expand her investments.
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And Allah is ashamed before the eyes of the lovers.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday that your son has entered this field.
He has 20 agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
**T
I think, and he has the right, they haven't opened it yet.
Yes, the one in the northern area of our office, what's wrong with it?
No, but I love him.
Thank you and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What you're saying, man! A whole year of worry and toil to get the supermarket ready.
What's that? I think he passes by the store every day.
He saw that and sent me his assistant, whose name is Samer.
He told me that this is Saqer, son of Abu Saqer, and he wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Does he want him to be your partner?
There is no power or might except in God.
Have you started talking to him?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said: Actions!
Why did you tell him you own an Iranian grocery store?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What was the name written on the sign?
The bakery next door was written about.
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
So, how's work going for you?
Fine, sir. We hope to finish drawing the plans for the future company buildings tomorrow or the day after.
No, no, Mr. Sakr, she is my wife Elisa, let me introduce you to Mr. Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
So you can take one of the company cars.
Many thanks, you're very interested.
Cooking now is based on science and study.
Today, someone says I want to work in business, he has some money and wants it to be invested.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
A person like this.
Do you think he will be saved? I don't think so, he will stay in prison.
Did you hear that, Abu Nasser?!
Did you hear what these two jars are saying?
What is this?
You own my son, Saqr.
Look at him.
Look at him today.
Sir, we're not talking about your son Saqr.
We talk about the system.
Your son is a reader, praise be to God, not like me, he's an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the rules.
You are afraid, my son is building himself up by himself.
He once gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And everything God wills is seen now.
Oh! I see, we're talking about ordinary people.
I will walk among them, and as Abu Nasser did to him, they took him and put him on the road.
He has business skills.
Strong economic feelings.
We are asked, "Who is his father?"
I swear I'm surprised.
God willing.
Gulf Financial Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Enter.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong with him?
I swear, Selim, I don't know what to say!
Yes, I remember.
The story is true.
They say the company sent a fax to my parents.
And inform him.
He couldn't stand him.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
And that he has worked on it a lot of resources.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when he became strong, he turned against me.
What did the doctor say?
Ask for him, O Salim.
I am surprised.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without letting his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
The donations of this institution are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, if God wills.
In the name of Allah, the Most Great, the Most Merciful, our goal in Sadaqah Siquar is to achieve cohesion in this nation.
By adding sixty beds for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Finally, we now support seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only 132 riyals.
We will answer in time.
Then we'll come to you right away.
Who is this girl?
This is Khalid and his wife, and they are inviting us to a meeting at the hotel tonight.
Sure, anywhere, anywhere, as long as we're together, I'm happy.
Oh my beloved, may God's support be sufficient for you regarding me.
Oh! My darling.
This is unfair. This is my source of income.
This bakery
And they took your money in your interest.
Five rials for seeds, three rials for hot bread.
He shouted at Ali.
Five bean seeds, okay, okay.
Cook six town seeds!
So let's go, friends of the explorers!
The captain is here and has brought breakfast.
He needs men.
Please, sir!
So what?
No, no, what I'm asking you for is to hear the ring of "yes" in my ear.
Hello Nora
I'm upset with you.
Do I bear your anger?
So what's the problem?
Why are you laughing?
Nora chose simple and clear clothes.
Don't say Onod will see sorrow.
Oh my God, Lebanese people speak with "Sayyid."
And do not wail over him excessively.
I'm simple, I'm enthusiastic about her.
The best clothes for the most beautiful night.
He is obsessed with Nora.
Get your blood boiling, how long will it take?
I paid twenty thousand, and twenty thousand riyals remain.
Delivered to you (repaired), blessed!
God have mercy on you.
Hello, Mrs. Salama is respected.
Hello Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
I am at your service (term).
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I got it, dude! Simplifier.
Did you like the joke?
So, do you have the design with you?
You don't have time to do them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Frankly, you have better taste.
They will change from us, longing for the meaning.
When he realized that my project was good and started generating income.
They say he will do a project like mine.

This is Abu Nasser who has no relation to trade.
Creatures of banks
Brotherhood will harm his brother.
This is how it is in these days.
Yes, yes my brothers.
You know I was sleeping, and they came to me and started saying that your brother wants you.
Everything is fine! I'll answer any question you have!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
I hope so.
You have no intention of a project, for example, like, like.
Are you coming to find a partner or something?
I heard you were busy, so I thought I'd drop by somewhere you might be.
Welcome.
If you need a lift, we've got it.
Thank God, everything is going well.
What am I doing, Abu Saleh?
But we're late, they bought it last week.
Yes, they did.
Undoubtedly, this could be good if God wills, goodbye.
So, here it is.
Are you sure?
And the house of luxury fashion, you know the big disaster!
What is it?
He bought a space next to your shop.
(Overstatement) You are imprisoned! (Overstatement) You are hated!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You must know.
Let your heart be open to your brother.
I won't go ask you.
You deny, lie, and laugh at me, and you told me, O you,
I wanted to work in secret.
Moving to the neighboring store disrupts my business.
But they did not say, "Go," and they were like a disease next to wisdom teeth, you are emptying me of reason.
This is hatred and animosity, I swear, I'll hit you, this is hatred, leave me alone.
Surely, you are from the family, O family!?
You're crazy, Abu Sale!
Keep me with him, I swear I'll hit you, ha! You're the one talking in a loud voice, you.
I'll hit you the way you hit me by stealing my piece.
Perish, O ye people!
Say, "Peace be upon him, O people."
I swear, I swear, you didn't do anything.
He instructed me to send a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why Lebanese in particular?
They talk to him, laugh and laugh and feel very comfortable.
This is why Abu Sallem brings Lebanese.
He started telling me some good words and convincing me.
He aroused me, he aroused me with his words.
He convinced me and led me to pay ten thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, a copy of it for nine hundred reals.
And you get money.
Bring a designer from Lebanon.
Can I meet with the gentleman? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, and it's difficult today as well?
Yes, today is also difficult.
I feel that Abu Salim has changed in recent days.
What do you have?
No, I don't know. What's the problem?
Abu Sallem is psychologically tired after his brother opened a store and brought in a Lebanese designer like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been decreasing.
This is the problem here in Qatar, no Qatari citizen opens a store, unless another Qatari citizen comes and does the same project and opens a store next to him, can I go in?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now, and they're thinking of a solution.
What are we doing now?
We sit as if we had eaten charcoal.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even make the rent.
A remote location away from them.
This means we'll lay the ground for them.
So no problem, and what's the discount?
No way, why don't you offer a free dinner dress with every wedding dress?
There's no way, let's go.
What happened? They're having a promotion at the store next to yours today, offering a free evening dress with every wedding dress purchase, plus a 25% discount.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, the same ad will be published, buy wedding clothes and get two trendy outfits free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I think the same thing, if we leave them, they will defeat us.
Don't worry.
What else did he do?
So, it's an absolute challenge.
Of course, this is a challenge.
Go, he deserves it, that criminal, he doesn't want anyone to earn a living.
If it happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days. I'll close my shop.
Excellent.
Wait, wait, keep the phone off, keep the phone off, I'm coming to you now, okay.
What's that only?
Saud says the shop is unacceptable and no one can sit there, and he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell is not related to the cooling system, there's no way.
Its smell doesn't leave the place for at least two hours.
100% sure.
He came at night.
Cut off the electricity to the store.
Is this fair?
Now will you answer the commitment or shall we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will end his life from this world.
Oh! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened. No one is coming to our grocery store.
Abu Nasser, lift, lift, there's a customer coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He's in bed, complaining.
He was saying it's a psychological state, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and asked for the payments.
Debts accumulated under his responsibility due to his younger brothers.
What happened to him this time?
They would be terrified, if they mistakenly entered and saw Saad the designer, screaming in his face and running away from him.
Offspring! O my Lord, verily it grows open-eyed, and climbs up the fish.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is in the store.
He bewitched him; I don't know what he did to him.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, what made him care!
He brought me down, he brought me down.
I owe you so much.
I'm afraid they'll detain me.
And I have no evidence to prove that, in order to sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget him, he deserves it.
Please tell me what kind of magic you did to him; you turned his designer into a creature that women need to fear seeing.
I caused a recent news story.
"No, folks, tell him the shooting team needs you justified."
Hello everyone, may God bless and protect you. Tell them you are urgently needed, urgently.
I swear they'll raise my blood pressure, kill me, punish me. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
This is acceptable, Ahmed, don't get angry. You have heart problems, this is not suitable for you, man!
I lie, I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but it does no good. These additions will work on me, they will work on me.
Don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll give you information.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed, we want to finish.
So I'll stop firing because the added player doesn't show up.
What an amazing experience!
I have nothing to do with this, Mr. Abdullah. Why are you shouting at me?
My beloved, if I didn't want anyone to call out to you,
What happened to Abdullah?
The extra is late and they are in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, dear.
Look for someone with a reputation and standing who can convince people that he can really be a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and sit down, and your requests will be ready within half an hour.
No one, Ala'a, no one, I was just explaining to him.
No, I'll manage myself with two series instead of one.
You are responsible, and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What are they not doing now?
They will do everything, be aware that the manager is stressed and there is chaos, but they will handle it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
Do you know what the manager said?
I know someone, I hope he suits you, I wish he were suitable.
%PW Profit to the Hawthorn!
Saud was a thorny bush! I remember him as Saud Bokthorn.
Yes, he was called Saud Bokthorn when he was young, and when he matured, he was characterized by Kaanse.
Why did he sweep?
I'll tell you the reason. Poor man, he used to walk the streets, carry crates, and work for the price of a kilo.
Hello, my rich and honorable brother, it's not a disturbance.
His appearance is suitable, as I recall, he is muscular and stocky, not tall or lanky.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Since it's possible, but you need to prepare it with high quality, and I guarantee that it's appropriate and funny as well.
Don't, don't wait, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Susan's house?
What is he saying?
Lock, lock.
Saud was cleaning.
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kans.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yes, correct.
But this is not Black Friday.
This is Saud's laptop.
Undoubtedly it is, but it changes over time because the computer is like textiles.
He is tall, fat, and lives in a red house.
He ditched the cans and started collecting old computers. Come on, come on, come on! You can do it, man!
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a cow? Where's the other one?
I don't know, son.
This is what you always wear.
I simplified one, where is the other Gotra? Where is it?
Holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks and Axe oil.
I'll heat the iron a little before you leave, as it's cold.
But today I feel worse.
Mother, I hope God guides you. Since yesterday, I've been insisting that you go to the ICU, but you refused.
N, my mother, said they would pay me.
Thank God, you now work instead of being worked.
Balaash, my mother, Moody.
You will challenge her, eat, and look up.
You sit and move slowly, slowly, and the camera keeps up with you, it will take you aside.
Yes. Forgiving! Yes.
Whose laptop is this?
IPod, this is a very famous actor, Abdullah Al-Lamaia.
This is for you, Leah, Dad, how are you?
How are you, Abd?
Force yourself, my dear, to act a little bit reputably in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm, stay calm, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, I wish they'd give me a role where I can hit you.
As if you know, brother.
Ventilated, do you know she didn't sleep last night? Oh, my brother!
Asthma, my brother, I hope God heals you.
In the name of God, He conceals her.
"Just a bag of apples" (idiom).
Hello, sir! Hello, sir!
Do you have a decongestant for my mother?
He is an official, not a doctor.
Look at you, listen to what he says, he has no reason.
What is his mother's name?
You're messed up, don't you think?
Did you hear what she said about you?
She tells you that you're spoiled and you need to be more balanced.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix the broken tires on my car.
And give him three million to bring me dinner.
I was going to ask you why you speak like that.
Because I am simplified by some people's requests.
Look, Mr. Ghufail, our production in the neighborhood, people of a high level.
Now excellent, fits the role.
Perfect, I'll help you, I have scenes that I don't have, right?
Did your family buy this?
"Just a bag of apples" (idiom).
Bring the gentlemen to the dressing room, start doing their makeup, and I'll tell Salem to bring you the clothes and come to you.
Go, go, go, this is excellent.
No, no.
Listen, brother, keep the car with us after we're done shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
That's fine, but is there anyone to pick me up?
"I'll give you a lift! Okay, I'll ask our driver to take you. All right, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait."
No, call your friend, the one who is added, call him.
Oh! People call black laptops from the makeup room.
Let my mouth be cleaned.
This is already written in front of me.
No, shall we correct again?
This means I!
I don't expect that from you.
We'll fight, for what?!
We will fight for our rights.
Yes, wait.
And He knows that you are seeking the pleasure of whom you are seeking, O Abu Abd al-Aziz.
Why did he divorce her? Ah! The brother?
I found them and that's all.
And we will marry off the daughter of whoever seeks refuge.
No need, what do you think?
He will clean it later. The important thing is that you get ready because you are going to enter the fitting room to change your clothes, and we are ready to shoot.
I'm brushing, toothpaste is expensive.
Hello everyone, the recording of this scene has been postponed.
Why is this?
I don't need tea, brother. I'm tired and my body is shaking from the tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour. How long do I have to wait?
"You didn't see anything, it's very common."
In the name of God, may He guide you.
They are fast.
Thank you, sir. May God protect you.
Send my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz is counting on you.
Don't lie, sir %PW.
It was fun, wasn't it?
He who resembles you, respects you and speaks for you.
The first time he complained to me about his nose.
How do they kiss them on the nose?
This is a problem.
He blew it like a chocolate spoon, cut your lip. It was fun, it was fun.
You didn't laugh!
Don't mention it.
Can I be an actor?
What's the problem? What's wrong with your voice?
Son, son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
They communicated quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
See it for yourself, man!
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of respect.
What happened, son?
Peace be upon you, what's the problem with you, sir?
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Do not worry, God willing, you will be able to study, take your place here, here.
Yes, Dr. Hani, what happened?
I promise you comfort in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, if God wills her to be safe.
Hello, hello sir, hello.
Lock up or I'll slap you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
You are calling me, my lord!
How are you, sir?
May God torment you (noun)
Yes, sir.
Hello sir, sit down.
God bless you.
With this appearance, the toy is (pictured).
Go with him, Mr. Rashood.
I swear, if I don't do something for you, let me know and I'll see what I can do for him.
Hello, friend. Can I quickly find a doctor?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it changes.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Oh! Hurry up, son, I'm sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, you haven't found anyone like them, they are good and consider everything.
Different from female citizens.
Don't forget the female citizens.
Forget it, look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
But, my brother, you're testing my patience.
Undoubtedly, try to approach her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intentions are good.
Nothing, nothing's wrong.
Answer with your behavior.
Or leave, leave, if you don't leave, I'll call security, so they can teach you a lesson.
No, no, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
Because I'm simple.
No, thank you.
You can take it and go back to the doctor.
The one who is talking to you is Faleh Al-Marzouq.
Marrying him means you're marrying him.
No, no, I need the beach, clothes, and the car, I'll rent them from you.
I'll give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
So let's go.
What is this %PW for the marginalized!
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
The lights of my eyes got married yesterday.
I want to arrive.
They were amazed by what I did for them; it was a wonderful and generous party.
One is addicted and the other is dietary.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Father, I promised my friends I'd meet them tomorrow at work.
Are you taking this for them!
Sure, what's wrong with it?
Nora, come here!
What is this?
This thing will be taken for pictures by friends, because of the poses.
Don't even think about doing it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something special.
Yes, but I'm confessing to them now.
And I need to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can serve something that pleases people.
Enough! Let's go.
It's at a reasonable price and has excellent quality.
Above average, but not the best!
Of course there's premium chocolate, but I'm sorry I thought you were looking for something more affordable.
It's very expensive. Why are you looking for something more expensive?
This is amazing, check out these technical details.
This is called King Chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested at the Spanish royal court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, happy to see you!
I'm dying here, brother. Give us some of that chocolate, brother.
What's the reason for this, man?
No, it's Abdelkader, the one in accounting.
By God's grace, it's worth it, give me another one.
And bring the coffee quickly.
The girl, did she go to their wedding?
Yes, ma'am, I went to their wedding, it was embarrassing, humiliating. Can you believe it, sister!
Did you listen to your sister's words?
That's why I want to offer you a marriage unlike any other.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I will organize everything.
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You don't live in society, you don't see how people put everything they have into their marriage.
And you saw for yourself.
When I bought something beautiful, I saw how they praised you and considered your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's amazing and wonderful?
Sure, but how much did you pay?
All the money we saved for chocolate is being used for the visitor's four-course meal.
Don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and be done with it.
This means they'll consider anything we choose.
Ouch, it contains a very bad meaning.
What's your opinion at this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was excellent!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought of creating a space like a mouse device.
I excuse you, for a minute.
Discuss everything except the stage and arrangements, this is the place where women with nothing remain, but are dismissed, shut your mouth.
The man is waiting for us.
We will move on to the expanding phase.
This is a very strange stage.
The latest model in 2010.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, it's all for your own good.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you'll have to pay an extra two hundred thousand, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and fifty thousand.
Acknowledge your opinion and we'll be ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think, you'll see your marriage in Comoros? That's how things are in our country.
And we are also at the beginning.
If you don't need a platform, where do you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and a piece of wood.
People are transient.
They are exploiting and manipulating us; in fact, they are criminals.
So what's the problem with you now?
Are you tense and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's acceptable.
I will call the wife and tell her that Sallam is going through a difficult time.
Doesn't he want to get married? Can't he afford the wedding? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received an assortment of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
And the Middle East region as well!
Add to rent.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and twenty-seven, okay.
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know who the perverts are.
Undoubtedly, they are reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
You will create a problem that we cannot fix.
In the name of God, please be kind.
But if God guides you, you would try to analyze things.
For me, thank God, I have decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say their marriage will only cost you a thousand dollars and that it's enjoyable.
God bless you, my dear.
If God wills, her wedding will be next month.
You just need to specify how many cards you want and transfer them to me.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where, when, and that's it.
You only know him, but you don't know what people say.
People learn the standards of marriage from wedding invitations.
Yesterday, if they saw their invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
"Seek refuge in the shrines, for if their supplications are answered, they will not see a supplication go unanswered."
We didn't say anything like that, we'll handle it online.
It has a cloth cover, cat skin, and a silver sheen.
You can't be held responsible, you can't pin me down.
I'll be controversial to women, we'll handle our invitations, meaning we'll be the ones asking for invitations!
I feel sorry for him, man.
Alas, of course his family put a lot of pressure on him.
Oh! Anyone who steals money from everyone.
What he says, even selling his car.
He looks ten years older, today I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my poor brother, I don't know when we'll develop.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
What does it mean to build within my budget?
Why, do I live alone?
The issue that society suffers from is the emergence of appearance, self-recognition, and excessive display.
Forces you to get the same illness
If you want to live there.
Once, I ran for the new mother.
She hit the nail on the head with her phrases.
Trust in your Lord.
Since you asked me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I must be crazy.
Even if I decided to get married, my brother!
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says, "Your country!"
We decided to bring a DJ.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous artist for her son's bride.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you laughing?
It seems you don't like what I do!
It's enough that he sold his car and that every day a friend travels with him.
Before that, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Salem is tired, my mother stopped for him.
I don't care about any of you or yourself.
I'm not younger than people.
Don't make us laugh.
I beg my mother, enough, my brother has worked hard and taken care of everyone.
Please stop.
My mother is asking for something new for the party, and my brother told me that I don't have it, so she screamed at him, and he told me that I will cancel the party, and I don't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She is being brought in and they are giving her first aid.
He said she was much better and they would find her a room in the hospital.
What evil!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to help you sleep.
How do I relax and want to be made a mockery of, whether good or bad?
I was telling him to bring Abdullah Rawaisa, and he told me he didn't have any money.
I feel sorry for your mother.
Take care of her.
Go to her, go to her and throw it on her head.
And tell her that I'll do what she wants.
I will bring Abdullah's reports to the gentlemen.
Abu Yusuf is generous; I don't think he won't help me.
It is not fair, you didn't find anyone except Abu Yusuf.
What's wrong with him!
Are you crazy, Sallem?
But the minister kept him because he is senior and, moreover, he is dedicated and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing I told him, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
Because you are going through a bloody turbulent situation and need to request an amount from Abu Youssef's Ministry funds.
But Allah knows best when you will return to Him.
And when the rightful people came and asked him about the money,
Of course, he might be in trouble.
No one will know, and he will learn how to deal with it.
This is on your head; the man is in his office, and you must take responsibility if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my old age!
Brothers don't call it stealing.
On the first slide.
Here, here's a white box covered with blue thread, containing a circle with a picture of a bird's wing, bring it, bring it.
No, my brothers Abu Yusuf, it is I, if I did not face difficulties.
I'll pay it all back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And you entered the end of my day.
And surrender to me, O Thursday!
Year, year.
Horse, listen to what I say, if someone else had been hitting him or something bad had happened to him, oh!, oh!, oh!, Khalid.
Year, year.
All the ways I've tried are useful, Yusuf's brother, I am dying.
I cannot change or undo the marriage.
And you know them, all of them are sealed.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the tension board, the tension board.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Father Yusuf, he filled the register with cards, which card do you need?
The bag with the picture of a nervous man.
I'm booking two rooms for hair and clothes just for us.
And they will be with us from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Rawaisa and his team.
You'll see, dear.
No, I'm not telling you.
The season will be delightful.
We are the first in the world to use it.
Mom Mom
Blah blah.
There is no god but God.
Son, don't forget to read the salutations when you enter the chat room.
Women here have a cursed eye.
I already told you that it's excellent.
The best groom in the world, may God protect you, I don't want to rush you.
Father, father, the police are closing the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding.
The people who simplified the registration have arrived.
And now I'm done for, I'll be arrested, oh God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that's not fair if that happens!
The company awarded a contract worth three million, but only two million was allocated for materials.
He wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there are excesses, but they don't go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
I wonder, what did the minister say to Uthman?
And was there none among us who would criticize him? They say he was with him!
I don't know about him, I swear I don't know.
Where is morality?
Right has become wrong and wrong has become right!
Oh! Saad, did you make sure the minister stopped it, oh! People, what happened in the world?
Just call him!
What's left?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
The girl is in a relationship with the minister.
An amazing world (term).
What's wrong with you, didn't you know who she was?
This new worker that the minister bought instead of buying Osman the Just.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Salim? Oppose the minister!
Are you crazy?!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, and we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here, he stands next to the elevator.
This is the reward for honesty and frankness, my brother Salem.
I wish we could do anything for you, brother!
Thank God, thank God for everything.
What's wrong with you, man?!
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see unbelievable things.
I'm available to you.
I want you to pass by the retail market after work and bring us back some vegetables for the salads.
I'll try, okay, bye.
Who's driving my sister home?
They were sitting in the front, laughing and talking. Who were they?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he drives me home? Fine.
Oh my God, I can't believe it, why do you look like you've been told off?!
What are you saying?
Do you hear what we're saying?
You're old-fashioned.
This is an old and new matter about right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that unite the world and that no one can follow.
The more I live, the more I see!
Don't blame me, Munira. It's not fitting for me to be tense or angry.
This is one of the things he saw that day.
Tell her he's sorry.
Life isn't going the right way.
Don't worry, go and have dinner.
Prepare me to grow to greatness.
The president is not annoyed with you.
Is the president not annoying?
No, you're not disturbed, go wash your face and have dinner.
Don't worry, man.
I'm very excited to meet you on the first day of work.
This is a delight for the beloved.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
But at the same time, it is very important.
To recall some values and principles that are acted upon.
In the public interest.
This is what your presence is supposed to be.
We must all
Logistics are very important to Fakhri.
To be plagiarists
Thank you, thank you all.
What I also want to say
And warning you about my first day at work,
There is someone among you who works.
Who is truthful, truthful, consistent, and free from such bad things?
Just a shadow of doubt.
That there is an honest employee.
To be able to take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, nothing will move as Your Honor wishes.
Thank God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, Sir, I will say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, sir.
Headmaster, you have been praised highly, may God bless you.
Undoubtedly, sir.
Oh! Your master knows how to choose.
Since God guides you.
Why did you let Satan rule you?
You need to thank God that the matter was just a lie.
Mom, why is Dad detained?
Lock up, daughter!
No, no, I won't do it again.
Mom, why is Dad registered?
Ends.
This means he has become honest.
It is shaped to say that your father is honest.
Is this clothing?!
Your whole body is covered.
What do people see?
And I hope you look for a job, no one will hire you when you're like this.
Is there a good woman who covers her body and attractiveness?
She covers her chest, she wears it even here, she talks to herself.
I'm tired of this, son.
And I bought her a jacket and pants that reveal her midriff above the belly.
But it's an impossible case, she doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I tell you!
You'll only correct yourself.
The question is about your daughter Sarah's hand in marriage to our son Rashid.
One of us is looking for a suitable man for his daughters today.
I'm telling you, Rashid is my son.
He is a very good man.
Can't stop drinking (slang).
It's closed for 24 hours.
Irrigated, early, and spacious all day.
And do not ask about the cooling breeze.
He is a healthy breeder.
I also say that it is abominable.
And how long will he be deported for?
This is what I expect from you, and how much are the drugs?
This is clear, it's finished. I'll give you five riyals. If you find its equal, I'll hold a competition for it.
Since you are Sarah's father, we only come to ask for her hand.
Known for his joy and mirth.
We know she comes from a polite family.
Thanks to the son, thanks, that's how life goes, thanks.
I am mute.
I can't walk.
Without doubt, head towards,
Just stop.
Forget it, call your dad and ask him to come pick you up.
Why should I call him?
So, he can come to pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's there, appearing beside him freely next to a wild girl.
Frankly, your father is walking on eggshells, playing it safe.
Hello my dear daughter Mona!
Glory! His name is Abdulaziz.
Yes, correct.
You've missed me, my daughter.
And you know the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 2009, after signing the comprehensive ceasefire with the State of Israel,
Israel continues to practice extremism, pressure, and siege on him.
The last was what the Israelis and their Arab friends stirred up about the Palestinians.
They are transporting plastic clips through the canals.
Especially Article Two, Paragraph A, which stipulates that Palestinians must cut their nails daily.
Let's move on to the fateful meeting.
Mr. Al-Murrad,
When Israel recognizes the establishment of the State of Palestine,
Oh! A man! What you say, oh! A man? Defaming people and forget about me!
Please!
Excuse me, Mr. Tiger, excuse me, Mr. Boss.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fulfilled the commitment to the comprehensive international agreement.
What is the Israeli representative saying?
To find something stable, like a rock or a plastic as a promise
Oh! Even our homes.
What do people in the Gulf call it?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies are making cars of wood for us according to the agreement.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a crucial point, and I will vote on it because nail lengthening is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hands.
But I had a very strange dream.
To control the students.
I'm tired of twisting it.
This is the fourth school that I'll start working at tomorrow.
Because I established my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The young ones follow him and weave his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times did he come to me without his coat?
The manager told me.
Rashid is loving and we want to keep him.
The two children are throwing stones at him.
They wove his family into the gap before everyone.
And they said, "This school is mediocre and allows everything."
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Mary died.
What's the secret of ketchup, this is new, no one told me!
They threw every ketchup belly at once.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw children laughing at him in the playground.
Ends.
Since the main teacher you will be working with tomorrow contacted me.
But, no problem, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The age of expansion and weakness has ended.
Welcome, my brothers, welcome Abdullah.
You will see a different Rashid.
And there is no need to remind you of an important educational phrase.
You graduate in education and I graduate in education.
And we all know the quote,
The student is the son of the first grade.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
And if anyone does wrong,
He'll be in trouble.
When he started to speak, he just told him to shut up.
You will see what I ask him.
Some of you lied to me and said, "Forgive and forget"? Who?
You're the one who told me to ignore and stop!
No, I'm not.
So the person next to you, you!
Rise, go to the school principal.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, did you hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
Don't just be like this on the first day, you should be like this all year round.
Learn its consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
While I explain or speak.
You know what will be.
Anxiety means, do you know what is meant by "anxiety"?
Means tense.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard it too.
Take after school.
Go to the school principal.
Go out and forget everything now!
Take out your things.
I don't care.
Of course he's still looking for it.
No, teacher, we didn't see him.
Since, strawberry slices with cream cheese inside are excellent.
I am the servant of Rahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and man is fallible.
"Stop it, son."
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
I don't want it, I want the chocolate in my bag.
Blash, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I'm available to you.
She says he is happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich boy and a regular boy.
Disasters, why do disasters appear blue or red?
I connect, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was in front of them all, one juice and one bread.
I took it before them all, I bothered them. My friend Abdelrahman, and for him this is very useful.
Forget it, go to Saud and get the PlayStation code from him.
So what do we conclude from this story?
This man
He must have morals.
This thing that he simplified, he also told me to bring my simplifier once.
No, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing now.
We study for the exam.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted into a graduate program.
So, I thought I should submit the event file before traveling.
How shall I receive you in the evening? Abdurrahman told me, but not where he was going, but he didn't tell me the time!
Since his father has returned and he has no details, praise be to God, I have placed and expanded.
We say that I didn't take it in the afternoon, that he got upset, and that he told his son, "No, no, no, a disaster, no, no."
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman.
In the name of God, He seeks your comfort.
What is done is a thing.
Do you prefer it, do you prefer it like this?
Today, children, we begin a new lesson in science.
And peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, and there's no request from you, I'm with you.
Doctor, doctor. How do you ask the doctor for water?
Is there any teacher offering water to a student, are you his tea assistant? This incident will not pass like this, I will write it in the report.
And you laugh at me, you laugh at me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, did you hear me or not?
This is enough for whom?
Good, how many cars?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, his parking his car in front of our houses will be at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Good, I broke the table.
Don't worry, brother!
Why is this?
Are you exceptional? (term)
Your behavior towards me has changed.
Am I your mother?
We didn't say anything, bro!
What is this?
Listen, keep everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother?!
What do you mean by "no need" when I want to ease your burden?
What are you saying?
Alternatively, what do they call it?
It seems you want to.
You want it, you got it.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
It doesn't suit him, that's not fair!
The neighborhood doesn't have a source.
We praise Abu Nayeef to speak with tranquility.
Who is this Rashid who does what he wants in the region?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Stop, people, be quiet and help him. Let's hear what Naif's brother has to say?
Now, this unmeasurable rascal is playing with your mind!
I'm finishing it.
If I don't hit him in the face, he'll keep doing what he's doing.
The game is played by its players (term).
Is this acceptable?
Wait.
I haven't seen anything yet.
Did you know he now has a jewelry store!
That's why I see you wearing all these earrings and rings.
In the name of God, we complete.
Just walk, do you stay in the heat?
I can't believe that the simple and poor Rashid has become like this.
Became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Remember him, and restore him; you are a teacher and he is a teacher, but wait, where is he now and where are you now?
Don't mention it.
Don't mention it, Abu Abdullah.
I'll tell you the secret.
The doctor has arrived, the doctor has arrived.
Doctor, I didn't do anything!
Doctor, do you know who he is?
Yes, man, I know who he is.
Here I tell you, we won't get a chance as good as this.
I'm looking for a job! This is fun, I assure you this is fun.
No, Khalid, the work is in my hands.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
My parents sent him.
My mother sends you her greetings here. I hope God protects him, I will tell him, he sends him greetings.
Enough, hello dear, in God's care (term).
What more do you want, your brother will be elected a minister, but believe him, my son!
Oh! Mom, we'll work, we'll work at a high level.
But, son, if you worked with him, what would be said?
He just did it like that.
This thing is acceptable, right?
Sure! This is automatic, without a doubt.
So, my beloved, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
The goal is to build a tower between the two shore towers.
Go, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Father Sallem.
Your friend seems disturbed.
It doesn't look like it, brother!
You can do it, Father Sallem.
Do you believe that he got up, took the phone, and gave it to Abu Salim?
You know, there's something behind this, and in a million ways, Abu Sultan is carrying it with anger.
His relationship with Abu Sallem was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he's planning to do something else.
So, to this extent?
The car door opens for him!
Finally, the minister's car door is opened.
Oh! My son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes take place in the countryside.
But I don't believe what I hear!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women will start talking about it, and they won't mention the kindness of the consensus on the plates. She's spreading rumors about me among the women, my daughter!
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm surprised, I'm going to collapse.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
This is none of your business.
Illuminating, I'm working at a slow burn.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be a minister, not him.
I work, I have a plane.
"So be it."
Yes, plan.
He must trust me in the beginning.
They told me we chose him as a minister because he was elected two months before me.
Because I'm sure he'll quit his job.
Magic can be undone.
What is it?
What is this either?
And at every event he attends, the camera will snap numerous pictures of him until his photo becomes a common sight in the newspaper.
He breathes until he floats to the surface.
Are you sure?
Just wait. I'll work against him and show you.
In return, your happiness,
Of course, your happiness.
So, tell me.
Did I thank him for the sheep? Well, the meat was excellent.
The man is outside, go and see him.
Don't be a teller, people want to see a sign of your presence, and you want to insult yourself.
Minister only, enter, enter.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. Just His Excellency the Minister, a photo, a photo of Your Excellency.
Add one more.
Hello, my brother, I really love your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, too.
No, I tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big the picture he took with him is.
Say: "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is active in the social field, well, well, hello.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what you're going through.
Appears everywhere (term).
They are pilgrims, they make you pilgrimage. Only the tree that bears fruit is stoned (proverb).
Bring me to the market!
Is it not complete?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Sure, your name is Abu Daiz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
God has a famous personality.
You're home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, today I have a terrible headache, it's pounding, I feel pain in every part of my body, and my colon is acting up.
I'm tired, really tired. It's been a month and I'm still dealing with it.
Make me comfortable today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
May I say something?
Oh! A woman, I just want to take me.
I started to prefer her.
You know yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you noticed that.
Frankly,
Your minister is tense, it seems he loves this story.
I will send you, my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity, and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We serve you, welcome.
If God wants her to die, He will give her wings.
Peace be upon you, man, did you have a meeting here in the hotel last night?
Marriage?
Don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, is there a hotel behind you?
May I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
In the name of God, may God have mercy on him for everyone.
Does this minister allow us to sleep or rest?
This means he didn't find any party, wedding, or any problem to be solved for him.
He took him to a seven-thousand-dollar hotel and struggled to find something for him. He suffers from bad luck as if it's his face.
Just say, hello.
You didn't find a birthday for him, or did you?
Go, you might make it for the second half!
Each issue contains one hundred images.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired, my brother!
Oh! Man, the newspaper editor says the first thing is to get his picture ready, then make the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a contest about the picture of your minister.
Someone asks another, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
The prize winner moves.
The story isn't like that. You have to go to the coffee shop and work on the daily comments about his pictures in the newspaper. It's the details that keep going on and on.
Wow, his death is very recent.
As they say, when God wants an insect to die, it approaches the light.
People will attribute and attribute to him.
He became one of the most prominent celebrities in the country.
Don't mention him, nor who he is?
You've ruined my reputation.
May God restore you to him.
She said that we are all married except for poor Amal; she's the only one of us who isn't married.
This is my destiny.
Marriage is not my destiny.
And I forget about marriage.
God is sufficient for whoever supports him.
Do you see those adopted people sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see who is playing with their hair?
Is it the boy or the girl?
After my father's death, I mean he killed him.
You saw it grow, right?
It is not permissible for him to have a relationship with the worker.
Go and make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have one lady, she has two ladies for him.
I've told you a hundred times, don't interfere. Khalid is my son, not yours.
You don't have any other problem except for Khadija, the workers, the workers, and Khadija.
The girl, that's not good, Khalid is only 24 hours with the worker and doesn't love anyone else.
Just take it easy. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a moment, if I hadn't told your father about you.
I'll tell you something, what's wrong with Khalid?
Saud says Khulood uses makeup and acts like a girl. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh darkness, oh darkness, oh darkness!
Khaled put makeup on his face! It's just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and expressed it.
I saw a very small place, and even that is unclear.
He is Coordinated, a Master, and All-Hearing.
I will punish Saud.
I haven't seen you for a long time.
Last time, Saad asked you, what do you want to become when you grow up, and you didn't tell me. Now tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to become?
And you, my dear Khaldi, my dear Saad, will move to an office, and what do you want to become?
This year, we will go to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the waver in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khaled, and the cheetahs.
And he sent a recorder to Samurah.
I ask God for repentance.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can stay with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, dear.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow! Amala, I want to open my eyes and I should know that you graduated from university.
It seems that it's not a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it has a very strange smell.
Hello God, what's wrong with me?
The way you speak has become mysterious.
I forgot you were a man.
And I hope you don't speak to people this way outside?
I don't believe him, Khalid!
Get out of my room!
Oh mercy! Khalid!
You told me you neglected me.
Sure, you don't hurt my feelings, I'll definitely tell my parents.
This is my son, and I know him well.
You are weak, Khalid, my light. I wish all children had your compassion and feelings.
And when you see a person who is rich and concealing it, you say that he is concealing it.
It is unthinkable, unthinkable for you to say this about your brother.
"You've walked something meaningful."
Forget it, only an excellent scent is used. What's the difference between a men's scent and a women's scent?
Here I tell you, don't say that in front of your father.
I am stupid.
I'll show it to you, but be quiet, so Mohammed doesn't suspect anything.
How do these girls get together?
It's bad for a beautiful girl like her to do that!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he felt he was tied to something.
Prepare yourself.
I know you're monitoring the Bluetooth device today.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Sure, why?
Would you like something to drink?
I see that he's been sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother criticized him.
He is feared by him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
Ask for protection from the devil, my son, for me!
I have already booked.
I'm leaving. How do I face people? It's impossible!
And what should I say to your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, all of them cause problems, oh, all of them.
This is the end, Mom.
I remember when Khalid was small.
Of course, this result will be.
Ends, please exit.
The right thing always causes pain.
The jar caught fire.
I cannot live in Doha.
I can't interact with people.
My mobile has been off for a while.
Are you punishing me, Amal?
You are a girl and you spend your day at home.
What I'm saying is that I'm a man who meets people all day long outside the house.
This is difficult, Amal.
I cannot live with my daily, life, and mind settled.
Dad felt for a while that something was wrong at home and that there was a change.
Why is my father absent from the events that happen here at home?
Sometimes I punish the father and sometimes I don't.
I do not punish him, O Amal, when I remember his fatigue and discipline in his work, so that we may live with benevolence among people.
And I punish him.
When he leaves home and leaves the responsibility of the children to the mother.
We don't want to dredge up the past now.
Does the father know or not?
But I'm ready for the
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see my father's shock through my eyes.
I'll be thrilled.
Alright, Amal!
He knows how to breathe life into us.
It's better to know something than to know nothing at all.
I never thought our house would come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called Khalud exploded in it.
And the customs and traditions.
You will find them generous.
Close their ears to that.
And they do not wish to listen to him.
They only listen to one voice.
O pollution, you stranger.
And they descend upon every good thing.
Whatever comes to your mind.
You decided to surprise everyone by studying abroad.
We can say, but God willing, my son!
In the name of God, He seeks your comfort.
People who return bring gifts, those who leave do not.
You are right.
This is a rule.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal followed me quickly.
Did he see her, my daughter?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what happened to you?
Father, what's wrong with you, Father?
Father!
Don't worry.
You are a special person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't fire you because there was anything wrong with you.
I am separated from you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept to be the brother of my daughter.
I'm like your brother.
So they asked him.
She is here every day.
Before you come with you
She was hiding underground.
She was there before we were on the roof.
These are very strong words, can you handle such words?
Estimated 1200, you earn a lot of money!
Say what God wills.
Go, go.
You're only seven months old, stop the arguing and let's go home.
What a sudden feeling and a sudden shape! Every time he takes me to someone's house and asks their traveler, "How much do they give you?" Neither pleasing nor pleasing, and tomorrow he'll ask for a raise.
This driver is mocking you.
He came only seven months ago.
You're annoying me, my son, you're annoying me.
Send him back, so we can get rid of him.
Return it and leave another one!
Tell his son, he knows not what lies beyond this word! He knows not what it costs in time and money.
Leadership training. Send him back and get rid of him!
The first time she came to my house was seven months ago.
Undoubtedly, I will tell you something new.
Gas is now $1.40, before it was only 50 cents a liter. Everything is getting expensive, sir.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
When I first came to you, what was the salary I gave you?
He gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, new. You were expanded six months ago and your salary is 800 amounts.
I need money.
The drivers you're talking about are old, old, you're new.
Seven hundred is now eight hundred.
Go!
He said he would give you a raise of only 100 riyals.
And three hundred is of no use.
What I told you is what fits?
No, no screen. I'll be in trouble when I escape.
No, I'm afraid of dogs.
He who flees from his representatives.
Why are you afraid?
Because he was the owner of these people before.
Give them a salary of six to seven hundred. Do you know how much they get?
How much do you earn?
So, what's the cause of your fear?
I'm not afraid.
God is sufficient for him.
I preach to the choir and tell them outright.
There was no one.
You also stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
I did it!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and took it with them.
You may go, sir, you are permitted.
We'll do it everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
Those who put us in a predicament and harmed us.
I told you to send it back.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I will find him no matter who he is.
He will return, meaning he will come back.
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him back home than let him stay here and make money.
I simplified it, I hope I can find it.
Whoever enters now, no one buys now.
Initially, you seemed tense, as I observed.
But what were we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't score any goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the confrontation that you were fearful, you were scared of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they'll score less than 3 goals.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust you've placed in me.
The opposing team has nothing.
Excellent! The rabbits celebrated scoring a goal, you started by scoring the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
I'll just die, I'll make you happy.
Thank you, man.
Why bother, you can't outperform our team!
Sir, the match has started and its roles have begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "This is too complicated."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend, prostrate.
Take it, O Good News!
What has he made of himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Yes, man, he loves football so much.
Don't say that about my rabbit team.
They will think, they will think.
Go, Sajid, go, Sajid, hurry, hurry, the match is starting, hurry. Bring water with you, Fix will play today.
Welcome, viewer, with us today is one of the most prominent fans of the Fox Club, called Thalob.
They say you won because they were incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's incomplete? Each team has ten players.
If it's not one or two, it won't make any difference.
This fax is spacious.
This is our player's best fan.
Undoubtedly, in the context of Ahla!'s victory, Thaloub, a final word you'd like to say to the horse.
All words stop.
When they say the name of rabbits.
Her name is high in the sky.
This is the beloved.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him as enthusiastic as this.
Here we go, Hassan!
So, where is the football-loving Indian man?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Oh! Man, you've become a big star now, don't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in a village called Starbucks or Starbuck's, something like that.
I remember this young man, he came and sat with us at the cafe, and he didn't have money for tea.
The child gave me twenty riyals as a reward in front of him.
What made him like this?
Oh! [A person], sitting with the important managers at the club, helping him and doing everything he wants.
Can I say something else?
Yes, Father.
My father says: Whether you come or go,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This is Fox's team of my heart.
When you open my heart
You can export a lot of rabbits through it.
You didn't hear the poem your master wrote about the observer.
When we played with them.
Please, please, Thaloub, read it, read it, read it, read it.
Brother. Who, God knows my secret?
My spirit is attached to every limit.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're the Fox lovers' group.
You can't tell me the winner's name, so I can have a surprise.
We will head to a press conference, and if God wills, we will announce the name of the winner.
The one who spends.
The famous Thaloud, this beloved one who was threatened today by the management of the Fox Club with a broad, rare, and strange gesture.
Indeed!
Our wishes to you for this beautiful appreciation and that it is certainly a wonderful gift.
In your opinion, is it a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is behavior.
I tell you, this is it.
We must inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
The masses, all, all, all the masses.
No, no, no! Man, that's not it, that's just similar to it.
I'm telling you, that's it.
I was late.
I don't know the game times, brother!
Now how do we catch him?
We just need to wait a moment until the Bengals play their next game.
Here, here, I saw it.
Let's follow him.
Hello, brother, you were late...
Here, here, here, here.
Follow him, follow him, follow him, follow him.
The question that we don't know whether it is this or not?
I'm telling you, Dad, him!
I say with truth and wisdom that we go to them and ask them, telling them about the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Father, you always make things difficult.
We report it, I'm sure of it.
The earth, God has secured it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
And another land beside it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman Al-Subji is greeting you, hello, hello, hello.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken, son! We were coming to a friend and thought you were him.
God is good, He creates all people to resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, sir, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
"No problem, after your approval, I will apologize, and I will be your assistant. Ali, I hope God respects you, Ali, Ali."
And you say you're sure?!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm so nervous.
What did she do, Walid?
When, when, when I was walking, my hand burned in the bag.
And try to solve the problem now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father knows?
It broke into a million pieces.
No, Mother, let's buy something similar as soon as possible.
Before my father arrives.
Please, Mother.
You know your father, when he's done, he's exposed.
Go to your room and look, don't come out of it.
He did nothing.
He mistakenly hit the bottle with his bag, and it collapsed and broke.
Mom, I'm nervous about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the child, daughter!
You belittled him and scared him, do you want him to go crazy?
May I say something, daughter?
Where does he think the child went?
Blash, if he comes, I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Sister, I know where Waleed is.
Stay with me, I'll guide you to the place.
So we go. Oh God.
Here.
Hello Granny, I don't want to go home.
Keep me at my post.
I didn't see the flower.
I swear I don't know.
This is what scares you about your father, I hope he guides you.
Take me away, my son!
Don't worry, son, as long as you're at home, don't worry, son!
I simplified the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed!
Please, please Abu Waleed.
This time, I'll spare him for your sake.
What did I find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
No, my son, Walid, your father doesn't do anything for you.
Did you make sure, Dad?
Yes, my son, yes.
Will you leave him here? I'm afraid someone will trip over him.
He asked me and told me that I need to bring him one like the one Walid broke.
He wants the same thing. Go and find this only, and it's the last one in the store. It's surprising. Where are the children?
In the room, he studies.
Undoubtedly, he cares about his work.
Therefore, I'll quit this game.
Oh wow
Undoubtedly, study!
Just this game and we study.
I beg you, Father, don't tell my brothers.
Dad, don't tell the brother, dad, I think this is the last time.
I'll call him.
And you especially, you have belittled me, am I your friend at the cafe?
You will see that I did not tell your brother about you!
No, I won't call. Here's the phone in my pocket. If you study, that's fine.
The girl, why are you taking him to the doctor?
In the name of Allah, make it easy for you, O my mother.
He scares and yells at him because he hits him all the time.
This child is suffering.
Be patient.
Girl, where is Amoula? I don't see her with you today?
And you cover yourself with it.
My sister doesn't please my father.
Oh oh! Daughter, I didn't tell you about Monira's story with her son Naif.
"May God bless him, Abha is the same age as Waleed."
And reach the same height.
Yesterday she told me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He breathed with her and called out to her.
He says: Why didn't you tell me?
This is a psychological condition.
This is contrary to the boy's wish.
He must take his son and scold him in the middle of the garden.
And after that he said to him, Do it again, and cover yourself in your bed.
This is a lot of talk as if nothing (term).
What did you say, Salam?! Or is it Umm Munira?
I was telling her to eat, eat.
Eat and be happy.
I am accused.
Mother, Mother.
It's excellent that your father didn't find out about you.
But he will punish you by beating.
Stop, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father comes out, or I'll make a disaster out of you.
I don't hear what you're saying.
Retreat!
They cry and activate.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
They must be taken to their brother for punishment.
I'm nervous.
They were not failed, but were presented.
Why are you taking them to their brother?
Eagle got 48 out of 50
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Welcome, they have warned their brother.
I believe him, I agree with his opinion.
Forget the feeling.
My brother executes them.
No, I'll get, I'll get.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He wastes our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why can't you get fifty out of fifty?
Lock, lock, lock, I've caught you, but you don't hear what I say.
They don't listen to what I say.
Dishonored child!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Ah! Stop, Daddy.
Because you teach it well, you teach it again!
Stop, enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll let you jump one after the other, and you'll be like a pepper.
Learn by walking with your family in public places.
Causes us misunderstanding.
Doctor, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is very convenient.
It's strange to cry.
You're supposed to be happy.
Oh! Son, change everyone and get off the buses. You're waiting for someone to pick you up.
At the school entrance, meaning he's waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who killed himself today?
They gave him his certificate.
His family threatens him if he doesn't get full marks.
Wael, Wael. Run, Wael, run.
Hello and welcome to a new episode of our program "Without Borders."
Oil accounts for over 35 percent of total energy resources.
While the rest go to natural gas, wood, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf states alone own 686 billion barrels of Iran's oil.
With Iran following at 12%, then Iraq at 10%, then Kuwait and the UAE at 9%
Each of them comes from Venezuela by seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices surpassing $109 for the first time in history.
And so in this section we try to understand many of the puzzles related to oil.
And the problems faced by oil-exporting countries.
Despite its prices rising significantly.
and the problems faced by the population and residents in these countries
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What appears on the screen next time, or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because today the market is the main factor.
And non-producing countries
Today, what determines the price is market power.
No, he is not from OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a role.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
And trading markets and the rest
And moved on to prices in the estimate
"Commodities" like oil, for example
And he will reach a thousand dollars tomorrow, God willing.
Oil in 2004 rose from $44.
And today we see that gasoline prices are...
Scatter from day to day
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it rose in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring, and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always used, for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops to ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation now has power and control over the market.
A lot has changed since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Either yesterday or the day before, the overall commander of the Falun, the commander in the central region of Afghanistan and Iran, retreated.
His resignation sparked strong reactions due to its link with the anticipated U.S. war.
Political or Geopolitical Impact
It can quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The result will certainly come and will affect everyone.
In parallel, investors also respond to political impacts.
He might assert, he will say, that some will send you that the U.S. war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen in the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, any member, now in light of what the White House is saying.
This has brought the region back to a state of tension.
This is the contradiction.
But Fallon had seen this scenario.
Take a quick look at the oil market.
Today, we have proven with data that there is a shortage that does not exist.
Give me an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States, oil inventories have risen to more than half of the past five years.
Today, no, I mean, I want to say...
Do not use it even for the next war, because today I say that the whole world has a profitable stockpile.
Even today's global demand, you can choose any country and find a long queue in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks associated with this question?
What number do you expect? I don't know.
One hundred and two or one hundred and three dollars, maybe less but
You might arrive if these tensions become real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far from oil-producing nations.
You will see how the oil market is affected inversely.
Up to three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and the rest to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
Investing in it exceeds one hundred daily.
Tensions exist in the region and we are waiting.
April, as has been said before, will be the month to establish this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, Cheney.
In the area because now
This year is the year of elections.
And the current American system has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent 30,000 Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see it, but we do not expect events.
But I think this scenario won't happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America doesn't pay anything, they will pay you as Iran and the consumer countries do.
The United States today
Now it depends on Africa's papers and has many other alternatives.
Learn, there is no, let's speak clearly.
She said in the introduction of your presentation that 60%
Oil stocks
But now they issue twenty and two...
I minority them from Central Africa.
I'm from West Africa and all that is exported from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and specific precautions and precautions.
Deepwater production or deep-sea production from a large marine depth
Therefore, the gulf will move to a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They hand it over and destroy it.
The important means there
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
"Convertible (LNG), and thus these countries are considered a hard number."
And the need of countries for energy
It certainly means there's something called secure provisioning.
And without any internal opposition in the United States, even at the level of the general public.
But there are still some concerns.
President Bush turned around.
Try to notice how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
It means he didn't come, no, no, no, not about donation because none of us deal with donation.
No, there is a great exchange of kindness and mercy.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity.
Or to be spacious
But it is given to the West and not to anyone else.
Precisely with America
Where is the market?
Where do we find economic benefits to go to?
We won't win.
Like oil and gas
You will arrange it because of the knowledge.
I have the evidence.
I have the evidence.
My sixty minutes is no more than seventeen dollars.
No price rise.
But the U.S. dollar retreated as you insisted on consuming it.
You are at the forefront as a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Exports must be in dollars, and you refuse.
Currency exchange, even though the currency collapsed, and therefore
Even if returning is not in your best interest.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's the experts' opinion, not mine.
Sure, the dollar dropped by 30% and oil rose more than that decline.
This means that if we take the base year as 2004
We observe that oil prices are ranging between 35 to 36 dollars.
Certainly does mean
Oil prices increased.
But it's a slight increase, a threatened member.
That means if we take it.
We're looking at him now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to 2004.
And the rate of decline of the US dollar exceeded
Stupid exciting
Interacting with the weakening dollar
As the dollar falls, the price of oil rises.
This is also something the market has started to give its feeling to.
The focus now is on reducing.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the decline two years ago they were saying this and that, but the situation has changed now and things have emerged.
And the dollar began to lose value compared to other major currencies like the euro and sterling.
So the question is, why do you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency, not backed.
This is a historic age.
Gasoline and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
She says America in the mid-seventies.
He removed the yellow cover that was on the American dollar.
What is correct?
Sure, tell me what's correct.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share in the global market
Reaches 40%
Yesterday, when we said that the world consumes 85 million barrels
The one who deals with the dollar in oil pricing.
If you price in another currency, everyone will be confused.
You can't afford it.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states are hot heroes.
Those who own 66% of the world's stock are the big people.
Precautions, but I think of it as an export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all countries organized under OPEC
His market share does not exceed 40%.
Non-OPEC produced and exported
This ends and is not related to 40%.
He cannot by himself as long as
There are some countries that have tried but...
A realistic attempt?
This is the one who is rejected due to American involvement.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
Before a single barrel was fired
If they import that, it's a loss.
And his currency became very high.
And his sale of oil in dollars.
Upon his arrival or reception, he receives his money in dollars and then converts it to the local currency.
I made it independent of the dollar.
True, but
But this isn't your responsibility either; you sell for a dollar, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, then you have no problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar in light of the dollar's decline?
It has been interconnected for previous years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a strong currency with great purchasing power.
This abandonment is not easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here.
Divorce has costs.
That serves the interests of these countries and is not against them.
Profit and loss
Doha Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is a report by the Gulf Financial that says there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman left the Gulf currency authority.
I read a statement in the Wall Street Journal and I believe it's not a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been deported.
He said yes, and mentioned a study, but stated that all Gulf countries must...
Profit and loss should be analyzed carefully, apart from emotions.
Leave the matter for study until they come.
Live long, I can introduce you to other economists who offer another study.
This contradicts the study.
The Global Home Organization said something simple and organized and published a report on March 8th.
Just two weeks before that.
The global home identity is the simple solution, and requires a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
Who ends or the five with Kuwait, about the intention in 2010 to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to withdraw from the dollar.
Firstly, concerning the single currency.
From my personal perspective
To see the common currency of the United Gulf.
This real will be strong.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
And what will spread from the stock and the great income
That's why we, that's what the Prime Minister focused on when he said:
Gulf countries because no single nation can do it alone.
Unless it's a strong financial argument.
And today's economic growth, even to the euro, we see it.
Of course, don't forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In assessment
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all this news
A tense situation.
The observers were saying that the Global House stated that inflation would persist.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have reduced wages to 70% like the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflation process
And now my question is, when will you raise the wages of these poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short commercial break.
Today's Clip: Oil Inventory and Production of Gulf Countries, Saudi Arabia
Contains inventory worth $264 billion
Two out of ten barrels
Nine out of ten are made daily.
1 million, Kuwait 101 and a half, producing 1 billion, producing 2 and 7 out of 10 million.
Qatar with 15 and 12 billion produces 850,000, Oman with 5 and 6 out of 10 billion produces 707,000
Bahrain has 120 million and produces 30,000.
And an annual total revenue of 38 billion dinars.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and six billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the total domestic production of the countries in the Gulf region in 2006 was equal to 717
The total in 2007 is 799 and 7 out of 10 billion expected.
Because in 2008 and 912 and one of ten billion.
As inflation continues to eat away at workers' salaries and the earnings of those in this field.
But it will increase in 2008 to 8 out of 10.
Kuwait 14% but in 2008 it is expected to be 8 and 9 out of 10 in the UAE.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six and a half, and it will reach six.
And four out of ten
Salaries are being eaten up.
So, what amounts and percentages will you give to the poor people here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries always increase, salaries always increase.
It is not a solution.
I don't oppose raising wages.
What is true, I, what is true
We always celebrate.
Of course, there is faith.
The stance of raising, if inflation is not controlled, inflation will eat up all these increases.
To solve inflation, a committee comprising all experts and specialists.
And now this puts the committee in a difficult position.
Because wage increases in the world
And of course, the economic principle of gold says
It will not end.
Whichever
A significant increase in wages, no matter how much the raise is.
The altitude will shift.
The solution is required, and for that reason.
A scientific study by Bayt.com, a specialized recruitment institute, was conducted with the assistance of Yogi from the UK, Siraj.
They conducted an assessment of 15,000 employees working in Gulf countries across 20 key sectors.
Especially experts and those with a profession there do not find job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to eat away.
Especially those with experience.
We are considering moving from countries where inflation continues to take its toll.
Now you will lose
This is a simple concept, do it and try to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase wages.
The balance is available.
Here
We are stressed and the state is stressed, and we are trying our best.
Solve this question with a real solution.
Temporary solutions do not solve the problem but rather exacerbate its impact.
Increase in meaning
We hope to get more time so that this committee can be established.
All requests
This is my toil and my pride.
Boredom will always remain.
True, but the government attempted and designed the increases at 40%.
No, here's an important point regarding salary increases.
Regarding the increase, they only want Qatari citizens, as if non-Qatari workers are working in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
Readers are counted, newcomers are despised.
While the highest rate is in that
Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about it and suffering.
Much higher rewards than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we used to see
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector has become...
Because the best units and capabilities have started.
As I read a report, as you know, we are in an oil field.
From work
As if our experts
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these matters, what is the rate of increase in wages?
Hopes are with the great God, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
The best temporary solution.
And we will have a vision and I will be sure.
That there is
Positive results
It will be at the edge of 15%.
Sure, the second good report says that 22 billion barrels of oil will be transferred to you and 43 billion cubic meters of gas.
No notes, not the irrigation process.
The procedure and of course we
But talking about economic growth must also include people.
Reflecting any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And its counterpart
A lot of the "transportation" in the country is part of
And if the existence of these two "large transports" and large projects did not exist.
In this country, it won't be part of the inflation either.
Led to some inflation
This also led to a significant flow of money into the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
They sold oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, thus stability in power.
Thank you.
Saoud Al-Ghamdi is from the Sudayri tribe, your question is about Saud.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Frankly, it's a good series and a good name.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under U.S. policies.
American policy in its current war, alongside the cultural war it seeks to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
America's inability reached Japan with $61 billion.
Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America, there are nine equivalents.
Billions, while now invested with the European Union worth over twenty-seven billion dollars
Maintaining US policy and making the dollar a compulsory commodity for the world as a whole.
Brother, I say buy now.
And the Gulf region will become
As it should be.
Thank you, Brother Saad
Muhammad al-Waseef from Egypt
Hello, Your Excellency, the Counselor participating with you.
Middle Eastern Arab rulers, your highnesses, remind me of...
When it is
When claims for price adjustments are made
Adjust wages according to prices, as you said, Your Excellency.
In Qatar, we considered you a role model.
And work on not committing to lifting, this is the Arab pattern.
We want to consider the sector as a whole.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Certainly it's his right; he is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His uncle defines him by consideration.
This is one second that public opinion must respond to.
With the poor, as you said, because they are the people in countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and peace be upon your master.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and beautiful, this is good.
Sure, thank you for paying attention to the issue we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will remain so, God willing. We know and trust that there are no poor people in Qatar.
And the judge affirmed that the money goes to the ruling family and to the informant, as he stated.
That's the important question now.
First, we bring the siblings.
It cannot be evaluated.
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities like Al-Shaqab, Lusail, and other places, meaning Qatar is expanding.
This is not correct, the case is
Suitable civil plan
Simply, because we still have two minutes, tell us what the train will do?
The country now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because
Non-renewable resource
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, the trend of the state in Qatar today.
The capital in the Middle East in education.
Yesterday we saw the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best departments in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today it's oil and gas.
No, of course, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
It's not just the island, you'll get a hundred islands, and of course we reject the island.
Because my brothers, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the seventies, things changed. Now everyone remembers that the seventies changed.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
That requires a special series about a train in the post-oil era.
Within our vision regarding oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. Finally, I send my best regards to the teams organizing the program.
I am Ahmed Mansoor, and I am calling you from outside the country. Peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings from God be upon you.
Hello, we bring you this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Military Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders have special relations with Qatar's leadership.
The Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the areas in South Beirut that were destroyed by Israel during the summer of the 2006 Lebanon War?
And so far, unlimited support to rebuild what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And when Qatar renegotiated
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia two years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
As in the Lebanon file, he succeeded where others failed.
To gather Lebanon's leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that secured their safety.
To the final elections
Also difficult files
The one who cared about being the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
And today in our clip
We try to understand the foundation and principles from which Qatar's foreign policy began.
And among its benefits
Qatar, the smallest in area and population, plays these significant roles.
And what are the conditions that allow him to do that?
And that will be through a direct conversation with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
And whoever wishes to join us can contact us through the numbers of the deliverer, which will be displayed on the screen in the future.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's voice: Weapons are being deployed to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like the attempt of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to occupy the government of Qatar with the help of the Al-Marri tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Kind.
Many things are unknown.
What I believe is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I've always said that accuracy is the thing.
And consider him the main member.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
In addition,
Different points of view
The truth is that the issue of borders has been resolved, and it was a major obstacle.
The historical ties between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were special.
If we see these relations
Between the two countries and their families
Affected by the misunderstanding
Neither us nor others
Because there are no conditions between siblings.
And it's done and now the relationship is in a state that confirms it is excellent.
Under the cooperation of the Cooperation Council
But how did the situation improve between Qatar and Saudi Arabia when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason for the crisis in 2002?
There is an important point.
I repeat that if you went back to all the programs, I always said
We are not limited to the eldest sister, but I was saying that our reliance is on the Cooperation Council.
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with him.
There was some heated exchange in the media, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries renew themselves.
Cease isolating yourself from the community.
Saudi-Qatari Home Special
Thus, they found themselves in conflict.
Where there is no cow.
And I believe that this is not a strategy for anyone who was in this conflict.
But I apologize, Sheikh, I am allowed to put things in their context or dot the i's.
It is noticeable that a jewel has been in the last few years.
At a time when the circumstances you criticized on Al Jazeera screen are still ongoing.
What is happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Are the detainees, opponents, or others still resilient?
Giza stopped dealing with these matters.
Qatar Radio's Hajj coverage turned into
Praising the system and what it does, maintaining the two holy mosques at different times.
First, you can request the Gezira administration about this matter, don't ask me because I
What connects the two countries.
To settle in the area
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
As the call of the Governor of Kuwait's Holy Mosques
It affected every deaf person and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about settling, resolving, and burying Arab differences.
Not just in terms of vision
No, it's in politics, and politics is a matter of opinion.
Considered in the Arab world
A kind of war
While in the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
Now I've stayed for many years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this topic and the other one.
The concept of a small state confronting large nations and making them feel weak.
Every difference or misunderstanding.
She has her reasons.
And its causes are above.
Due to the wisdom of our Alawi leaders.
Are there insurances for future relationships?
Creatures between two extremes
Based on love, brotherhood, and the benefits that bind the two countries.
And the Muslims, their word is considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We have high hopes for this relationship between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to grow.
For the better, and there will be more spaces.
This relationship is similar to what we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Because it's a train of a major country.
Sure, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because what is bad is that at the same time it reached out to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera Channel
"Are you against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab state?"
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian people.
And from it is dependent a dependent.
For many reasons, the Arab world and the Egyptian people are victims.
And this is the situation.
It is believed that we are trying through this case to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
According to what you say, Egypt and the Egyptian people are respected.
I believe he is a good person.
The difference between us and Egypt lies in two points.
Or a single point.
We are accused of planning to replace Gaza, and I don't believe it.
And we do not intend it.
In cases concerning other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is an opportunity for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in those destroyed by Hamas against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny it. In fact, we didn't know it this way like other media experts.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or caused disagreement between you both in this context?
I will come to this.
Hezbollah's plan
Hezbollah and
But I'm talking about my country.
We were completely astonished by this matter.
I stand with Qatar.
What the buildings said.
The pyramid, we said.
To launch an attack on Egypt and occupy it.
Can I reply?
We return to the embezzlement they mentioned.
The days will reveal this.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I acquit the Egyptian people and their president, Hosni Mubarak, of that.
If we return to the Alma conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the summit held in Doha?
And it was a coincidence, and when the conference was to be held with us
They said we didn't want to hold the conference.
People, we know that you are cooperating with Israel.
To Qatar, and this is it.
What we're trying to understand is the cause.
We sat and talked, and talking is always good.
It contains two parts.
Who are they?
There is a disagreement.
In the political direction
If we look at the puzzle conference that was held
Mr. Amir spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
And we were informed by a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have an opinion on the matter that is best not taken.
People disperse at a time when we see them.
If you don't want to hold it in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab Union State.
And it will be harmful to discuss the issue at the Kuwait Conference by playing.
What is happening is viewed by Israel and the Western world.
When we all said, "Surely," this has now become common, and there is no power or strength except in God, and the Arabs cannot stop this, nor can any great nation stop this battle.
Egypt's request to halt the conflict in Gaza was followed by an end to the fighting within an hour.
So even our parents
We should not take the Arab street for granted. Our opposing stance towards the brothers is limited to one point.
This is in accordance with international standards.
And hospitals and doctors are insufficient at the borders.
You were the ones who used to stand at the border.
Here and no one has entered.
Brotherhood is not something we should take for granted.
Because it borders Egypt and is considered part of national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect the leadership in Egypt.
And we know his position, but this does not harm Egypt's position.
And our hope is great from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
I believe that we can transmit our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue operation after Gaza
That the Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza
Either you are a conference that provides, implements, and considers it assistance to the government.
We were not invited to the conference; she was invited to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
It's as if we are gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be released to any party.
Thus it will spread to
People affected in Gaza
Directly and this was
Because entry is prohibited from every side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Victory in the political affairs of the Emirates is of great importance to us.
But you're waiting.
Just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers was venting about what had been rejected, saying...
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his hand.
Frankly, I think this official belittled his country.
Frankly, they didn't fail and they didn't talk about anything but themselves.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has a mind in this matter.
To close matters in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king decides that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for those who say we stopped them, that is a violation of those we stopped.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
The limit has been reached.
He thinks he should impose his strength.
We apologize for this.
If you think a small state has no right, its rights are excluded from that right.
And as you enter and try to disturb Darfur
This is an Arabic decision in the Arab Clubs League.
Africa's decisions and United Nations resolutions
I think the fundamental problem is
The plan orchestrated by Hezbollah along with Qatar
A plan of someone I don't know in Qatar.
If it happens, likely after the swine flu, it has appeared somewhere in Qatar, it will be the cause of the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country; learn about its size and specifications.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a specific policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it a happiness.
Because any Arab disagreement
We believe that any Arab disagreement can weaken our position on our core issues, namely Palestine and all the other files we face.
The Arab world became a receiver.
Even our analysis has become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know about him, we know what happened in Pakistan.
He wants to receive me and organize the color warehouse in Washington for me.
Is Qatar being punished?
Has Qatar done any harm to an Arab state?
Try to contribute money.
These contributors are controversial.
I'm going through the process of saying "peace be upon you," and you're improving by saying "you're saying hello to attract me."
This is another case, meaning you have a problem or a deficiency.
This case doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always tell him.
Especially after the speech of King Abdullah, the custodian of the holy mosques.
In Kuwait and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks his mind.
My heart is troubled; I say this always.
I always say this.
I always say that even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I was saying that I
And you can return to all the documents you have on the island but
The situation is different, no, no.
From one part, we said no, this is everything, let's stop at this point.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
To understand their issues and where their mistakes lie
And if we see our mistakes, that doesn't mean everything we have is correct.
Are you referring to this, sir?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that the sector contributes in any way to planning against Egypt externally and works to undermine its relations with Turkey and other countries?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are twenty-seven million if we can, not ninety million.
They are a problem that needs a solution.
You contributed to the Shalit soldier case despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you requested with the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
That there is an issue we need to address, we said to our brothers, this matter concerns the Egyptians, they said.
We want to look at this case as a request.
From Israel and another state, we want to see another part to make sure of this.
When we saw this, we told them that the same conditions apply for brothers to speak to brothers in Egypt.
And having declared this, I mean, is there any official person who can say that we have hidden the Arab union in this sense?
This means he is a decision-maker.
How did he manage to do that despite his illness?
Allowing President Mahmoud Abbas to stay.
We endorsed this.
Is he speaking to his people? Is he speaking to us? Is he speaking to the Arab world?
The issue is with you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island as claimed.
And the island deserves the smoke of competition from the media of the group as it is in the medium group.
There are a large number of media outlets, and when they reach adulthood, they curse at each other.
But after a while, you'll reach a stage of maturity.
It may be or it may not be.
First, our position on Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we acknowledge that we are in Qatar.
An important relationship.
Saudi Arabia is an important country, but there is a discrepancy in the relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a peculiarity between Egypt and another Arab country, as Egypt is the largest Arab state.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia, and our relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the president of Egypt.
I wish it were limited to a disagreement in policies from two perspectives.
I told you about the problem during the attack on Gaza.
The second issue is that they are facing problems with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar did to deserve this problem.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the President of Egypt and the President of the United States now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And he was open to the scripture, so they said at first that he was sought after, but we found him the next morning.
There is a meeting between me and Omar Salama.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable separation.
And I can't say that we agree on everything.
Let's say that, so no one interprets it as if you're comparing yourself.
But respect is respect, whether it's towards the young or the old.
The minister said that Egypt is obtaining proper satisfaction.
Satisfaction among children
I don't think Egypt is bigger than this, I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to resolve the issues with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
I beg you, I don't want to talk about divine intervention, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I call
One of the misleaders claims that there is a way.
And our pride in Egypt
That there is a specific way.
He will be with me or against me.
And any suffering felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we suffer with it, and here it is, the policy of our master, the prince.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power from China, sources of power from France, and a source of power from a small country like Qatar.
Our security is in God.
which shows that
Try to do it.
But we are a small country, and I will keep that in mind.
And I repeat it a hundred times.
For no one would say that we have any feeling.
That no one takes from us
To Israel, you are now named.
Sure, before I go to Israel.
How do you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, if I can tell you about the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us according to their interests, and so do we.
All complaints and all of them.
To weaken the relationship
I think any large country doing that would affect its image.
It will also affect our pride in Arabic if we teach each other in English.
Everything comes to us and we know everything.
Our solution is based on the interests of the Arabs.
He's here for them if they need anything.
Are there steps that follow to repair relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If there's someone delivering the beds.
He will find himself losing to the alliance of the two countries and their leadership.
No, it could be tomorrow, it could be in ten years, I believe that I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone invites us to a conference, we attend it, and if we have an opinion, we express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our older sister, but we have our own perspectives and discuss things together.
All that is needed every time you come is that we will have great happiness.
which were canceled due to this policy
As I said, we respect the people of Egypt.
Of course, you wonder about the number of contracts that were cancelled, so ask about the number of Egyptian residents who arrived in Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
On June 4th of last year, it stirred the feelings of Arab states when it closed the Israeli office, and it was published in Arutz on June 4th.
Why do you say we took them? If we wanted to take them, we wouldn't have been keeping them locked up for ten years.
When each of them had its own campaign before reaching a settlement with Israel and before secret meetings began between Arab states and Israel
And after the settlement between most Arabs
With Israel, whether it's under the table, on the table, or talking to it in any way.
If we want to activate emotions, we must activate them in previous Islamic conferences.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally had hosted a dinner for Israel's Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of many guests who attended this dinner, and I don't know why the ambassador arranged this dinner.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny this.
Or we find a pulse of hope to overcome the suffering endured by our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed and I got a small space to benefit from Egypt, but unfortunately
What was mine, is now yours.
I will ask a question about the United States and the new administration's authority and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military headquarters in Qatar.
Views differ.
Versatile in solving many cases in the region.
And if they are generous, we will help them to the best of our ability.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that were between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Qatari emir spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran, even though its relations with the United States are bad.
First, we must put it in the context of internal affairs, as we need to respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the establishment of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you see the agreement as still consistent, or will a new agreement be needed?
The Doha Accord was for a phase in which it would work on holding peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day, moment by moment, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened at one of the polling centers to clarify some misunderstandings.
But you still have something to do in the arrangements in Lebanon.
We stay close to Lebanon, you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and work there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Question from Wardia: Answer about what is happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi affair, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or your interventions put them in front of the state, and currently there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the South.
We were affected by many factors, which means this is the reason we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
It is true that we faced great pressure, but this was our vision and represented His Highness's position.
The topic of the Huthayn.
The impact of stability on us is positive, and the impact of instability on us is negative.
We intervened in a fair settlement between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's meant for other purposes.
And He was with them, and He will remain with them in all their circumstances.
It is not based on a fact.
I see that we have no need.
We sell it.
I say this in defense because I know there is a large Arab audience who disagree with me.
Dear viewers, thank you for listening. We hope we have clarified some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy.
To conclude, a greeting from the program team, and here is Ahmed Mansour taking you across borders.
In the name of God, and peace and blessings be upon all who deserve them.
Peace be upon you and welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say a special and unique interview? Because it is
Qatar and this man's wealth was the primary financier.
Walk, a simple and clear question.
I believe this happened due to an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when you went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and Lebanon being managed from both sides was important.
To achieve results
It is very important that external powers intervene.
Many opinions and suggestions come from outside.
Lebanese and International Arabic if you want to say it that way.
Stages passed, but they meant something.
It is nothing but that these stages existed.
Does that mean the complications are in Lebanon?
From the Time of Truth
I mean when I collected and entered directly now on the Lebanon line and registered Lebanon.
Did you find the Lebanese complex big?
The international and regional Lebanese that needs a broad interpretation
Is it a simple matter that has been complicated by outside interference?
Because we know that Lebanon is a star of the press, a star of culture, a star of tourism, and a star of many things.
Lebanese should not be allowed.
To achieve peace and security in Lebanon
The first issue
External results in Lebanon
You decided to surprise everyone after 24 hours by transferring them all on one plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Qatari president.
They were never expected, they couldn't rest for a minute unless you were interested in letting them.
The secret is not to let them rest and think too much.
Make many calls.
We propose relocating them to Doha because we need an environment.
Or you will face many obstacles.
And in many circumstances
We transfer them from these states to states where you will find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly
God made us succeed by the Beirut Declaration or the Fifty Statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The party agreed to go to Doha.
Many people believed that Qatar leaned more towards one side than the other.
And I'm from Beirut.
His policy is that we are intermediaries.
In this process
Sure, Frankly
Do you discern the truth?
with at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And showed his support for the plan.
I benefited from Saeed's life that we
All people need a solution.
His reasons are weak.
If you rely on logic
His reasons are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
There is an Iranian nuclear case.
The Arab League must possess a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
And organize meetings to find solutions, why can't the Arabs with ancient roots do that?
Uniting the Arabs, or gathering the factions, is necessary to intervene in support of the oppressed.
It must be studied.
If we want to get a notification for the Arab League, not for the Arab League for the Arab World.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the assistants was here, President Nabih Berri.
He needs S-S.
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
Frankly, listen to us.
And their height is like the height of Qatar.
It did not lead to a result on any given day.
In the interest of Arab interests.
It will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations, when I went to agree in Doha.
Projects prepared for solutions, not for other reasons.
Undoubtedly
The most important role in the entire Arab world.
To enter
Stop it by our agreement.
Others will come and help us.
Because this is a dangerous matter.
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our backyard?
In our garden
It is very important that we put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab league after this agreement to figure out what to do with our Palestinian brothers.
What can we do for Somalia?
What we do for Somalia, is it part of the Arab cycle?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we give it a try?
We are part of the Arab world, and we are a small part of this world.
I hope this won't be suggesting an idea.
Qatar maintains good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think the first thing is to do what we can, even if nothing is asked of us.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
Saudi Kingdom, its king
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically there was an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria.
It could just be a temporary phase.
And it will be with God's will.
Since I insist on asking, is that okay with you? Could you possibly play a role in this scene?
Even if it's not public yet, you have a kind of confidence.
Any rapprochement between Arab states are we seeking?
And that was his policy from the start, but this matter...
What happened in Lebanon indicates that the region is on the verge of major changes.
Or what happened in Lebanon is local matters and not a regional issue.
Not related to this situation.
I wish the opposite, I wish this were true.
Start a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, sir, are you concerned that the escalation seen some time ago
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There is no doubt that I still care about Palestine, now the issue of Gaza.
I want to ask
We don't need anything else.
I request that the human aspect in Palestine be taken care of.
We can't give them the medicine.
Or food.
Electricity for patients in the hospital.
What dies when the power goes out?
I want
The Arab Union States agree on an amount for this matter of food and medicine, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want this to be presented to the Red Crescent.
It is carried by the broad red one.
But please, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to belabor the point, I'm just saying that as Arabs, we should provide medicine and food even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded with great effort and a key was hung on the sacred Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
Saying that you don't deal with this party because we will find you a solution is not correct.
And I
So far, I have no clues to the solution.
Are you concerned about an American-Iranian rapprochement in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important ally of ours.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want to be connected or associated with Israel.
Perhaps some think you're necessarily part of that due to the American bases there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
He may meet, be consulted, or speak with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say that this was an accidental incident.
The second subject was that Saudi Arabia wanted to find a solution, and I was interviewed with Prince Saeed.
What happened in the last few hours.
Changing the strategy, changing negotiation strategies.
From your part or other parts
We are responsible for
And from all sides, we locked ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... Then his excellency's intervention was very important.
And one of them is intervention work.
Without mentioning it, it's over now.
And his message was clear when he said: "We know our size, our place, our role, and so on, as if it were..."
He wanted to take a role without provoking any other party.
Either Arab, or national, or rational.
But even if
I became responsible.
Did you want it or not?
We're trying to prevent some anger because we're a nation.
that these countries
I can do or
I believe this will be the profitable availability.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term, regular, or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It doesn't mean we don't have different views in cases.
But this is our right if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good it is, how do you interpret that on earth?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Just like health, but if we're talking about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and clarify it in the next stage.
In my opinion, we are leaving the conflict with Israel from our side.
And if we wanted, the theater would stop in the Arab court.
And resolving the dispute between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective
Thank you for your dear follow-up, and we will meet again as God wills. I wish you all the best.
Welcome to our followers in this conversation with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We try to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their efforts.
Welcome, Mr. Sheikh.
To study what is happening in Gaza
And I want through this dialogue that we are able
Some of your questions light up.
The Israeli incursion into Gaza in a horrifying manner.
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
And their consistent countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance that represents the Arab states?
And then, we find settlement areas.
From our position, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an accusatory manner.
And no one was punished during
We are punished for everything, whether intentional or unintentional.
We are the specialized people.
In the world and one of those always targeted
Always consistent in manner.
I think
To the extent that we cannot
Coordination at the leadership level
To stop the teaching campaign
We didn't want to create a gap in the Arab world.
And there were five more endorsements by speech.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They want what is correct to be wrong and our view to be incorrect because of the goal.
The goal is to solve the problem, not to hold a summit.
But will the solution come at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What I am requesting now is that Qatar's request not be canceled by the ministry.
And it was also confirmed by His Excellency.
In the speech he delivered, we do not insist on holding the summit in Qatar if it leads to any tension, nor do we insist on holding the summit in Qatar; it can be held anywhere.
An Arab stance that is respected by others.
Yes, and that minister.
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He did not participate in making the decision, and continued in the Gaza Strip with killing and explosions, and still does so.
And I need to ask the Arabs what we will do about it.
What are we doing?
Will that be when Israel ends?
To implement the remaining Security Council resolution
Or a stance will spread because Israel did not stop.
Launch, we do not force our brothers.
To a decision that is seen as ongoing
A few days ago
We will talk about the meeting of the two ministers.
You will end up supporting this.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and we have been considering it. Some other countries, including Syria and Yemen, have also requested the summit.
Undoubtedly, an Arab gap already exists.
Or divide us into the balance camp.
And the area of imbalance
And what do they mean by "the adjusted"?
That was arranged by the West.
Named Arabs and Unnamed Arabs
You will not find a moderate state or a non-moderate state.
And I want to know what is moderate and what is not moderate, what does moderate mean? Following Israel's plans?
The case ends in an important manner.
Or we just need to open the case.
I mean, this is an important question.
What are the countries?
The following are Israel's plans and attempts to solve problems in a certain way.
I don't want to say that they follow Israel's agenda, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If you invite us to a state of equilibrium.
What is balance in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree to kill a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections were held.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a position that exists.
The current reality is that there are
Concept
What some people call an extreme movement
But we need to ask ourselves, what does this initiative demand?
Is she asking for something beyond her rights, or is she demanding her rights?
Or do we divide them?
And created other masses as well.
Against because we
Internal, Arabic, and intellectual
And he began to speak.
That's why we don't want to fight a war for others.
Yes, Madam, the Sheikh simply said.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say it happened; there were some efforts, and the topics were partially known.
Field of prevention
But as I said, we could have done it.
Choose and get two-thirds.
But this was not the goal because it's not a matter of challenge, but rather a matter of urgent need, that's what we believe.
While others considered it not to be an urgent need.
We went to the security agency.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the security establishment, and Israel said it would enable it and then look into the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert effort to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What sets it apart from the first meeting?
In interactions, contradictions sometimes occur.
As enough
Will we be ready to prepare for a clear Arab platform?
Humanitarian aid
Great support for our brother
Also addressed to the Israeli team and informed them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, let's assume we're reviewing this matter.
Why don't we assemble it?
Forty and four, and we are committed to the truce. Forty and four, and the Israelis have not complied.
It is common for competitions to occur at meetings, but in reality, these competitions
It represents their circumstances and what is in their hearts.
One of the conflicts that were reported.
That there is a person who described Hamas' movement as a split.
Or even a little
This situation occurred and we responded to it, and my brother's presence among the ministers.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are radical movements, disintegrating, and in other words.
We are not the others, nor are the others us.
And so it always means, I don't mean any particular person by that.
Any foreigners found are to be deported.
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
Among the Arabs
Sure, Sir.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
His agenda must be one thing.
Where are your Arab relatives in all this, and what is the stance of a hundred and thirty people?
One million Israelis openly
Issued after the decision of 1600.
The issued decision.
Israel has not implemented that, it will implement it after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
Who should be thanked for this decision.
To demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And if they are asked, they will say, "We know them."
It is not considered a mistake for Arabs if they...
If this is the case, Israel cannot be blamed.
He is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the top, the security council will work for us.
He needs to make a tough decision.
Decisions are made.
An employee may lose his position.
We were afraid of the West.
And they expect us to work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to stray from the topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq entirely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
We don't ask the Iraqi government, and we don't ask the people who were killed.
No compensation.
The same thing in Sudan when they started talking about Bashir's trial.
Your emptiness
Your emptiness, Sheikh.
A major diplomatic victory for Iraq in the Security Council.
Listen, there were some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Results
Israel did not commit to that.
It will be adhered to in two days, in a week, after the mission is completed.
Because they didn't match him.
Sorry, but people have to gather.
Because Israel agreed after completing its important task.
Do you have an alternative to your decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, work against each other.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am friendly with the West, and I don't mind having any relations with the West, and I am not
Anti-West, not anti-America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have an opinion.
Finally, they will move to one percent from our perspective and we say we won.
What is victory?
Including its contents
I can't say anything about caution now because the decision hasn't been made.
And the council is its own master.
You participated in shaping it.
Yes, we participated in shaping it to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went are enough.
She pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
Regarding this, my lord.
For two years up to this moment
Listen, I don't want to talk about allegations.
I cannot hide that we were provided with all the details.
If they are people
There was an Israeli rejection, an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there, the caliphate began and the siege started.
And at the end of last month, Israel killed 28 Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And He humbled them in death, so that they might seek help, but there was no one to help them.
These limbs are your master, O Sheikh.
Clarify the Palestinian dispute clearly.
I mean, if it existed.
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
Unless you say to one party: No, you are 100% truthful.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I neither claim that nor say it.
But reality is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And it was not only the affiliated, but all of us like the Arabs are deserving of everyone who works.
But we don't want it to exist, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Once train troops from the right and left.
And once again by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And if we establish a positive model in the West Bank
To give people in Gaza a glimpse of how people live.
Luxurious life
While in the opposite direction in Gaza
I was invited to a second ministerial meeting or an Arab ministerial meeting, but at this moment.
What talks are still ongoing between Hamas through Turkey?
This meeting that I invited you to attend suggests that he is trying to avoid it.
It would be evasive if we were to start a new initiative.
We don't have initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We are asked to participate and support any effort made by Egypt to reach an understanding.
But it's important.
Do not come.
Yesterday's election results show that he won over another party.
No path to balance.
Parallel initiative from Egypt
Between international demand, Arab demand, and human demand.
The requirements for Egypt's role are of great importance.
This is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
Is this what is asked of Egypt?
The current proposal, the current initiative, does not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the idea.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't say anything about something I didn't know.
With all due respect to the government or the presidency of Palestine, which should exist, and we all realize the presidency of Palestine.
But there are people as well.
Those who are hurt on another side, we must also take their perspective.
Because we produce these intermediate works.
Since you want it, to take the viewpoint.
Hamás' positions were clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into consideration, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in shaping without contacting or consulting the main party concerned with the issue.
We only want, of course, to deal with the State of Palestine as a state.
And we deal with power as a unilaterally defined concept.
But now there is a distinction between a group in one place and another group in another place.
This does not mean that if we collaborate with people from Gaza, we have to stop cooperating with those in the bank or the Bahrain presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask a person from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced in this context
First, regarding the decision, he did not mention a mechanism, but praised the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some consider it a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from my reading of this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in its implementation.
He who stops the fight.
I have no doubt about our brother in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this resolution to be non-existent because Israel did not accept it.
Even if accepted later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, His Excellency the Sheikh is eloquent in discussing Egypt's efforts.
Cooperating with Turkey's efforts at the same time and we want
Or an Arabic justification.
Or the Arab disputes that they failed to resolve, and thus left a vacuum to be filled.
Supposed to be filled by Arab parties
I welcome the Turkey platform.
A stance that should be appreciated by Arabs and their allies.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people follow him.
There is no Arab consciousness that can solve the problem.
They will say, "Let them complete the task."
There must be a clear Arab stance, a clear stance against all this aggression, and it must be sustained and unwavering.
That there is an opposite Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision. I'm not talking about a war between Israel and the Arabs, but rather our people who always call for peace.
And we are a nation that loves to live in peace.
But I'm not calling for an Arab war, I'm calling for
A clear stance from the Arabs.
In the context of initiatives and proposals, you follow what is happening.
and the specific proposals and conditions set by Hamas
You think?
Now as an observer on the ground
And the military intervention's achievement now will allow Hamas to set its conditions.
Does it have to be true?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
I don't know about this negotiation, because I told you they weren't there. Ah, now they're negotiating.
The second thing
Sure, in the required places for Arabs.
This Arab reality
What we witnessed after the start of those operations.
It seems that an advanced position is being taken by the Arab street.
As governments, we have a responsibility to act.
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe the people's gift as...
They tell me about this question again.
Represents the opinion of the people.
The presidents now.
I mean, if they wanted them.
At least he sees her.
Of course, there is a high demand and a moderate demand.
To end normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar for
Closing the Israeli representative office in Doha
Qatar, which takes this position.
They argued that the Arab side should be definitive and show clear positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
There would never be if there were an Arab agreement.
A covenant is one thing, and relationships are another.
We're ready.
Going with our Arab brothers
If only there was a clear Arab decision and trust.
And they treat others, not just countries with which they have relations, ...
But also countries that do not own them.
This is very important.
Don't become representatives for others.
He says: Why doesn't Qatar become an example in this field?
If this is the only model, we are ready to join it.
But we also want
An Arab model, Qatar is committed to part of its Arab commitment.
As
And no one should sell themselves to another.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret, I don't want to mention the heirs.
That's why it's very important.
No formal invitations anywhere because we need to rise above this.
Some called the ambassador, others organized protests, and some expelled the ambassador like Chavez.
It's part of the dispute.
But some requested the ambassador and invited the permanent member states, all of them films about our people.
We talked about the limited ceiling of people's requests.
Since the high expectations, there are those who demand the opening of fronts, and there are those who demand that Syria open fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
"And we do not differ concerning Israel."
Fighting with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
That make us talk to each other and improve our contradictions.
What I said, my lord, she sent it to me as a message.
On condition that countries do not sell each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The streets won't forgive us.
Your emptiness, Sheikh.
Is what's happening today the achievement of a project that started in 2006 in the Lebanon War?
Or there is a contradiction.
No, I think there are contradictions in the goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
Since some parts are supposed to be in stock for the United Nations.
Or something similar
Lebanon, I mean that we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel needs weak, tailored, tailored, tailored cases for action.
That's why he dominates and is the master with the upper hand.
Of course there are countries supporting them and they are foreigners.
That's why he wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To repeat this example in Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And how many sides does it have?
While in Palestine, there is only one party.
But I assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they have heard too much from many Arabs and strangers.
And this is where the divide began, each one thinking they would control the other part.
In your opinion, as an observer and watchful person
As planned, it will end in a bone collapse.
We accept this as an Arab nation because it may be returned to those who disagree with it.
Or express his opinion.
Either they will be Israelis or others in the future.
We set a high example.
Compliance and assistance in bone breaking
We have a moral example that says: I and my brother against my brothers; I, my brother, and my brothers against others.
Now let's assume any contradiction with Hamas, and I'm not saying Hamas or any other party cannot make any mistakes.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must finish this matter.
The humblest part of his legs
Because failure here will not be a failure of the group.
Khaled, Sheikh Qataa', usually when I mean a previous period, was trying to prepare proposals.
Initiatives to offer solutions took place in Lebanon.
It happened in Darfur, we'll talk about this later, even if briefly.
What we are
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are some sensitivities.
One who presents this challenge from a single country, we do not count him, as long as there is a solution.
The goal now is not to put Qatar in the lead.
It was not one of his Highness's goals.
One of his goals was how to stop the bleeding.
And learn governance.
What happened is beyond imagination.
He is in Qatar.
Do we know anything they didn't know? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To achieve a solution to offer a commitment
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative concerning the Justice and Equality Movement in Darfur has achieved.
And the government of Sudan in Khartoum.
And the main subject will be about solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem, in its inception,
"Help" in Arabic
But we do not harness a reason we said was universal.
Based on the regime's aggression, we currently want to solve the problem but don't know how.
And whenever we want to implement decisions, we always strive, as you mentioned earlier, because we are the best implementers of decisions.
The status is removed from competition, is there also competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we conclude the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held, will you attend it?
No, we'll be at the summit.
We want it to be held in an environment different from the Arab environment, but it was planned.
It will be an insult.
Surely, if the Arab leaders attended this summit, ...
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they gathered for financial and economic reasons.
Help with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances, of course I hope nothing happens to our people, but safety first.
And to make sure
But no one takes anyone in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, many thanks.
Peace be upon you, viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So how realistic is this event and the truthfulness of the announcements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most ignored in the world.
What about our Arab family region, and how much are they interested in this topic?
These and other questions will be put to our guest today on today's show.
Former Special Adviser to the UN Conference on Disabilities
And you get a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Social Sciences from Qatar University.
A Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt.
He held a number of positions in the field of disabilities.
I am one of its founding members and the chairperson of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In 1989
And a member of the National Committee for Disability since 2000
Until 2003
He contributed to the establishment of the Shaallah Center for the Disabled.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
I oversaw the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
He contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Ms. Hissa, welcome to this segment.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we named the victims perhaps in the 1980s and before that.
A more educational concept when
Who are these people to whom this education is being provided?
An important document at the United Nations appeared in '93.
Translate the term and before we go into details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries and are classified as poor countries.
And Latin America in particular, in fact, this trend there is stronger than in any other region.
But the numbers proved that this was not true.
The trend towards legal rights is present in the Arab world and has been found in many countries.
It may be possible that resources exist and there is also a political will.
Sure, ask me to tell you some statistics that you might know.
Forty percent of poor countries
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with disabilities from poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Hessa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
This is largely true.
I have seen in Darfur, Gaza, and areas prone to incidents such as wars and conflicts.
Here, it's impossible to distinguish between the infected and the healthy because they are numerous.
In fact, the number of children suffering from reading and writing retardation among girls, for example, is approximately fifty-five or fifty-five.
And other countries
There are many barriers that prevent the children in this group from going to school, even if they do not have disabilities.
In fact, the city has no infrastructure, even if this child found the school.
Cannot access it.
For the children and other residents
These programs and projects are large, but we hear little about them.
However, we are talking about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which was celebrated worldwide just a few days ago. What is the purpose of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people who do not have disabilities.
Creatures arrived and embarked on many projects.
Implementing a very important health plan.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and the work of marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a level of awareness in the Arab world, and it is considered better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and end our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I want to ask, because she has been to the United Nations before.
The second point
The laws adopted by the United Nations calling for confrontation with regimes that hinder society, for example, the Syrian intelligence system, which is now a child's play.
Is there a law allowing for the prosecution of the regime, as exists in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you, dear friends.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If possible, I am one of those who suffer from psychological and cognitive self-disabilities.
Listen to the Arabs, it is said that a free man understands by signs.
And it is a sign in the Quran that says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," that Allah is glorified by everything, and everything glorifies Him.
I lived for thirty years without saying a single word or two every day.
Therefore submit to God. You have heard Him.
I was referring to the Quran and found...
People who attack me because I use the Quran as a source and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without knowing they're at the bottom of hell.
I've just been abused.
And he does not speak the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And it is their nature to have psychological disabilities.
Regarding my brother Suleiman's inquiry, it falls within the definition itself.
UN programs or responses to the causes of disabilities such as political or other goals
Go to various agencies and institutions.
Talking to them, motivating them, and understanding to some extent.
Creatures and states of disabilities are on their agenda.
The World Confederation of Cultures, the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, and indeed these organizations have already taken the disabilities status into account.
This is one of the programs that aim to care for children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and schools.
From different environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there is a shortage; we need to acknowledge that there is also a shortage in the United Nations.
What is the weakness and outstanding competence you mentioned?
UNESCO
The issue of routine and protocol
I was in the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
Practical especially at times during restrictions or shortages.
Conflict or attempting to confront people with disabilities for recognition.
Until you reach very acceptable, unless you put it in a separate article as the Global Disability Movement wanted.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no cooperation between them.
This is one of his most prominent flaws.
Survey, implemented by the Special Advisor and applied to countries.
Among the employees or people working on those programs
Undoubtedly, we have only received three responses out of forty-eight from organizations and agencies, and only three responses reached me.
Do not put.
The issue of disabilities is ongoing, persistent, and stable for many years, although this issue is first and foremost a human rights issue.
Recently, alhamdulillah, two or three years ago.
The issue of obstacles has at least been raised through events such as conferences and other occasions.
Peace be upon you
The polite lady, why are there no binding laws or decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international principles?
For the countries of the Arab world and the classification of salaries, for example, the classification of salaries of the injured.
Are there resources allocated by the United Nations?
Will these funds go to any government or to United Nations offices, and will this aid actually reach the affected people?
The final conclusion, if there were no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Hello, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
This proposal is accepted by her.
Whoever is sufficient can write a direct letter to the UNESCO Secretary-General.
Let's move it to this box.
Or a productive factory.
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I'll go back to our guest to take call-in questions.
He explained that doctors had advised him to undergo surgery, but
It was a great expense and beyond his means, so where could he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other right, the rights granted to persons with disabilities
The citizen must obtain all these rights and duties.
To incorporate the agreement into the international convention for people with disabilities, this agreement is legal and connected.
And fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Applied to all countries and should be limited to ensure the application of these laws.
At least at the level of employees, there should be awareness.
It must be at least if we're working on these contracts this way.
Even if there isn't a great commitment to it.
Is there a response to the monitoring reports you conduct, and is there interest?
But don't forget the standards, they are actually a morally binding document, not legally.
You have a commitment and the clearances.
And realizing that these cases will either be filled, discussed, or will pass within the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Zahrana, Director, Qatar Disability Center, Sign Language Expert in Jazeera
First, Mr. Ali would like to sincerely thank Al Jazeera.
Who simplified this episode on air now.
Now Ali is talking and saying that he is very optimistic.
And he was a worker for all the people who needed help in the place where she was and waited for her.
And we support her and stand by her side always and forever.
I also say that there is a large number of people who suffer from special needs.
Some people don't know about this agreement because training sessions haven't been offered there.
Around them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries around the world.
And I insisted and urged these countries to
Accept this agreement and adhere to it.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving people.
Thank you very much, Nagi. I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion may influence a decision.
The former Special Adviser to the United Nations on Disabilities, we may start with a proposal presented by Adviser Ibrahim Abdullah from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Launching a fund to support
A fund for subscriptions and accepting any contributions from states
This means that the fund is intended to be used for activities prepared by the Special Representative when he is participating in
Even the Arab countries did not donate from one country: Syria
Addressing those commitments is a challenge faced by the United Nations, therefore.
The box
Lack of commitment by Member States, unfortunately, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people openly say that we don't care about the situation now.
In fact, it's a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
Broadly and generally
The excluded, especially
But for this reason, there are covenants.
But in order for these countries to fulfill their duties, it is a good idea suggested by the brother.
Besides, it is essential that there is no separate box, i.e., one independent in form, but rather the institutions that already exist in the region.
What they have in their budgets
I developed special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistants for people with disabilities
The issue always involves political factors.
The state or government has significantly affirmed its support.
Reduces the number unfortunately.
For nominal amounts
The father is injured.
Of course, he renounced his citizenship.
They took his daughter, Sha.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Traveling or going out, we get lost in confusion.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
They redefine themselves.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Karwan, from Kuwait.
Aisha Hammad from Welcome Train
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, dear friends.
Good evening to you and to Haya bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of children with special needs
For her continued support of Hissah.
Negligent to a noble man from Tunisia, welcome.
There is another level, and it is genetic.
I believe there is genetic intervention that reduces the proportion of people with skill impairments.
In our Arab customs, brothers always marry within the family, and this sequence continues.
Under this level, the level of disabilities and thank you.
Can you clarify what the viewers said?
Frankly, I said it at the national level.
I know there are mentoring and support programs.
Belongs to healthcare services.
Located under the Hamad Natural Roof
I believe within the psychiatric clinic and the programs of the Supreme Council for Education.
Special Education Department, frankly, I don't know if it still exists or not.
But certainly within healthcare services, yes, there is support and medical care.
These cases were provided with treatment and rehabilitation.
Prevention is better than cure, and this includes genetic factors and consanguineous marriage. Are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and crucial point.
And one of the things we talked about when we were with others is that there are too many words and too much sharing.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not targeted only at women.
Conducted by the World Health Organization
Also for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And surely Tunisia
There is now a binding decision for early examination.
And it has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is from a preventive standpoint.
Do they get a positive response from these campaigns?
Especially when it conflicts with customs and behaviors.
Of course, its difficulty becomes apparent when it clashes with the collective culture.
We have a decision, plans, and a desire to deal with it, and we are committed.
The issue of early screening, for example, because it is a very important issue before marriage.
Ask if there are statistics about people with disabilities.
Especially people affected from the Middle East region.
Arabic domain
Especially
Due to the recent events that occurred in the region.
In conflict zones and regions, especially in wars and conflicts.
For every person killed, three others are left disabled.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
No, it's not enough, and besides, the problem.
Based on the principle of human rights
There must be something for the disabled and their programs and plans.
The plan within the current institutions in government and non-government ministries.
Under circumstances such as war or unrest
Since you say so, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights denied it.
In the world, the strangest thing is what the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about the census.
To this extent, the disabled are not counted in statistics conducted for the population of settlements.
They don't always announce.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In cooperation with the Planning Council and in the presence of
It was prepared by the Council as a fact and in our presence as the office of the Special Representative.
Adding more categories for disorders
Assumed needs to exist
The types of these needs, all these important details that lead you to a result.
Is there someone broken or not?
But at least
Statistics are on their way in some respects in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you for your program, and thank you to Ms. Hasa.
But thank God I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
My daughter is currently a student at independent schools and is receiving a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Her motivational role and her role in preventing us from fearing or worrying about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, to her, and to those who rely on her in this difficult time.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, dear friends.
My dear sister, reality and hopes, and what we await is the solution to our children's problem.
What is the role of the lady in our Qatari children?
I hope you answer her this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
And I testify to what the State of Qatar has provided as a special service for hearing impairments.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
A distinguished educator.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Until the formation of civil society, civil organizations, or other communities.
Because reality and what we wish for, if compared in five years
What was provided to people with disabilities five years ago and currently.
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem from Jordan. Now we return to our guest.
Of course
Human beings as a whole, with its individuals and especially the family that possesses.
Children with disabilities have big goals and hopes too.
Either at the planning level or at the implementation level
But as for one of the points you mentioned, it's a very important one.
Children who are unable to obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or abroad.
An international agreement is like many international documents.
Plans and strategies have been adopted to translate them.
Automatically providing those services
Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or nationality.
Sure, Ms. Haisa, I previously worked as a Special Representative at the United Nations, focusing on obstacles, after two years of service.
Did you want?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or enough financial support.
A lot of achievements have been accomplished, and I am proud of that.
Through my participation, through ongoing institutions, and through government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
That there are more researches and larger studies.
I started with a global sweep and we got over a dozen reports.
Reporting on awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously and meticulously worked on.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among people themselves, persons with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty to fulfill.
They must fight for
Many thanks
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Yesterday, with God's pleasure, we met a new guest.
Stay with us for a new episode of "Preacher (of Life)" with your messages and letters. Best regards.
I named you with patience.
I'm very happy you're here with us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and talking to you this morning.
Thank you, Shaima, I might have celebrated.
The whole Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has truly marked its place on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
As I do, go Ali!
First, I'd like to say good morning to my colleagues.
Express my greetings and congratulations to him and all the citizens of Qatar for hosting
And if Allah wills, as Sheikh Muhammad said.
It was a dream, and if God wills, it will become a reality, and the work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did they expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Even though you have strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, didn't you feel afraid in this area, especially on this topic?
No, listen, I'm telling you frankly, there's a 70% chance you'll get the train.
This is very strong.
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitors.
Why do we fear?
But thank God, Qatar's file was very strong and it deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 World Cup file and its organization in Qatar
So, what do you think about the feeling that athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel great joy, God willing.
I want to be reminded, we were talking offline, but we want to hear it online.
The moment he announced it.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, did it excite you, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They were informed about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, thank God, everyone who offered us support.
The news of winning in Qatar and obtaining the lead.
All Arab states announced their full support for Qatar through the media, human resources, and future initiatives.
The Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even on international media levels, Shaima.
I had gone at that time to celebrate in the Souq Waqif.
Even Agence France-Presse used to film there.
We had also conducted interviews.
Everyone, currently in Qatar, is reminded daily.
One hundred times a day, to be the smallest place on Earth.
I suppose everyone will watch Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by joining the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatar League, wants to represent the team.
So, it's encouraging to see a great effort being made in the work.
Be in the championship, even if in the championship he tries his best.
Regarding practices or games, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must expend his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort in training the young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at multiple age levels. How was your experience, and what age level was the most important to you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step in the tournament, from the teenage team to the first team.
You know you're used to being in the mix with the team and the tournament.
So every stage has a distinctive mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We both now get used to you, athlete.
We always watch you as a sports enthusiast and enjoy following what you tell us about sports news, so how are you in sports?
Frankly, I don't see the difference between this and talk shows. In talk shows, we featured famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also featured stars.
As if Ali and others in the field of sports
In return, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the sports capital.
And now, Qatar has become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of presenting diverse programs in series, social, economic, and cultural shows
There are different competitions, basketball, handball, different speakers.
But it's still a sport.
Excellent, wonderful
I frankly wish
I wanted to be ten years old now, not twenty-five.
So I think the young players got a great opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is great for me, what do you say to athletes?
God willing, the young players who will succeed in the near future, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they should take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
So they have a big advantage over him.
Let us know what you're doing and what new shows you'll be converting. I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about the new, God willing.
Since we are continuously following up on events, we are preparing for the Asian Championship which will kick off in January.
In less than days, we finished the Gulf Cup, but we would like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The news average is also available for event coverage.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatar TV, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I am enabling their ways.
Forward a media message across different channels
Whether it's private, sports, or other channels
So, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you all the best, we are still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of the Alwakra Club.
And his followers, I was in the upper echelon of the club.
My daughter
The sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasr was with us.
He's still at the club.
I am still the son of Al-Ula.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
What belongs to every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people love sports and are used to it.
How to Make Sports a Social Issue
Media awareness primarily plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
She said that the youth are used to it, and that schools have recognized the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate a sports event.
As in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, reflecting an awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and wherever applicable.
This also indicates the awareness and involvement of women in the field of sports.
And now we have a Qatari women's league for female players.
So I think sports are evolving.
I also think that this period
To produce large projects and increase awareness of sports, I believe the current period is sufficient.
If consideration and implementation are done carefully.
Enough, and that's why it should be used wisely, as I said.
Also, there's a point, which is how young people benefit from the championship.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's also an important point, thank God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are known for our love of sports.
How do you engage this audience to keep up with sports news, football matches in Qatar?
And attending matches at the same time
Many residents of Qatar love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you shop in internet forums, you'll find that there is a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football championship.
As a Qatari citizen, what is your opinion on the best way to attract you to attend, aside from being a player or athlete?
What are some ways to attract an audience to attend the event, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering at home.
For instance, Japan designed a distinctive plan to attract the public greatly.
When you go to meetings, you gather points or something, so they're looking for solutions, so we hope.
and Arabic
The most important point is that every player will move to Qatar especially in 2022, Lana, what do you think we need?
Since financial support is what we need, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to prepare them as a team from the Qatari league and participating in the major world championship.
Time flies when you're with good people, and when the producer told me our time was up, I said, "Really? God willing."
We achieve what was impossible, realizing the dream we thought was impossible. Thanks to God, we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Muhammad said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work has begun.
And if God wills, 2022 will be an event known as Qatar.
I congratulate all residents of Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global brand.
To accommodate for 2022
Thank you, Lana, the amazing presenter. I wish you all the best, and I will always follow your shows to stay updated on sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Distinguished Qatari Youth
They are singing a new type that is loved today.
But with a repetitive style, music, and a fast tone.
Also a team of beginners in rap, God willing.
Stay with us, we start now, good morning.
We try to review it.
Rap can simply be defined as fast music.
It is performed by repetition, but not a rushed delivery of the words in the song.
It consists of a large number of verses and covers a variety of different topics and issues.
It may sometimes be personal.
Social, emotional, or political.
He is often controversial.
And producing much fruit.
In rap music, the audience does not sing the lyrics of the song.
But he repeats it.
He conceals in his voice what is considered a secondary element.
Generally, the voice doesn't matter in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or rap performer.
Rap music incorporates the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, the flow of sounds, synchronization, and presentation.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a special style of rap.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
The first thing was a period when we wanted to do something new.
To be exceptional at something.
So we said, why don't we rap?
And debate is an art present in all global nations.
So, why wasn't it found in Qatar?
So, we said that we're inventing something new.
We gave him an idea encompassing a message.
We discuss the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, we send a message first, then it's art.
This is an art form, meant for the viewer's consideration, and it has addressed many social and psychological issues among young people to a great extent.
Time changes, and that's why I think this is related to changing times.
Before that, there was a simple acceptance.
We were singing, around 2005, acceptance was little at first.
We can say that our renewal began in 2010.
There is more acceptance and popularity.
People love to sing and perform in a rap style these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a large percentage of people.
There's also something we want to talk about, you've been creating in many teams.
A beautiful collection, and I think you organize shows. Can we talk about this collection?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that someone could start a band, and how many of you are there in this band?
Initially, before the team was formed,
Rap music arrived in Doha in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and download it from the site.
I can carry, Salman can carry, anyone can carry, so there was a competition.
We introduced the people.
So we started competing with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we reached 2010.
Before 2010, there was a group system, meaning this group was separate, and three or four would gather together.
So we said, why don't we unite as one group under the name Rappers Qatar?
Or in English, rap Q.
So we agreed on this, we said under one name, and we are all in one hand.
And they move on to display this thing and convey the same idea.
About twenty people.
Twenty-five, wow! If God wills, this is a great team.
So, does any of you sing or tell stories, or do you all?
Reorganize and coordinate.
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how is this 25 organized? How is this number organized in the team?
Everyone has their own potential.
This means that every person in the team can produce a complete song.
Without the help of another person.
But capabilities can differ, for example if Salman is better than me,
He would listen to her and tell me, "Change the words, change something."
Each might turn into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that takes you, until these works are taken by an official entity.
And there will be health distributors.
To achieve professional and amazing results and make it official.
Frankly, we wish for support, and we get support from a company that came, took us, and promoted our album.
We don't have any problems.
Some things are a little difficult.
So, why don't you think the first innovation starts with you?
Insert the first CD.
By doing this, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a disc.
I sent it among my friends.
What is the size of the order?
I believe.
Average because in 2007 Rap did not control the Gulf.
But it wasn't as pleasant as today.
We were talking before the broadcast started, for example, there are big teams like Valencia and Carsto.
Are we talking about him?
They said we will organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; we didn't expect this level of honesty.
Frankly, he amazed us and did an excellent job.
But there was a little pressure because there were no ads and nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the event.
We thought that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were coming in, before the party started.
It was a good point.
Which means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal only to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a large number of songs, and we were many.
The whole group
What are words, and how do they deal with different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, he was even *
Even if they talked before *
It must be like this.
I mean, there's a parallel.
We think about every word and try to find better expressions.
Sure, you have a few songs, let's hear one of them.
One of the songs you produced
Let's hear him out and see what the public thinks.
I hope they love the words.
Thank you, Ali. I love the introduction because it includes the name of my show.
This is KD's program and DJ MREldoha.
Heavens, Ladies and Sisters
This is KJ, Ms. Bobo with SKT, one hot body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch it.
A product of Hassan Naama, presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
The president is Nasser Al-Malaqi, and the guests are Rabers from Qatar, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you friends!
I need to pray with my hands so that I can pray for the people in the control room.
We announced it last night.
And who wrote the words, was it him?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
They don't write like this for the love of singing and passion.
I assume you're writing about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I suppose you can.
Sure, personally, we'll crown a song about this subject.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
So I assume there are national songs that should exist.
Through the art of rap
Yes, indeed, today, all people.
We're watching a live stream now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
So, viewers, as we've seen, Doha is being decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The competent authorities have made all the necessary preparations to host.
And there will be larger gatherings.
I suppose they'll be spreading out along the Cornish side.
I'm sure they are ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up in the next few days?
There is an offer from one side, and they promised to organize a party for us.
But, there are still some complications.
The procedures and some problems, so we don't know.
So we'll try, if we find Youssef and see.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of its implementation.
When I am at home
And he sent it to Joseph via email.
This part of the song is dedicated to Youssef.
There's something else, are you going abroad?
In this field, who has millions of followers?
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to those who are ahead in this field.
But we try to be competitive.
So, why don't we take some ideas and copy some things?
But I reverse it, I invest the idea and apply it differently in my songs.
Who formed a band and has more than one album.
A person named Abdullah Al-Adil
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This skill is the ability to detect sources of groundwater.
A resident of Marrat
There is a large number of experts.
Those who determine the location of groundwater before starting to dig.
Who needs to or may cap some wells where there is no water.
Using metal poles and olive branches
Or radishes, through which he can find water sources.
What tools are used?
Finding groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, they have been replaced with rubber bars.
So, we placed the two ribbons side by side.
Hold fast to the path with speed.
We observe, when we walk by the river of water.
The bars will work to open them.
Now, we move on to another water series.
It opens like this.
When we cross it, it starts.
Now we are in the middle of a water river.
And so, you will become the medium.
So, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater in the earth.
The process should be repeated more than once in more than one place to determine the most severe location.
Abu Ibrahim confirmation
Once I reached an advanced stage in this career
Because his discoveries are very accurate.
In Marath, outside Marath, in Shakra, Horai and Ethia.
Over one hundred and fifty good caves have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed 5%.
He needs training, experience, and God's grace.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
Very quickly
Abu Rahma Marshad
Morning Show
Tuwaiq, west of the northern city of Saudi Arabia, Riadh.
We are monitoring this report and assure you of reports from Arab countries and global nations.
And the Gulf countries, if Goff wanted
And we arrived at different addresses, but they are all hers.
Its important meaning
I suppose there's a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Who specifically do you follow as a role model?
To follow instead of imitate.
There is a general relationship among all rap singers in the Gulf.
It's not a competition, I mean, if I were to produce a song.
Deals with a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have connections, but no one is...
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He
He has followers and a disk jewel.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you wish to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it by more, God willing.
We wish you all the best through this team.
Here, upon receiving the cup, let's watch some video from the corniche.
By adding a group of Qatari youth
He, even if he quotes from the West, does so in a Gulf style.
There are also rap songs and a unique band of 25 people.
It's important to follow you to stay updated on your news.
Did you assume you had an email, website, or forum?
How can people contact you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the accommodation company.
It would sometimes close without apparent reason.
So, we faced many problems and eventually closed them.
No use, the site will definitely close.
So, what do we do, and what are the alternatives, to solve this question?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Algeria
You should connect with them to keep up with the new news and music that is produced from time to time.
So, what are the alternatives now?
We currently rely on special pages like
Under what name
Sure, when you search for our name on Google.
Rap in Qatar or rappers in Qatar
You can produce your own video.
Regarding the program, I worked on it yesterday.
Upload many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
A song and itself, with pictures.
I think we need to see more improvement from you.
You need a place that brings you all together instead of having the devices in each of your homes.
Mixer, keyboard, computer, and guitar.
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
And allocated a special place for us.
We're working on our own thing.
In fact, we're still working on our own things.
We don't want that.
No different from what Joseph said.
We need a short video.
And album
Videos contribute to the rapid spread of misinformation.
Speeds up thought rapidly.
If there's support, everything will move forward eventually.
And your beautiful voice resonates everywhere.
This is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Animi and Salem Al-Abdullah, for attending.
We promote and deliver success to them from our program, friends.
These projects were, yes.
There is a project that is almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to pay, the total amount and details are pre-filled.
Goods are recognized instead of reading the components of each good.
While walking with the cart
Welded to the cart, so he can choose the material he wants.
Many projects reflect children's feelings towards a problem.
Contains many activities and goals.
The central offers a range of programs and activities focused on a core idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Excellency Sheikh Moza in establishing the center.
It might be so, yes.
which takes him directly to the underground metro from his house
But its concept is that it is dedicated to clothing.
All stores in Qatar that sell t-shirts appear.
It could be with the car key, press the button.
He prepares the lost keys and hands them over to me for the house.
Yes, let's go back to the signals that the center will be working on.
Early childhood education
Skills development and talent adoption
So, it varies between children's skills, media skills, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and influencing an audience.
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to accommodate that.
We started with Future Media, achieved good results in this project, reached the end, and the project study was concluded.
As we obtained numbers for children and youth who speak the language.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
For those who have a television, it's important to show programs for children.
We are preparing them for the radio.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We raise them until they turn eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
It's also the national television.
We need to attract, identify, and develop these talents.
Either media or research.
Cognitive Dimension
Reading and diverse other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the expanding speakers' program organized by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition, the Generations Exhibition, is also...
The science group played an important role in improving projects, as well as in technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Committee, through supporting schools and partners.
Sixth Abdullah, moving to a building like this one in Katara,
which also includes a range of activities and active pursuits
Do you see this as progress towards greater success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very large place
Facilitates dealing with the public
It is an initiative and wonderful project.
And providing hospitality and introducing them to the programs offered to the child.
This is our main project over the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the supervision of Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She acknowledged and supported her project.
This is a large project, encompassing content development, storytelling, and child development.
Various cultural skills related to reading in specific situations.
Since there are certainly different programs
We have recently moved.
And so we're rearranging some activities.
Design and improve it to suit Katara visitors.
We would like to wish you good luck through this center.
Contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting us.
The most important thing is that the more we treat children, the more we discover that
Childhood today is different from our childhood.
They need more details, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, imagination.
Contacting him mentally.
They... %pw, the way they raise their children, like a motel, they provide accommodation.
Or like a bank, it provides money.
Children really need someone to hear these thoughts, and imagination.
In the past few days, we have been transferred to 2030.
At this exhibition
Wishing you success in your endeavors.
Thank you for your presence, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jamali, Director of the Child Culture Center. We wish you success.
To realize these projects, and not let them remain a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Child Culture Center launched its party last night at the Diplomacy Club.
The closing ceremony of the "Dreams of Future Generations" exhibition titled "Dreams of Generations: Reality or the Future Homeland"
Organized as part of Qatar's National Day celebrations, with the participation of over seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
And the creative projects of our children
We welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jamali, Director of the Child Culture Center, good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my loving sister.
First, I would like to thank you for taking the time.
Talking about this exhibition is truly remarkable.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover all possible exhibition activities.
This is a nation's exhibition for the aspirations of generations.
In the name of Allah, the Most Great, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
In contribution to the Child Culture Center
To celebrate the national day
Who had it
By trying to control the children
Living with a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So we said we are limited to twenty or thirty.
And other areas of Qatar's vision, twenty thirty.
I started training children in four stages.
Then, consider the mechanism of groupthink and the methods that broaden the scope of thinking.
What is the exact meaning of this phrase?
Is it facts or the state tomorrow?
That is, anything a child dreams of today.
It will grow as the project grows.
In fact, this was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children would live from this day forward.
With big dreams
Either the environment, health, human development, or any other field.
He who serves the country.
I think we know there are children somewhere.
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
The show, there were also guest stars.
Children learn from them, as ideal examples.
Yesterday, or three days ago, there was *
There were winners of various awards in the Arabian Gulf region.
It was a table to display their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a photo gallery of the event and various activities.
Here is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
An excellent idea, it can be simplified for the public, this is one of the innovations of children.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, four or five projects on this subject appear, one of which is the colored ball.
And the smart stadium was also named.
As soon as he kicks the ball out of bounds.
The colors differ.
I suppose this will help a lot in future matches.
What's after, after all these dreams?
And cling to the thing used in its place of duty.
I suppose that especially when there are responsible people, they take into consideration these small projects from small ideas.
But we don't know, maybe these projects will serve us. What did the football association president say?
I'm thinking about the idea of the colored ball.
Does he love her?
To a large extent, he visited projects related to soccer.
We endorsed and joined his projects the moment we saw him.
And I acknowledge these plans as well.
What our children did, people elected many projects.
Okay, what were the most voted-on projects that were announced?
Broad evaluation, and they have a way of evaluating projects.
First, second, and third place projects that won the awards.
The forest won the first prize.
He was precise in the details of the project and the project was prepared for implementation.
Of course, it needs many administrative elements.
The details were very precise in the pamphlet distributed to visitors.
Certainly these are the images we are seeing now.
These are some of the big projects.
Perhaps what they're trying to do is what they see in movies and cartoons.
It's truly, part of it is accredited by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects. What are these projects?
Friday, usage, and update
One hundred forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of 447 students from the thirty-ninth batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohannad Al-Attiyah, Minister of International Cooperation
A large number of parents and teachers
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Mawjoud and maintain the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will have a very dear guest.
From the Tisanev family, the actor Abdelhamid Charachani.
He announces himself through many works such as "Hearts for Rent."
They established themselves with effort on the artistic stage.
Especially since the field of art does not know appreciation.
Which of those means
Thank you and good morning, and I will say good morning to the audience.
No, I'm a fan of the show's team.
We'll watch a short scene from one of your works, and then we'll start talking with you.
Are you laughing at me?
Took the fake Besht and sent the original.
Go get it.
Possess the pasture, you will restore it.
What? Give me the shoes, return them! How do I return them?
The cow already completes it in her belly, man!
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
On the conference's steering committee.
I don't agree with you.
I have no objection.
So this is a quick look, a short piece from the Tesaneef series that we'll be watching Part 2 of.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your segments, as the series "Tesaneef" covers a different topic in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
We passed by Marrat at that time.
She passed by, counting the mountain as well-known.
The comet that poets celebrated all the time.
When history is a witness and an age in the memory of cities,
And reflect its ancient history.
It is located 170 kilometers north of the capital Riyadh.
Some believe that his name became famous after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its ancient monuments, the purity of its water, and its cool atmosphere.
The poets were influenced by him and enthusiastic about him; he was famous because of Mount Kumait.
They call it the Komait River.
Of course, Marrat City is an ancient city.
It was established before Islam.
Some ancient things simplified history, like the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we are in now.
The righteous prophet Khalid bin Walid commanded that this water source be sealed when he passed through during the wars of estrangement.
It still exists until now.
The feeling says: Ensure quantity, and take care of quality.
If you see Comait, you see Marah.
Another ancient relic is the Komait River.
O water of my youth that flows through the years.
She has enough money to last her a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
And the birth of these places is unlawful.
There are also illusions and delusions.
Mount Komait is one of the landmarks of the city of Maraat.
There were many proverbs, poems, and songs built around this mountain.
Many people come to him from different parts of the kingdom.
One of the most notable ancient remains in this place is the Al-Waleedi Well.
This is because he was present in Mecca during the Wars of Apostasy and was on the way to Yamamah.
He resided there and commanded people to dig this lake.
What people still drink from its water and wash with it?
Yaqut al-Hamawi noted in his dictionary of countries that Khalid passed through Marrat.
This is an old house made of mud, and it has been repaired in a preliminary way.
It consists of multiple sections that showcase the region's architectural features, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet said about it: "When we faced the water, it was free water."
We encountered the Komit River, not the Anjel River.
Mr. Ayman, there is cooperation between the family, agents, the center, and the child's son, as God wills.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Since anything that comes to us, whether it be the trainee, the student, or the child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, get a rating every month.
We were responsible for the camouflage program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
Monitoring through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he access it?
Yes, considering what he has achieved, from his entry into the center until now.
Yes, we have different models that we'll look into.
We have a girl.
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later,
We'll get to know different models, I wish we had enough space.
But we entered a model of a girl.
It will dive deeper into the air after you.
We'll answer her math questions and a variety of questions.
We'll be right back after a short break, and then we'll return to see this smart girl. Stay tuned.
The performance is over, the audience is now dispersing.
If he encounters any task from the first, second, or third continuations and feels that the task is not relevant to him, he will use the remote.
He doesn't worry himself, he has another series of 20 thousand.
Correct, twenty thousand series, yes.
One hundred thousand episodes. There are people who don't focus on one task.
He can see other works.
Sure, that's the majority.
He says I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, a very respected and beloved guest, Abdel Hamid Charshani.
Would you like to say something to the audience, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I am one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I tell them: I hope you find every year in good health.
It's true that we rarely go out, don't show up much, and don't move around a lot, for a reason, and I've already mentioned the reason.
What comes will be better.
God willing, we wish you success in your endeavors this year.
If God wills, we will meet you again to talk about those games.
Everything leads to another.
Because fashion shows are popular among many people and are eagerly awaited by trend enthusiasts.
Welcome with us in Sabaa Al-Dha and we'll be with you live.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who joined this center.
This compound offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other capabilities.
And also to fully exercise their brains.
Ms. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Kholji, Executive Director of the Document Prepared for Skill Development.
Hello and good morning.
She welcomes us.
We watched anime with him, good morning anime.
Your direction.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Masha'Allah, we wish you all the best.
What is offered to our sons and daughters?
This was explained with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and specific guidance was provided for the benefit of our children.
The program dedicated to the mental understanding of mathematics.
With the finger and frowning.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to present a small part of it.
Did you feel, Mr. Ibrahim, that there was a difference between the student in the first two days?
And after maybe three or four months?
Whether he learns in public, private, or even independent schools,
Simply put, the scientific program works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
that demonstrate wasted capabilities or the need for continued development
Has it reached a certain level or what updates have occurred to the child?
So, we work on a scientific method, a scientific program.
These are not methods and mechanisms that are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific and organized manner.
Before starting the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers, Aomenia is one of the students who registered at this place.
We wanted to do that today right away, to show our viewers the importance of these matters.
If you want to return the shoes, I have no problem with that.
So this is a very quick piece and a small part of the Tesaneef series, and we'll continue with Part 2.
But as we saw, this part of the series Tesaneef is the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tesaneef," where each episode tackles a different topic?
This year, focus on "y".
Inattentive virtuous
Who encourages by providing opportunities
Sixteen serials in nine volumes.
He will be a director in a series, a series that will feature an old man, and a series that will feature bread.
So, they are a series of events.
Mr. Ganim Al-Salati from Qatar.
We have representatives from Train.
I can't remember many actors now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafet, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Vasil Rashid and Mohamed Adel.
Tara, of course
The boys can't play without Tara.
We now have a few projects in Qatar. There are two projects per year.
Do Qatari channels produce drama series, can we say that?
Qatar Channel presents an administrative product.
Qatar TV did the best they could, but with only one production a year, all of Qatar's actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
She replied to me. This is just one series, and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
So, if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Thank God for everything.
So, let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I want to thank him a lot.
He is consulted on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasim from the series "Hukm Al Bashr", after the hiatus even yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater.
So, he is the one who took us, taught us, and made us.
Then Mr. Ganim entered his life story, and worked as best he could, in the 2000 Toastmasters International Speech Contest.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They work 30 to 32 days a year.
We have two vacations a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The threatened feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The chain manager is Mr. Monir %PW.
We return to our loving colleagues, and today we talk about reverse medicine.
The message from the hand, hand of the hand.
This treatment has indeed been applied since ancient times.
We have a guest.
This evaluation method:
It's amplified, the degree of pain.
You can feel inside the hand that there is something like sand or divided vessels inside the hand.
Take out your hand.
Al-Sahbi's sons are tense.
It feels tight and you sense a slight pressure.
Left side.
Now, beloved people, let's review the left side of his body.
For they know what we do.
Every health problem will be clear, we now know about the headaches and dizziness he suffers from.
Is there any pain here?
Sneezing is considered a problem.
Problem! What does the word "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the nose, the ear.
This is shaking, do you have an ear problem or any previous problem?
I was doing surgery, but that was a long time ago.
Is he atheist or something?
He gains weight without eating.
No, your left shoulder.
This is because of the member, when I told him he had a tense member.
Ten years ago, he was walking on the beach without feet.
We know that when a person walks on the beach, I think he empties himself.
Any uneven surface is not just the sea.
Negative energy that may affect %PW.
It might be possible that I would be surprised that you discovered these things through messages.
Of course, children are the most important.
The young ones, praise be to God, these are for the mother, pay attention to me!
What he composes of milk and the food he eats.
Her child is incompatible with her, she will give birth and it will automatically close.
Close your hand.
Simply, a little pressure, thank God.
You will find it in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, he will suffer pain due to the pain here.
Then, you will see the gases suddenly escape.
What discoveries do you make, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bone issues, headaches, thyroid problems, and weight gain.
The second thing for menstrual pains or period pains in general.
You must focus on a stone or stones, by pressing here, you give orders, God is praised for lower back pain and related period problems. If you have pain,
If God wills, it will be extinguished in seconds.
Pregnant woman
Delivery has become easier for her.
Or here or there, and God knows best.
If they tell her there's a chance she'll give birth on the seventh or the ninth.
Except if it's on sand.
If you walk on sand, no problem, but if you walk on rocks, no.
You should eat seven black olives for breakfast, black olives are better.
If you don't have soft fruits, regular fruits will do.
As Allah the Great said: "I seek refuge in Allah from the devil who has possessed me, and my place in the Quran."
This means that God could not have allowed this hard-core group to reach her, no, He could not.
Thank God, and I ask for the grace of the word to be.
You must bring a stone or small balls.
Kinesthetic delivery. For example, if you forget and end up in kinesthetic delivery, hold onto the booth.

Cooperate with each other, I recommend to everyone who hears me now.
Make goodness a habit and take care of others. I created you to worship God and then
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a preacher, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank my lord Abdulaziz for this wonderful interview, and also thank the guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council of Health, will discuss this further.
A blessed ascension, my Lord.
Let's start by studying these activities.
The program: Healthy Steps for Qatar
Is the program part of the national strategy to treat and combat obesity?
Four of the most obese countries are in the Gulf.
We launched a strategy with the Ministry of Education and other institutions in the Supreme Council of Health to combat obesity.
It is feared that it will spread further and further soon.
One of the obesity prevention programs is "Healthy Steps for Qatar."
We can organize this competition together, making it an international one.
The program consists of two weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To inform seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because this is the first age in which they become conscious of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about what your favorite fruit is.
The second week is walking.
You need to walk! The more you walk, the more points you get.
This is a map of Qatar, and whenever someone earns points, they move, relocate their school, and change their class.
So a beautiful competition is created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink alcohol.
We tell him to drink water, there is no need to drink a large amount of black every time you feel hungry, don't drink water!
Then, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport he loves.
Because we want to force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that he should allow his child to eat a healthy meal.
And Island Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take it.
Of course, this is an example, and if it succeeds, God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and radiate more energy.
We need more games, we had a lot of fun with our colleagues.
The two girls say their skin has improved and acne has decreased.
Sure, sure, consciousness dawns.
Parents teach their children.
And their companions, in various categories, ask them, "How are you?" and they learn from their friends.
And thanks to God, many schools are already prepared to intentionally participate next year.
If God wills.
The official stance was to continue supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which hosted sports festivals and awareness events.
On the table.
So, thank God, there are many aspects, some of which I have mentioned and some I have not.
But thank God everyone shared a part.
And otherwise, the brothers did it in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
There was variety.
We tried to offer different types and attract as many people as possible.
They are the coming generations.
Let's spread this experience or its dissemination in Qatar as widely as possible.
When you assess, there's something you need to fix.
After its spread now and satisfactory results.
If God wills, we will expand because there are people asking us why we weren't there.
Complete, complete healthy food, and end with it, do not repeat.
When we start at this young age, we'll reach what we want by 20 or 25.
The specifier mentions a consistent set of signs, and every consistent set is a sign.
If we return, we'll run today in our sector about closing events.
And if we remind people again, in our program, we had more than one offer.
Let's repeat, what information do we want to convey to the student every week?
Undoubtedly, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Each chapter was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits containing vitamin C?
So, he starts to love vegetables, and not all vegetables are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is about walking. Do people think that walking is only for the elderly and not for the young?
That is, when I grew up, I started to walk.
On the other hand, you walk because it calms your mind and brain.
It reduces pressure on the individual, thus improving mental clarity.
I took the two students for a walk.
Yes, they were all required to walk in line, both at home and at school.
They coordinate their points through the teacher in class.
What they used to walk on every day.
It was an event, there were people who held a march, the girls' school held a march.
We want them to love this, being creative with a unique idea.
Teachers and the competitive spirit must think outside the box, and we don't want to give them ideas that they can just memorize.
Everyone has their skill in this aspect.
Of course, in the third week we drink water, we always try to make them drink water, so they don't feel hungry and remember to drink black.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we know his favorite sport and support him in it,
He will take care of sports.
Since he loves sports by doing them, he unconsciously engages in sports.
We said earlier that we would talk about the Cancer Society in Qatar.
Welcome our guest of today's episode, who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are delighted by your presence at this exhibition.
And among them is an illness that some of us know as "some disease."
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
This is a chronic disease.
which affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The gap between twenty and forty years.
There are no treatments for this disease so far, and the causes of the disease are unknown.
It affects the active group in society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm from another disease.
This disease is an infection in the brain's nervous system and the spinal cord's nervous system.
The central nervous system in the human body.
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered the body.
Neuron
Cover this wire.
The white cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
which leads to the non-arrival of the nerve signal, or atrophy, or interruption.
Leads to a stop, God protect you.
No, with the advancement and development in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Undoubtedly, apart from the solution, we want to know how to obtain it.
The person should also be informed about this thing.
The main reason is quality of life, or the nature of food, or the flow of life?
Or what is the direct cause that prompts a person to be affected by this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even in marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems suffered by humans.
Yes, yes.
All these topics may be controversial in one way or another in society.
So far, we know his reasons.
Undoubtedly, the age group that may be affected by multiple cancer.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years of illness, it starts to calm down with the person.
So far, we haven't found a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of many in the Gulf, or in the Arab world, or are we talking about Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have 25,000 cases.
And Qatar as well.
Recently, just last week, I was informed of three to four diagnosed cases.
Now, we have one hundred and twenty patients, that's what's signed in the files.
Many go to other countries for treatment after being diagnosed with this disease.
Without Professor Abdulaziz, are there any effects as if someone complained of this illness?
Are there any signs that show the family or patients that they are suffering from multiple neuropathy?
And the exporter, for example, is killed.
We need to be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Since the disease is in the nerves, the nerves control the whole body.
When giving a specific reason related to a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
